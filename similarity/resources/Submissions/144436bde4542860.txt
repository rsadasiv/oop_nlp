Story title: The Dream Peddler 

*THE DREAM PEDDLER* 

*S**IDDHANT* *V P**, **N**EW* *D**ELHI**, **I**NDIA* 

*I dreamt of fairies and angels and wizards,* 

*I dreamt of conquering forbidden deserts.* 

*I dreamt of sailing to magical lands.* 

*I opened my eyes - I was a Man.* 

*12th March, 1915* 

*1912* was a year when an incipient tension was creeping into every mortal mind. The myriad occurrence of battles around the globe portended a magnificent war in the offing. A fervor of patriotism swept across every country and casual talks among friends, folks and neighbours turned into impassioned discussions and audacious claims of how they would lay down their life to defend the sanctum of their motherland. It wasn't wholly, the love for their country but the fear of extinction, which was making them fearless. 

For me, it was just another day in my peripatetic life. I was on board a crowded ship sailing to Prudensla, an island miles off the eastern coast of Greece. Albeit the name of the ship was Greek to me, and neither did I havethe curiosity to know the translation, I was adequately convinced that the locals referred to it by a shorter name, the way one addresses a fast friend. As I walked along the gangway, I saw an old wooden ladder on which probably many a captain had been up and down. It was an old and wearyvessel, and hadn't been tended to for long. It should have been demolished long before today, but yet it cruised over the palpitating ocean, like a colossal mountain, Olympus or something. 

Today, I am an affluent man, to put it modestly, and would never resort to a crowded mode of transport like this, but two years ago, I was only moderately rich, because I had not met the Sultan then. 

It was a time when the day was losing its sheen, while the night was gaining hers. The dark shadows of bobbing heads lined up along the edge of the deck, floated on the ocean, and gradually slipped under the ship with the sinking sun. I flitted from starboard to port, from head to stern, scouring the deck to find a place to rest my fatigued body. As the nippy night settled in, the crowd on the deck started to thin out. It was got darker and windier. There, at the head of the ship, I noticed a figure of a thin man, wrapped in a sullied shirt - its tatters fluttering against the direction of our sail. The dry, untamed Etesian winds bruised my face as I trudged towards the man. I looked at him, as he kept staring right ahead, like the marvelously crafted, time-enduring figurehead of the Unicorn beneath us. Retreating cheekbones and pointed face gave away his providence-Caucasian most certainly , I thought. I looked around to see nothing, except a distant lighthouse beacon, lurking in the mist hovering above the sea. There was an unprecedented calmness in the waters. A sea should not ever be this docile- it loses its sheen. 

A baritone voice broke through the unwarranted silence, "Are you not glad to see a landmass after a longtime?" the bearded old man spoke, looking up at the moon. I was taken aback by this sudden verbal intervention. Yet, he continued, unflinchingly, in a manner which suggested that we have known each other from Adam. "When I was a young boy, I used to gaze out of the window at the starry sky. I wished to reach the moon, tread upon its cool soil, kick up the white dust and run berserk everywhere. My mother said, "It is an impossible dream, no one can touch the moon" But isn't that the quintessential nature of dreams- being impossible. It would be a waste of dream to dream something which is *possible*. But mother wanted me to have adream 'worthwhile'. After that, I never talked to her about it", with his head still tilted upwards at the moon, he rolled down his eyes on me, "Have you not ever dreamt of touching the moon?" 

I did not know why he was talking to me in the first place, yet I participated in the conversation, which had so far been a monologue. "With all due respect, your mother would not have been more correct. No one can reach the moon. I can tell you that I had my share of loony dreams as well. But rather more heartfelt ones than the ones I have now", a slight smile broke out on my face, as if remembering an old friend. "As a 8 year old, I used to pretend to be Heron, or some other civil war hero. My friend Duma and I used to run through the labyrinth of our village and scamper up the hill and when at the top, raise my wooden sword and announce my dominance on the world. I wanted to be irremovably placed in the minds of posterity- like Alexander or Napoleon or King Arthur. It was a nincompoop desire, because I knew, and so did Duma, that I can never disrupt the history of the future, because my sword wasn't sharp enough. Yet I secretly dreamed on." 

"Just around the same time a war of mighty anthropogenic losses broke out. In an insane fit of patriotism my father left me and mama and joined the republican army. Mama used to say that father had gone to trade war for peace. My papa was a simple, peace loving man, and I could never comprehend what made him pick up those paraphernalia of death and head to the war front. 

Every night I pulled my knees close to my chest and lay shivering in the cold night. I heard the swooshing blades cutting through my father's flesh, the thud of his falling body and the ugly grin of his slayer.  I felt an unbridled pulse of vengeance cruise through my body and I would sit up on the straw mattress, clench my fist and in wild throes of passion, repeatedly pound the floor. I felt strong. I felt indomitable. That's when mama would run up to me, engulf me in her arms, press my teary face to her bosom and whisper in my ear "Papa will come back with peace". Suddenly, I felt small and powerless, because through mama's words I realized that Peace is a bigger dream, while violence is a transitory emotion that lasts for a lifetime among weaklings. 

A year ahead, the war reduced to *just* a battle. Every morning a batch of bloody men would trickle into our village. Some stayed back because they belonged to my village, some stayed back because death made them, the rest filed out, may be to live or die somewhere else. They were merchants and buyers, tailors and wearers, teachers and learners, writers and readers, all turned into warriors by circumstances. My eyes use to shuffle between every face, as I hoped to find my dad, or may be not. I had seen those men.They were better dead than alive. 

Since then, battles became a perfunctory affair in my beleaguered country. We fought for land, we fought for water, we fought over forests, we fought over gods and we fought over fights. I could no longer run up to the hill and brandish the harmless weapon. 

My Papa never came back. We never found out which battle took his life, or would he be still fighting on one of the war fields, hoping- battle after battle- to return home. We waited until the last of the inhabitants evicted the village. I remember turning around to look at the somber hill. I didn't want to be Napoleon anymore, all I wanted was a calmer world - and my father. 

Then there comes an age in every man's life, when he finds himself standing on the cusp of two kinds of dreams - the ones untouched and unmarred by the realities of life and others, the more practical kind, which originate out of the mind of a seasoned liver. It is quite obvious that one must tread upon the latter, dream of more achievable nature, else one shall flounder in darkness for the remainder of his life. What a wasteful life it would have been had I stuck to those foolhardy dreams of the past? I wanted to be a tradesman, like my father and I became one, a rather successful one at that. Today I am on this voyage to buy exotic birds from Prudensla, which I will exhibit to the great Sultan, who is a connoisseur of exotic animals and a very hard man to please. If the deal gets through, I will be beneficiary to huge fortune." 

Silence filled the space between us. I did not know why I told him what I did. 

The old man looked composed, pensive, but not surprised on this sudden revelation by a stranger. The old man spoke pensively, "Aye, I am honoured you opened up to me. You see good friend, you are a man who understands business very well, and you would most certainly like my proposition. Sell me all your dreams of the past. In return, I will pass you a more attainable dream. May be you would like to impress the Sultan with your pageantry of beautiful birds, wouldn't you?" 

That was the most befuddling offer I had come across during all my extensive years of travelling.  "Who *are* you?" I asked. 

"I am a trader like you. We are brethren in profession, although not inproduct." 

I was unconvinced. "Who would buy such loony dreams?" 

"The world is specked with dreamers. I will find a fool to sell it to." 

That night I traded my past dreams with him, for a dream that made me magnificently wealthy. 

For some time thereafter, he peered into the infinite darkness of the night, while I lingered upon a nagging thought. "Whom did *you* sell your dream to?" I asked curiously. 

There was a momentary lull in the tumultuous waters. It was as if the nature wanted to hear the old man's response as well. I saw his side face warp as he smiled and whispered into the cold night, "To no one". 

And the black sea roared back again. 

*** 

After thirteen months of globe-trotting, I harked back home to my family, as an immensely rich and considerably well-known man in the aristocratic circle. I stood in front my house, which sat under the umbrageous tree looking quiet and peaceful. Soon, four of my darling children gushed out of the old mahogany door and pounced on to me. Behind them walked my lovely wife and we all walked back to the house, where my mother had been waiting. I was about to head upstairs to mother's bedroom, when my wife beckoned and handed me a white envelope. I slipped out a piece of paper out of it. It read, in an untidy handwriting: 

*"Dear good friend,* 

*I look back at our chance meeting on the ship and feel that the journey outlasted our conversation. Good friend, you did well to unburden yourself with those luring monster-like dreams. They never materialize, but cling to your mind like leeches, sucking out the vitality of your soul. * 

*I presume that you would be keen to know who bought your dreams. Although I cannot tell you their names, not on grounds of principals but on grounds of my failing memory, I can most certainly give you a description that I remember. I sold your dream of dominating the world to** a young soldier in Deutschland. He was not a tall man, unlike most of his countrymen, but certainly had a remarkable personality. The dream of world peace was **bought by** a middle aged **gentleman** from India. I faintly remember him introducing himself as a lawyer.* 

*Find me again...* 

*The Dream Peddler"* 

"Silly foreigners", I flung the letter away and scurried upstairs like a little school boy.
