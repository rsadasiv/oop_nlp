It seems like only yesterday when I used to crawl into my mother's lap for comfort in distress. Being a single parent she has been the strongest pillar of my life, I do not know how to express my gratitude towards her if through anyway she accepts. She chose to give me birth against everyone's wishes. It wasn't easy when everyone questioned her about the father of the infant but she remained silent. I wonder sometimes, 'Was I all worth her pain?' and I think she answers it every day through a smile. She was there to kiss my tears after my first breakup, to share the pillow after a nightmare, to stir a coffee in the midnight for a company and to wave goodbye until I disappeared from her sight.

I can see her smile while she chops the spinach on the dining table and it is the same smile, which she gave after my recruitment as a professor in Hindu college. I shift my gaze to an old photograph, which is pinned on the wall. In the picture, my mother is gently holding me from behind and I am seated on the chair flaunting a bright red dupatta, which presumably belongs to my mother. In my heart, I wish to relive those blissful days but my mind knows that time and tide waits for none.

Amidst, I sail back to reality with my phone soundly vibrating on the table. I swiped the lock screen and it shows a new message in the inbox. The screen displays a message from Ganesh, which says:  I am so excited to meet you. We will be there by 7 p.m.  When I was young, I used to dream of getting married with a young handsome man who would mount on a white horse and lead me towards the castle of love. Today when I have blossomed into an independent, mature and strong - minded woman, somehow I fear the aftermath of love, which is - marriage. To some extent, Ganesh possesses all the qualities of an ideal husband. He is patient, honest, respectful and supportive. Ganesh and I went to the same college and developed a strong connection with common interest in music. He approached me in a college musical fest, reciting the lyrics of 'You're beautiful' by James Blunt.  Of course, he gave me no choice to say no and that was how it became our favourite song. In these six years of relationship, he has been an ideal boyfriend for an opinionated woman like me. Honestly, I didn't know much about love earlier but now I seem to have found a synonym for it, which is acceptance.

My mind is galloping from the memories of past to the anxiety of the future. I hold my breath and take a glance at my mother who is now struggling to peel garlic with her fingertips. Her eyes are narrowed and her smile is straightened by now. I can sense her grief, fear and anxiety in those trembling fingers. She stirs the dish with a sinking heart and I know already that she has made the dish too salty.  I grab my phone to leave back a reply -  We are waiting for you… J



In the evening, my mother made a great fuss while choosing a sari for her. She would place a sari on her left shoulder and after an intent look on it - she threw it on the bed dejectedly. She chose a royal blue kanzeevaram sari with broad golden border on its edges, which I had gifted on her birthday. I watched her intently as she kohled her eyes and painted her lips deep red with her hair half curled and untied. My mother appeared to me young and exquisite with no mark of ageing and sadiety. She looked best with the curve on her lips. Amidst, I knew in the core of my heart that this smile was soon to fade.  I took a glance at my peacock green sari neatly placed on the hanger at the bedside. It was not that I didn't like traditional attires and it was extremely gorgeous with hand embroidery. However, I wasn't ready to wear it. I took out a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt from the almirah and laid them on the bed. I was ready for my mother's reaction but I knew she would understand.   I saw rolling her eyes on me.  I told her that I was more comfortable on it and that I was not married yet. I wore the same pair of jeans and white t-shirt on which was written 'I AM SEXY AND I KNOW IT' with black bold letters. My mother heaved a sigh when she read the caption on my t-shirt but was content when I agreed to leave my hair loose. She pleaded me to apply a light shade of lipstick to brighten my lips but her request went vain.

Ganesh lived in the 24 North City apartment, which was about 5 kilometers away from my residential address. My heart was fluttering with joy as the bliss of love was on my way. Ganesh once mentioned to me that his parents are orthodox in nature but are good from heart. He never spoke to his parents about our relationship and I never forced him to do so. We both needed time and patience for the time being.  I was euphoric as like any soon-to-be bride would be in my place. I couldn't stop humming 'You're Beautiful' song, which was playing on a loop. I lighted the scented candles in the four corners of the room and placed fresh jasmine flowers in the vase. A fresh aroma of spices filled the room, which came directly from the kitchen.

 When I heard the doorbell, I skipped a heartbeat and paced fast to open the door. If I had not been so excited and walked gently towards the door, I would not have tripped over a carpet. When I pulled the door open, I saw Aarav and his parents standing. We greeted each other with Namaste and led them to the drawing room.   Ganesh's mother was a woman with poise and enticing personality. I noticed that she would enlarge her eyes while talking and smile often as our eyes met. At first, she appreciated the interior design of our home. She told me that she was an avid reader by looking at the bookcase neatly stocked with paperbacks. Meanwhile, my mother brought a jug of mango juice, which I started pouring into the glasses. It was very unusual but my hand started trembling when I filled the second glass for uncle. 'Careful,' he said in a firm voice and it was when I spilled the liquid on the surface. I looked at my mother like a helpless child and she smiled waving her hands in the air. Ganesh took an intiative to fill his own glass while I walked back to my seat.  'Ganesh told me that you're a professor of Hindu college?' aunty asked.  'Yes aunty,' I said smiling at her.  'Do you like your job?' uncle said while shifting his glance from family pictures on the wall.  'Of course Sir, I always wanted to teach. I am content with my profession,' I replied and calling him 'sir' was what they call a reflex action.  Ganesh who was draped in a royal blue suit and a white shirt didn't shift his gaze from me to anything or anyone. And honestly, it was he who made me nervous much of the time. He didn't speak much but I couldn't resist admiring him a little more when he held my mother's arm and sat close by her side.  I felt more comfortable while talking to aunty because her smile was soothing. She appreciated me for my work and appeared quite impressed with me. But I wasn't still sure with uncle, his moustache with twisted ends frightened me but I couldn't wait to make fun of it with Ganesh. I would tell him that his father was like a grumpy alien.  'Do you always wear western attires?' uncle asked, this time frowning.  'Yes uncle, I am more comfortable in it,' I replied smiling but hesitating to make an eye contact. He didn't say anything but shifted his glance on aunty. Suddenly, the room was filled with strange silence, which was broken by the whistle of a pressure cooker. My mother went to set the food on table and I quietly followed her. I placed the dishes on the table whose aroma had by now, reached our neighbor's door. The sight of a bowl of biryani and chicken curry stuffed in a cauldron was mouth watering. We all started munching the food together with delight. Ganesh's father slipped a spoon from his finger and that was when I chuckled but instantly regretted. 'The food is so delicious. I loved it,' Ganesh said running his hand over his stomach. Aunty insisted to share the recipe with her, which I did. My mother went to the kitchen to bring the desert for us.  'Maya, I really like you and your mother. It is a difficult task to find a good woman like you in this generation. So I am willing to make you my son's bride, I hope your mother has no objection,' aunty said by taking my hand on hers.  My mother had already heard what she had said. She motioned and tried to utter a word, which I translated to others that she had no objection. My mother's eyes were glittering in tears as Ganesh comforted her.  'Aunty, I have something more to say…' I said.  'Yes, tell me, what is it?' she said in a calm voice.  'Aunty, my father abandoned my mother when I was in her womb. She was fooled in the name of love; I hope Ganesh has already told you about this. My mother who cannot utter a word fought this society with no voice. She has been the strongest pillar of support in my life, the thought of leaving her is heart wrenching. She could disown me as she had the choice but she chose to give me birth.  'Aunty, I have a small request to make and if you can grant me this wish, I will do everything as you say. My wish is that, I want Ganesh to stay with me after our marriage,' my voice quivered as I said the last word.  Everyone in the room including my mother was silent.  'Maya, I can understand but it is against the tradition,' aunty reprimanded.  'Aunty, I cannot change the tradition and I personally do not care for society…'  'But we do...' Uncle said with a strong voice widening his eyeballs. My mother motioned me to be silent but I could not remain calm.  'Ganesh, are you willing to stay with me after marriage?' I asked feeling dejected.  He looked at his mother and ran his finger over his hair as if struggling to make any decision.  'Maya, I can't leave my parents. They are dependent on me and being an only son in the family, I have my responsibilities. But I promise you, I will treat your mother as my own and she will be my equal responsibility after marriage. I promise you, he said.  'You can't leave your parents but you expect me to leave my mother who has nobody except me. Your mother has her husband and a family to look after her. How on earth can you imagine leaving my mother for the sake of tradition and gender-biased social norms?' I said with my voice quivering in anger.  Uncle leaned forward to say something but I waved him to be silent.  'Thank you so much for coming but I think it is too late now for any discussion,' I stood to guide them towards the doorway. My mother made incessant hand movements to everyone but none could understand her gestures except me. I translated her gestures by saying she was glad to meet them.  'Maya, you cannot change the tradition for love. Please understand…' Ganesh held my hand and broke down in tears. 'I love you Maya, please don't do this,' he pleaded.

'I know; we cannot change the tradition but can challenge it.'

Honestly, it was the most unpleasant sight to watch the love of my life walk away. I closed the door, the same door, which I had opened few hours ago with so much excitement. If Ganesh was the channel of love, my mother was my life. It wasn't easy to choose one between the two. But I knew life was greater than love when I felt a warm hand gripping my shoulder.
