*Wrecked* 

Proteem Bhaduri 

Jim died on the fifth day but we didn't eat him till the seventh. 

None of that was in the plan, of course. 

The plan had been a three-day retreat at Koh Phayam, one of Thailand's few remaining islands that haven't been entirely devoured by the maw of tourism and commercialization; where the beach is still pristine and tranquility is still a thing. It's between a forty-minute to a ninety-minute journey from the pier at Ranong, depending on the kind of boat you are in.  Our budget allowed for a shared, single-engine open motorboat - mostly wooden, slightly creaky -- that should have made the trip in an hour tops. Besides the native pilot and his helper, there were six of us passengers on-board. With me, there was Jim, my buddy of eight years from college, Cassandra, a feisty brunette I'd started dating about two months ago, and Blakely ( 'Bear' to most people who knew him - not the most imaginative reference to his huge and shaggy built), Jim's friend and partner in their Motorbike customization shop back home in Wisconsin. We'd all arrived in Thailand for a long-overdue vacation, and after sampling the exotic pleasures of Bangkok for a week, had planned this mellower move. The other two passengers were a married couple from India - Nitin and Kavya; also there on holiday and also looking for a quieter destination. 

When we left Ranong, the sea looked placid, playful, and vast as always; the boat churning white foam from its deep blue as it cut across. The skies above seemed marginally overcast, with pregnant clouds waddling about in gray maternity smocks. But it wasn't cause for concern, we were told by our affable pilot, Andy Aromdee, in the broken but lyrical English common to the country.  He said it was probably raining in the distance but by the time it caught up to us, we'd have docked in Koh Phayam. 

We were zipping along at a decent rate and I was enjoying the wind tossing my longish hair.  I was leaning over the side and making creases in the water with my fingers. Cassie and Bear had engaged the two young Indians in conversation. Bear was showing off his tattoos and his latest, prized acquisition from Bangkok's floating market; a hunting knife with an eight-inch serrated blade and an intricately filigreed hilt, and the engraved faux-leather scabbard that came with it. Cassie usually wasn't a fan of Bear - she found him loud and boorish - but she seemed to be enjoying herself at the moment. Jim was being the quiet, thoughtful Jim I'd always known; staring away into the distance. I was about to go over to him and snap him out of whatever reverie he was nursing, when the rain came down. 

It didn't arrive in a gentle drizzle that gradually intensified; it all-out *poured*; suddenly and furiously. It struck us with the ferocity of bee stings and brought angry winds in tow. We were all drenched to the skin in seconds. Bear, Cassie and the Indian couple were desperately trying to unfold a tarp that lay on deck, to cover themselves with. Andy, the pilot, was shouting something in Thai to his helper, while trying to steady the exaggerated rocking of the boat. The helper shouted back something equally incomprehensible and gestured wildly back the way we came from. Jim stood frozen; his slight frame buffeted by the raging winds. And as for me, I just looked at the sea, and listened to it. 

The sea roared. It made a sound that made me think of rumblings in a hungry dragon's stomach, of whales rolling on the ocean floor, of a cavalry charging us. The gently rippling waves of just minutes ago had transformed into a giant swell that reared up like a skittish horse; it ate the sky and then fell on us. 

I remember holding my palm up to the wave as it descended. I remember thinking that would do about as much good as holding up a handkerchief to shield myself from an oncoming train. I remember the weight of the three-fourths of the world that is water descending on me, and the surface below my feet splintering, disintegrating.  Then there was darkness. 

The next thing I remembered was waking up half-on and half-off some kind of a hard surface, with the waves slapping my behind with urgency. My left arm was clasped around something long and wooden.  My eyes were open but all around me, it was still very dark, and still pouring. 

I dragged myself out of the water; onto the rocky shelter I was leaning on, pulling the wooden thing in my arm behind me. My head still felt like it was swimming. Not too far away, I could hear loud moaning, and someone else screaming for help. The voices sounded familiar. I wanted to holler back, but it seemed like too much work. I slept instead. 

The next time I came to, it was day and it had stopped raining. My body felt like it had been wrung in a washing machine but my head felt a little clearer. There was a deep, throbbing pain in my left leg. The leg was swollen, but I couldn't feel a fracture, maybe it was a torn ligament. I managed to get up and take a few steps though, keeping most of my weight on my right foot. 

I was on a huge, black rock; flat at its outer-edge and with a gentle incline at its centre, high enough to mask the view to the other side. All around it I could see nothing but unending, unbroken expanse of the Andaman Sea. It was like a mini-island, but one made entirely of stone and with no vegetation or greens of any kind. It was a dead rock; black as coal, except at its lower periphery where the waves left behind a greenish, mossy imprint. 

Next to me lay the piece of wood I'd been holding onto; it was a splintered, broken-off section of the boat's deck, a couple of feet long.  There was a box-like protrusion in its side, with a latch that was surprisingly still in place. I unclasped it and the lid fell open; to reveal three things: A waterproof first-aid kit, a bright orange flare gun and two orange-cased flares next to it. 

I checked the medical kit first. There were various lengths of bandages, gauze, antiseptic and after-bite wipes, anti-histamines, an antibiotic ointment, antacids and electrolyte pills, some Ibuprofen, safety pins, and two waterproof matchboxes. 

I dry-swallowed two painkillers before inspecting the flare gun. There was an instructions leaflet next to it but it seemed of a fairly straightforward, single-shot, load-and-shoot variety. I loaded a flare, locked it shut and then dropped the gun into one of the deep pockets of my still-dripping Cargo-pants, along with the remaining flare. The medical kit went into another pocket. 

The serendipity of having been marooned with a medical kit and a flare gun didn't escape me, but at that moment, it was cruel serendipity at best, because neither offered immediate succor. 

The thought of assistance reminded me of the moaning and yelling I vaguely remembered hearing. There wasn't a soul on my side of the rock so I hobbled my way over the incline. I saw them as soon as I was over the crest; Bear and Cassie; huddled together at the bottom, on the flat edge of the rock, both looking as wet and miserable as I felt. Beyond them, the sea stretched out as endlessly as it had on my side; no other land in sight. As I drew closer, they heard me and Cassie sprang to her feet with a squeal of surprise. She ran up and hugged me; tight enough that I worried about the stuff in my pockets poking her. She didn't seem to notice though, she was crying. I looked past her tangled and matted hair at Bear, who was waving at me wearily, from where he sat bare-chested, his massive breadth on display. His shirt hadn't made it past the swirling waves, but his knife had; its scabbard still hung proudly at his waist. 

Then I noticed what - or rather, who - they had been huddling over. 

Jim lay flat on his back; he wasn't moving and even from some distance away, I could hear him breathing in ragged, labored gasps. Lying there, with his wet shorts and tee clinging to him, he looked even frailer and smaller than he usually did. Or perhaps it was the growing pool of blood he lay in, or the long, twisted, metal shard sticking out of his midsection that made him look that way. Somewhere between being tossed around by the waves and landing on this rock, Jim had been impaled by a piece of the wreckage, and it was still stuck in his gut. 

The other two had held onto another floating fragment of the boat and had been swept onto the rock, just like me, except they landed on the other side. Barring a few ugly bruises, physically they both appeared okay; although Cassie still seemed in shock. They remembered seeing Andy go down just before they made ground. Of the other three on the boat, they had no idea and there was no sign. 

Our first concern at the moment was Jim, who had washed up on the rock - already drilled - just a few minutes after they had. He hadn't regained consciousness and they didn't dare try to move him. Neither did I, he was clearly hanging on by just a thread. None of us had pretensions of medical training but we'd all seen enough *Grey's Anatomy* and *ER* on TV to know that if we tried removing the shard, not only would he bleed out but most of his guts would also, likely, spill out with it. 

Really, there was little we could do for him. And whatever little we *did, *I suspect, was more to somewhat relieve our own helplessness than out of any real hope. I produced the medical kit and - after passing around some painkillers - we wrapped some gauze around his wound, hoping to staunch the bleeding. I even poured some antiseptic ointment on it. I don't think either helped. 

The next few days passed in a blur. 

We sat around hoping to see help appear on the horizon, but the sea rolled on, undisturbed and uncaring. No boats appeared, no airplanes passed over us. It seemed likely that by then people were out looking for us, but whatever desolate stretch of the sea we were in was proving elusive. 

It rained sporadically each day, which was good, because it filled the small cracks and crevices in the rock with fresh water, and so we weren't thirsty. But we were getting hungry. 

We sat around hoping - unrealistically - Jim would make a miraculous recovery, but he only got worse. By now, he'd started regaining consciousness for brief periods; moaning and babbling incoherently when he did. I tried feeding him painkillers but they made no difference. By the fourth night of these sudden, shrill outbursts, we were hoping he'd just stay unconscious...and slip away, quietly. Meanwhile we were getting hungrier. 

It's not like we didn't try finding food, but when I said earlier the rock was dead, I wasn't exaggerating. *Nothing* grew on it and nothing alive came near it. No animals or birds, no insects, and no sea life. Both Bear and me thrashed around in the water near it for hours hoping to catch something - Bear stabbing the water with his knife like it was a wild beast - but, in vain. The only thing the sea gave us was huge deposits of kelp, every so often when the waves slapped the rock's surface. We even tried eating that; the first bite was vaguely fishy, the second so bitter that we were gagging and throwing up bile in seconds. But at least, once it dried, it burnt. And because the matchboxes actually *were *waterproof, every night we had a little fire; to keep us warm and to signal any passing boats, which never came. We also burnt the misshapen wooden planks we'd floated in on, but the kelp was much easier to light, and it kept coming, even after the wood was long gone. 

On the fifth evening, we found Jim dead. By then, we didn't really care; we were half-dead from hunger ourselves.  My stomach felt like it had shrunk to the size of a peanut; there was a twisted knot in there that triggered spasms of acute pain every few minutes. My head felt swimmy and my vision was blurred. My feet refused to carry me. We'd all experienced bouts of extreme nausea and diarrhea, but by now there seemed nothing left to expel. The others looked as bad as I felt, their skin was stretched and gray and their eyes had shrunk into their drawn faces. We weren't talking much either, words felt heavy. 

Right about then, dying didn't seem that bad of a thing. 

It was two days later, when we were sprawled around a kelp fire, staring hopelessly at the unblinking sea, when Cassie muttered something about releasing Jim's body into the water. Surprisingly, it hadn't started stinking yet, or showing any visible signs of decay, maybe because of the salty air, or the lack of insects, I don't know. In any case, I felt too weak to even consider moving it, so I just kept quiet. Bear, however, reacted. He struggled to his feet unsteadily, looked at the body with glazed eyes, and said, ''Fuck it.'' His dry lips popped with a farting sound when he spoke. 

We watched as he shuffled towards the body, thinking maybe he would drop it over the side. Instead, before we could really process what was happening, his knife was in his hand and he'd cut out a big chunk of flesh from Jim's modest ass. He skinned it, speared it with the knife and stuck it over the fire. 

I think it was only when the flesh started browning and crackling, and we smelt its charred whiff that our dulled senses truly understood what Bear was doing. A strangled, ''No!'' erupted from Cassie and I waved weakly at him with a, ''You can't do that to him, man.'' 

Bear ignored us, and when the flesh looked brown enough to him, he bit off a big morsel. He chewed heavily, considered the taste, and then pronounced, ''I've had worse.''  He bit off another steaming chunk before handing the knife - with a piece of Jim at its end - to me. 

I swear if I hadn't felt like I was dying of hunger, I wouldn't have done it. If I had been thinking clearly, I wouldn't have done it. But there was this desperate, unreasonable *need* in my stomach, and it had opened its mouth wide, unwilling to be denied.  So, I took it, and chomped hungrily. It was tough, burnt, and I think there was still some hair left on it, but it was food. I expected to gag after the first swallow, but I didn't. After two bites, it tasted vaguely like pork. Wordlessly, I passed the remainder to Cassie. She cried while she ate, and between bites, she kept muttering, ''I can't eat this, this is too gross.'' She finished the rest and then Bear sliced a fresh chunk. 

That night we gobbled up most of Jim in gluttonous, guilty, enormous mouthfuls. None of us got sick from eating him. We slowed down over the next few days and rationed what was left. But by the tenth night, he was all gone, barring the bones and entrails. We gave those to the sea. 

Then the search for food and rescue began all over again, by rote. We splashed about in the water for fish. We lit fires every night for rescue. The days passed, we found neither. But the hunger came back, sooner than we expected, and as demanding as before. At least the rain kept up with our thirst, but the water just seemed to make us hungrier. 

By then, the days and nights had congealed into a dreary, hopeless sameness so I'm not sure exactly when Cassie came up to me, but it was when the hunger pangs were getting unbearable. With our hopes of survival dimming, the conversation had faded even further, and we had taken to manning separate sides of the rock, to give us a greater chance of spotting elusive rescue. At first it was only Bear but later Cassie had moved to a different side too. In any case, the time when we were actually *sleeping *together seemed a world away now. The sea had driven a wedge in our blooming romance - and, really, it didn't feel so bad. 

We all only saw each other when scavenging seaweed for fires, or splashing around in the futile search for food. And we were okay with that; each other's faces were just a reminder of the hopelessness. So, I was a little surprised when Cassie crossed over to my side one evening and spoke in hushed tones, without preamble, ''Bear is losing it, Mike. He's got this mad glint in his eyes and he keeps muttering, 'I need to eat, I need to eat, someone's going to feed me', and sharpening that blade of his. He's gonna take you out, and then me, and make a meal of us; soon. I can feel it, man. Unless *we *take him out first. Look, we're not gonna last much longer without food anyway, man. So, if it's down to us *becoming* food, or hunting food, I say we hunt.'' 

She paused to take a breath, her jaw jutting out defensively, like she thought I'd need more convincing. I think I surprised both of us by simply replying, ''Okay, so when?'' The thing is, she was right; we *did* need to eat desperately. And I had noticed Bear getting wound up too; staring at me strangely and practicing knife strokes. And If it had to be done, we stood a far better chance against him together. 

She looked relieved. ''Let's not give him a chance to make his move. Let's sneak up on him tonight, He'll doze off for a bit, and you know he's a heavy sleeper.'' 

She retrieved something stuck down the back of her pants; it was the metal shard that had penetrated and killed Jim. In a pinch, it would make a good slashing tool. 

I looked around. The rock island had a mostly smooth surface, but the relentless pounding of the waves had dislodged some stones. I found one big enough to occupy my palm. 

We were as prepared as we could get. Although, if Bear were alert and ready, I didn't think we stood a chance, even with our makeshift weapons. Catching him asleep or off-guard was the only plan. 

We separated then, not wanting to cause Bear any suspicion. From Cassie's usual position on the rock, she could see Bear, at his. And so, later that night, she came back to me, whispering that he had dozed off. A fat moon sat above; the rock bathed in its radiance, making our tiny kelp fires seem insignificant.  We crawled up the incline towards Bear's side, 'weapons' in hand. The pain in my leg had eased but I still had a slight limp that made even the gentle climb a labored one. 

As I got to the peak of the incline, I could hear Cassie breathing heavily right behind me. From there I could see Bear's fire dancing at the bottom, where the slope flattened out. But I didn't see Bear. 

That's when I felt a hard whack to the back of my knees. I fell back - the rock popping out of my hand - and rolled past Cassie, who had struck me with her piece of metal. As I landed back on flat ground, and got my bearings, I saw Bear standing above me, knife glinting in the moonlight. He hadn't been asleep; he had crept around the incline and behind us - behind *me*, really, because, of course, Cassie knew all along. She walked down to stand beside Bear and spoke to me in a flat, unimpassioned voice. ''I had to do it, Mike. You've got to see that. I mean, look at him; even without that knife of his, you didn't stand a chance, man. He's *that* big! And you can't even walk straight. He'd have taken you out anyway. And If I hadn't helped, I'd be next. At least, this way, I get to eat too. I had to do it. And he'll make it quick, he promised me that.'' 

Surprisingly, there were tears rolling down her cheeks as she made her - seemingly rehearsed - confession, but they didn't seem to weaken her resolve to make a meal of me, or Bear's. 

I didn't say anything. I wasn't feeling much of anything either, except for the aggravated throb of pain in my leg. Certainly not betrayed; ever since we'd eaten Jim, everything had felt unreal, and this seemed about par for the course. But, I suddenly realized, I wasn't feeling quite ready to die either. 

Bear stepped closer, looming over me, knife raised. ''Let's get this over with, Mike. I'll do it clean, so you don't suffer --'' 

He stopped midsentence because a *whoosh *drowned him out, and suddenly, there was a gaping, flaming hole in his chest, as the flare shot right through him and then made a grand pyrotechnical display over the sea - at 16,000 candlepower, if the instructions manual was accurate. Bear clutched at the orange void in his chest, with a look of almost comical surprise, and then toppled over, inert. 

I don't remember if I had ever mentioned the flare gun to the other two; if I had, they had probably forgotten about it. Honestly, with no reason to use if for all those days, I hadn't thought about it myself. But it poked my leg when I took the tumble, and it came out of my pocket cleanly when I yanked at it, and it fired true, despite all the drenching it had taken in the rains. 

While Bear fell and the sky lit up, Cassie stood frozen in shock. I didn't know what her next move would be, but I didn't plan on waiting for it unarmed. I quickly patted my pocket for the other flare, it wasn't there. I must have knocked it out while clearing the gun. I looked down and there it was; its bright orange at sharp contrast with the slate rock in the moonlight. I grabbed it, reloaded in one quick motion, and was on my knees, gun pointed in the general direction of Cassie. 

She hadn't moved, except to pick up Bear's fallen knife. Now the metal shard was shoved down the back of her pants again, and the knife was in her hand. From the way she hefted it firmly, she looked like she knew a thing or two about using it. I remembered she had grown up in Louisiana, and had gutted and carved many a deer and rabbit that her brothers and father brought back from hunting trips. 

We just stared at each other for a moment, wordless, with Bear's still-sizzling body lying between us like a giant punctuation mark. Then she bent to check him for a heartbeat, and finally spoke. 

''He's a goner,'' she confirmed. '' Neat trick with the flare, Mike, I didn't even remember you *had* that gun on you. But it's over now, right? He's dead, you win, and we have no reason to fight. The only reason I was helping him was for food, and now we both got food. He *is *food. Look, I *get *you're still pissed at me; we don't need to be in each other's faces if you don't want. We can just cut out our share of him, and stay on different sides of the island - like we were before. Look how big he is, he'll feed us for days. And after that...I don't know, we'll just keep hoping, I guess. But my point is, we don't need to fight here and now, Mike. If we do, we could both come out losers. I mean, from the looks of it, you've only got the one flare left, and you're not gonna take me by surprise like you did Bear. So maybe you get me, or maybe I dodge it completely, or it just grazes me. And then, it's you with your crap leg against me and the knife, and I'm pretty good with it. So, we could both end up dead, or hurt bad. And we don't need to, right now. So, what do you say? Can we just split the spoils and walk away?'' 

Again, she was right. And honestly, I was feeling more numb then pissed. And my leg was hurting like a bitch. I didn't even feel like talking, leave alone fighting. I stuffed the gun back in my pocket, grunted my assent, and gestured at the body to indicate I wanted the half without the tattoos. 

She bent and started skinning him. 

Bear fed us a lot longer than Jim had; there was a lot more of him. Towards the end, I ran out of matchsticks, so there was no fire and I had to eat his last pieces raw. It didn't taste like sushi, but it wasn't rotting or decomposed either- again, maybe it was the air. Either way, it was food. 

Cassie ran out of matchsticks too. I know because she came over to my side to ask if I could spare any (by then I didn't have any to give). So, neither of us now has fire. She ran out of her share of Bear too; I saw her dumping the last of his picked-clean bones into the sea. 

But that was many days ago - I've lost track of how many. Now, that burning, insistent pang in the belly is back - a void screaming to be filled. I'm sure it's no different for Cassie; I've seen her lurking around at the top of the incline, looking haggard, but keeping a sharp eye on me. I think we both sleep with an eye open, minding the shadows, constantly wondering when the other will give in to their hunger and strike, breaking the uneasy truce. I know *I've* been thinking about doing it, thinking often. 

But all that changed tonight, five minutes ago, when I saw something. 

I saw faint lights, floating deep in the distance, where the brooding, dark sky meets the restless sea. They seemed brightened by the blackness around them. 

It could just be a hunger-induced hallucination, but I don't think so. I can still see them, but they're moving further away; soon they'll be lost. If it is what I think - and desperately hope - it is, then I need to use my flare right away. If it really is a boat - *and *if it sees the flare - then this nightmare could finally be over. If not, I'll just lose my only weapon against Cassie and her big knife. 

I can hear scrambling sounds behind me, from the cliff, but I don't dare tear my eyes off the lights. It's probably Cassie; maybe she's seen the lights too, or maybe she's preparing to jump me. 

The lights are growing fainter. I need to decide now. 

I take the gun out, hold it up and turn around.
