*‘An Almost-Rape Story’ by Mohit Parikh * 

*(Based on true events)* 

I just wanted to cash in on the Delhi gang rape case of 2012. 

The whole country it seemed was angry and vociferous and out on the street lighting candles. Awakened, as news had channels put it. And I thought nothing better if I could ride along this wave, if I could compose a story that would capture the nation’s imagination. Deadline for the Fifteenth National Short Story Award was nearing and I fancied it as my last chance – or my last big chance – to make it into the literary world. 

I was a desperate writer, sort of. I was aspiring. I had written several short stories on transcendental *parahuman* experiences and most of them rested in my proverbial drawer. Some did make it to popular “lit magazines” but were received poorly by their readers who, as such, were fed on a steady diet of sentimental and pulp fiction. For reasons not too different, most editors and agents had formed a unanimous opinion on my unpublished debut novel, that it was unpublishable. Those who got back to me said it was hallucinating in parts but not human or humane enough, not relatable. Some joked that it was *paraliterary.* A sympathetic writer friend who had tasted moderate success by publishing erotica on Amazon.com said that I was much ahead of my times and should try to connect with the audience of this era first. I carried no illusions of my genius and I absolutely abhorred the zeitgeist-type authors like him. I could still see some sense in his suggestion however. I declared in a moment of frenzy that my entry for the Fifteenth National Short Story Award would be my make-or-break work. I will give them what they want like they never had it. 

That it was not easy to write about love and death and marriage I learned quickly. None of the three things had happened to me but these were the three things that happened to most people most of the time. All the ideas that came to my mind were either derivative or plain stale. I could easily recall a story, sometimes a whole novel, grown out of those very kernels. Not that I had to be completely original - rarely an author ever is - but I reckoned if the story was going to be my one final statement to the country’s literary coterie that is the august jury of this competition, I must strive to make this statement an unforgettable one. 

I read all the winning stories of the last fifteen years and found that they were journalistic without exception. At times repulsively moral or self-righteous, as the people of my country were, at times equivocal and investigative, but always journalistic. To tailor-design my entry I scanned a month’s newspaper and cut the most shocking or incredible piece of news that I could find. I wasn’t too surprised to see that about eight out of ten such cuttings were about rapes. In the aftermath of the Delhi gang rape case, it was as if an obscure tenet was now realized: that rapes happened in my country, that they were severe, despicable crimes, and that something had to be done about them, they were not supposed to be read and overlooked as mere pieces of news. This new found sensitivity in Indian patriarchs - I’d had to be blind and brainless for this to escape. 

In the likeness of all the writer protagonists in all the stories about writing you ever read, I found penning down a story difficult still. Difficult because there was no wisdom in writing *an* *ultimate rape story* (that’s what I was calling it). Things are much too predictable plot wise – start anywhere it is not hard to guess where the story is going. Additionally, the details - the journalistically real details on which I was banking – those details had already become banal. After the extensive, almost exhaustive, coverage on rapes by fledging to eminent newsmen (everybody had jumped on this opportunity to give their career a push) there was hardly any detail left out for imagination. Besides, it was obvious there was nothing I could write that would shake people more than what had happened in Delhi. 

I had almost given up on the idea of submission when one day I chanced upon a feisty open column in The Hindu by a Delhi University student. The article was on a girl’s perils of travelling alone in India. There was nothing remarkable about her contentions – which were the same old a-woman-in-a-men’s-world jazz – or in the account of her “traumatic” personal experience, but it was her picture that got my attention. She was fat and exhibited cleavage, even in the black and white passport sized photograph. And I hadn’t got laid in over six months. I immediately googled her name, dug out her email address and wrote a long polite email, letting her know of my writing credentials and my plans to fictionalize the events in her article. In the post script I asked if she was an NCR resident and, if so, was there a chance for a brief interview. 

I received her response two weeks later. She said she was extremely sorry for the extremely late reply, that my email had somehow ended in her spam-box, and that we could meet whenever it suited me. She asked me to respond at another email address, the one she used more frequently. We exchanged two-three formal emails and decided to meet the next Sunday morning. 

My dislike for her was - as they put it - instinctive. Sure, she looked better than in the picture, fairer at least, and she wasn’t as feisty as I was presuming her to be, but she was much too childish, even for her age, debarred from the experiences of real world. Add to that the fact that she liked blaming the world for her personal problems, which sounded impersonal and global when she voiced them (she blamed McDonald’s and neo-liberal capitalism for her weight problems, a right-winged national political party for her lack of interest in college curriculum, mainstream Hindi cinema for her father’s overbearing nature and so on and so forth). All the astuteness I had noticed in the article was bookish. I congratulated her on the publication of her excellent article, sympathized with her on the issues she raised, and let her do the talking. She was nine years younger to me and I had to justify my intentions of getting into her pants by listening to her soliloquy. I was still unsure if I would write any story based on her experience, my primary intentions were primeval. Anyhow, here’s how things unfolded in her long narrative (disclaimer: they unfolded at a snail’s pace): 

-          She goes to a hill station, all by herself for the first time. In fact, this is the first time she is going anywhere outside New Delhi without the company of her parents. After months of planning and indecision, and a long confrontation with her father, she has chosen to spend a long weekend at a small town in Uttaranchal, which isn’t a typical touristy spot and can only be reached by an overnight’s bus journey from New Delhi (there are no direct trains to that place). 

-          -Obviously, the minute after she boards the bus she is constantly bugged by phone calls. Her father lets her know that that if she feels nauseous or funny in the stomach, as all those who are not used to hilly roads do, she shouldn’t mind vomiting from the bus window or asking the conductor to halt the bus. In the side pocket of her purse, along with coins and medicines, are orange flavoured candies. She can suck on them to keep her mouth salivary and to pass her time. 

-          - Early next morning, she reaches the hotel recommended in a Swedish couple’s blog post. She takes the same room they had posted pictures of. 

-          - She has never been happier. The room has a spectacular view of a chaste valley, a hum of an unsighted rivulet flowing nearby, and the air smells of spring and freedom. This is life, she thinks. She writes a meditative verse. She evens hums an old Bollywood song. 

-          - Day 1, Morning-Evening: She takes a sightseeing tour in the hotel’s taxi. She shops, takes pictures, uploads the pictures on Facebook, and has a good time overall. For lunch she tries a local dish at an eating-joint-cum-residence run by an old woman and her daughter. It is an exotic experience. 

-          - Day 1, Late Evening: She returns dead tired. The surprisingly young hotel manager asks her about her plans for tomorrow. He suggests skipping the lakes and proposes instead a visit to the Tibetan monastery uphill. Two hour’s perilous drive but worth it. Briefly she talks about the day’s trip, about the early signs of commercialization visible in the town, about this fruit she ate at a grocery store, and retires to bed, skipping dinner. 

-          - Day 2, Morning-Evening: She is enthralled by the culture of the small Tibetan settlement. The monastery’s political and spiritual history gives her an exciting idea for the final year dissertation. Much of her day passes in frolic: she shops, climbs a yak, eats apples in a private orchard, clicks pictures of and with school going mountain kids, converses with Western tourists and volunteers, takes a horse ride to a sunset point and watches the sun set behind a snow-capped peak through telescopic binoculars. Phone calls from her parents have declined to a breathable three times a day. 

-          - Day 2, Late Evening: She asks the hotel manager to make a bill receipt. She will leave by the morning bus for a water-rafting base camp and from there for her home the day after. They chat again and it turns out that the surprisingly young hotel manager, who is also the only son of the hotel owner, has interned under her favourite college professor! In fact, he has been to her college several times - he remembers being enamoured by that little garden behind the Central Library. She informs him that that’s the most popular make-out point, and yes, it is her favourite place as well. Their conversation grows long and exciting. It is uncanny how much they have in common: Woody Allen and Ryan Gosling; Joan Baez and Faiz Ahmed Faiz; a strong disapproval for Indian government’s policies in Kashmir; Vienna as the one place they want to see before they die; a guilty love for spicy Thai cuisines. The hotel manager confides to her his plans of leaving the hotel business at thirty and moving to Mumbai to dedicate his life to art, and she encourages him to stick to them. Finally, exhausted, they call it a night. 

Having known the rest of the story from the newspaper, I got bored. I understood the need of a strong build-up for successful denouement of a suspense-thriller (the events of her trip in my head were always suspense-thriller visually), but not passing over on any single superfluous detail is just bad storytelling. I finished my cup of coffee, ordered another, and gave signs of restlessness which she ignored or did not notice. It struck me later that it wasn’t she, but I, who was the story-teller; she was only a young girl in whose extra-ordinarily “traumatic” experience a writer was taking interest. She was here to help. She perhaps did not even possess the intentions of fornication (in that, I found later, I was wrong). I got through the rest of her tale, which thankfully picked up some pace and tension: 

-          At around 09:30pm (Day 2), the intercom in her room rings. Or it may have been ringing for some time and only now she notices, awakened by its noise. She finds the hotel manager on the other side. There is a serious billing mistake, he says. She thanks him for letting her know and says she would collect the money in the morning. 

-          Fifteen minutes later there is another call. The hotel manager insists she take the money now. She is a bit annoyed. She says there is nothing that can’t wait till the morning and she really wants to sleep. 

-          Within ten minutes there is a knock on the door. It is him. He softly calls her name a couple of times then calls her ma’am. She does not respond or switch-on the lights. He knocks the door once more before leaving her in peace. 

-          There are no more disturbances but she is wide-awake. She likes the idea of the manager, who is kind of cute, having hots for her. She would tell about it in exaggerated details to her friends. 

-          At 12:28am precisely, there is a call again from the hotel’s reception. It is him. Blabbering in an inaudible voice. She hangs the phone and detaches the intercom cable. 

-          At 12:40am, there is a call on her cell phone from an unknown number. She can tell from the first four digits that it is not a New Delhi number. 

-          Her cell phone rings again. She picks it up this time. It is the hotel manager, of course. He repeats that she must collect the cash now for the staff might be asleep when she leaves. When she expresses her disbelief at his frantic insistences, he discloses his love for her, just like that. She is the one, he says. She has dealt with such situations before in college; she uses the same tricks and tropes. Tells him that she is not his type, that he barely knows her and that she already has a boyfriend, and manoeuvres him into ending the call with a promise to talk about the whole thing in the morning. 

She wasn’t yet panicked, she stopped and said to me at this point. Stressed, yes, but not panicked. All she had to do was wait him out; in the morning he could not dare bother her. But things got creepier steadily. 

-          At around 1am, she hears footsteps outside her door. Someone tries to turn the knob and force open the door. This instantly horrifies her. The possibility of rape becomes real. 

-          An envelope is slipped into the room from under the door. Muffled sounds of footsteps are heard. Is the courier leaving? 

-          It’s past 2am. No sounds heard since the delivery of the envelope. She tiptoes to the door and flashes the cell phone light on the envelope. There is a folded notebook page - a hand written love letter, perhaps? - and some currency notes. 

-          She checks her cell phone which she had kept on silent. Besides twenty something missed calls from him, there are a number of text messages. Accusatory, guilt-ridden, love *shayaris*, Joan Baez quotes, messages asking if she had read the letter, and pleas to open the door and listen to him once. Knocks on the door again. He starts calling her name like a lost lover. He is drunk, very. She shouts, *fuck off* and *help! somebody please help! *Nobody comes to her rescue but the knocker leaves. 

-          Scared “shitless”, she decides to call her best friend, something she has been meaning to avoid. She wants to serve as a role model to her girl friends, to college going girls in general, to all girls who grow up in parental curfew, and calling someone for help was mission failure. From the bathroom, in a hushed tone she apprises her best friend of the situation. Her best friend is alarmed – she feeds her phone numbers of the nearest police station from internet – then reassures her, saying that she is awake with her till the morning and that the worst that was going to happen has happened. Since the battery in her phone is low, she cuts the call, promising to call back soon. 

-          Having gained some strength now, she strategizes. Her goal is clear: stay unharmed till sunrise. She would achieve this by a) not going out of the room and b) not allowing anybody inside. Desperate, her tormentor might try to break in through the front door, through the bathroom window or from the room windows. She locks the bathroom, manages to push the TV table in front of the door, curtains the window properly and double-checks if they are closed. Next, she ensures her bags are packed and that she is ready to escape at the slightest opportunity. She puts her phone on charge, cash inside her bra and in the front pocket of her purse. Now then, the situation may still get out of proportion - she did not want to think how or why - but she decides to collect evidence. She takes pictures of the untouched envelope, of the room, and records in her cell phone the current state of affairs in her hushed voice. She thinks if the guy dares to return, she would try to bring him to some confession and record it. She sits silently at the edge of the bed, a nail cutter knife her weapon at hand. 

-          At 02:50 am, 02:48:19 am to be precise, the young hotel manager comes for a final plea. He is sobbing, in fact, wailing. He cries *I love you!*  and *Nobody understands me but you! *When she engages him in conversation he reveals what is (to me) a predictable back story. The day she booked the hotel room over phone, the manager searched her on web, and read all her blogposts and articles in online journals, even her comments on random websites as many as he could find them. He says he had not yet seen any of her pictures but he was already madly, incurably in love. Here is a person who would understand him, he knew. He noted down her interests, things she liked or disliked, and educated himself. She is his saviour, he says (to me she said, notice the irony here, but both she and I couldn’t see that time that the irony went deeper). 

-          *Is this a way to express love*?, she cries. *Is this how you treat someone you claim to love? Do you realize you are tormenting me?* While the hotel manager is mired in ethical quandaries, she manages to get through to the hotel’s reception on intercom and threatens to call the police lest this guy be whisked off ASAP. 

-          His parents arrive half-an-hour later. They manage to calm down the now curious lodgers, who for some reason never intervened before, and carry away their semi-conscious son to an unoccupied room. The father comes back to tell her that this was a small, regular matter, that there was no need to create such a fuss. She chastises him, and delivers a big, loud sermon to everyone standing there. She cries all through the return journey. 

I did not make any moves that night. She was clearly upset by the memories. I could discern a tinge of terror in her eyes. I sympathized with her, stating often how hard it was to grow up as a girl in this world. I walked her to the nearest metro station and gave a hug. We met the next weekend and the next, and finally the sex happened in my apartment. For all the inexplicable contempt I had for her, I fucked her in the doggy-style, imagining myself to be the young hotel manager. 

I started writing her account, in her voice and in her words, true to the fact. Hers was by no means an almost-rape scenario, she wasn’t even touched, but the incident had changed things for her forever – she had to erase her online presence, change phone numbers. It became hard for her to trust people and harder to trust herself. In the hotel’s register she had entered her permanent address and she feared - her fear sometimes paranoiac - that the guy might be in New Delhi, following her. Several times I had noticed her turning her head unwittingly in public places to check who was around. I put all this down in the story and ended it by paraphrasing a cliché: stories end but life goes on. I admit this wasn’t the breakthrough story I was looking to submit, but after what had transpired on December 16, 2012 in Delhi I thought I was better off writing something so ordinary that it came out as authentic and archetypal. 

Our affair lasted a month and ended on a bitter note. She accused me of using her for sex and I retorted that it were her fami-nazi energies that attracted harassment. She left me for good and we never tried to contact each other. It was only after a year that we met again, in a literature festival where I was invited as a session moderator. I was beginning to make my name. My entry had not won the contest but it was an honourable mention, and, when it got reprinted in an anthology, it received positive critical attention. What did the trick was a small note I had added at the last minute: This story is based on true events. 

She approached me when I was having lunch by myself. She was friendly with me in a formal way, but sad and less pretty than I had last seen her. She told me that she has dropped out of college and joined a Vipassana Meditation centre, that in spirituality she finds way of life. I was in a long-term relationship and did not want to trigger things between us. I excused myself for a meeting and ended our short awkward conversation with a handshake. In half-jest I asked if she had heard from that young hotel manager again. She said: you’d be surprised to know, mister. 

Something in the way she replied shook me. 

As I walked on, I started considering the possibility of a sequel.
