*Spin *

As the curtains parted, I moved nervously in my seat, tightening my grip around Sunil’s hand. 

“Uma, our son’s made it big,” Sunil said. I could sense the pride in his voice. “Can’t believe Arjun’s on stage.” 

“Shh. I know you’re excited, but you’re being too loud.” 

In truth, I don’t know who was the more nervous among the two of us then – Arjun doing his first public performance, or I, watching him from the front row. He looked odd in those white body-hugging tights even though I had seen them back at his apartment too. Add to it the sequins on his sleeves and the short blue jacket. What was our boy up to? 

He turned his back to the audience. The music started playing. The title track of one of those recent Bond movies. Which one? Ah yes, Skyfall. As the vocals kicked in he extended his arms, turned and ran towards the audience. His legs extended much like the ballerinas I had seen on television. 

Around me, the audience applauded as Arjun leaped up, did a mid-air split and landed cleanly on his right foot. He made it seem as if he were doing it in slow motion, as if the laws of gravity were different for him. And with grace. Grace that would look good for a woman. Why would a man need to do this? 

I directed a sideways glance at Sunil. He seemed transfixed just like the majority of the audience. Meanwhile Arjun kept bouncing ridiculously off the floor, extending his arms and legs with what I had to admit was great control. All the movements I had seen on television, he did them with perfection. At least as much as my undiscerning eye could see. The twirls, the pirouettes, the splits, whatever other moves, he did them well. Clearly, the boy had put in great effort after his move to Bangalore in the last two years. That was my boy. If he was passionate about a certain thing, he would pursue it relentlessly. 

If only he had been passionate about something else. 

Now the music dropped its tempo. I inferred the act was coming to an end. Arjun sprang into another leap, and landed on the floor with a clean split, his chest heaving on his left knee. 

Sunil pulled his hand out of my clasp and joined in the thundering applause.

“This way please,” the usher directed us to the green room. We snaked our way through the crowd; I figured they must have been there to meet the other dancers. 

“There he is,” Sunil said pointing to Arjun, the excitement in his voice all too noticeable. 

“So, how was it?” Arjun asked when we caught up with him. 

Sunil wrapped him in an embrace. “Brilliant, simply brilliant. You were fantastic, son.” I saw a teardrop fall off his chin onto Arjun’s shoulder. 

“Ma?” 

“It was good,” I replied. “You were..” 

“Hey Arjun, awesome work man.” It was one of the other dancers who had performed that evening. “Let’s hang out at Arbor tonight. Most of the troupe are in.” 

“Sorry Rohit, tonight’s with my parents. They head back to Hubli tomorrow.” 

# 

“Ma, everything okay?” Arjun asked as he turned on the ignition. “You don’t usually take the back seat.” 

“Na, nothing. I’m just a little sleepy.” 

“Okay. You were saying something when Rohit bumped in earlier. Something about how I did tonight?” 

“I said you were quite good.” 

“Just quite good? Everything all right?” 

“Well, you did dance well. You never told us you were continuing ballet in Bangalore?” 

“I thought it would be a good surprise. And a nice way to get your honest reactions. But you don’t seem fine, Ma.” 

“She must be tired after the flight this morning,” Sunil said. “The airport is two hours away from the city.” 

“Ah yes,” Arjun nodded. “I know it’s quite a drag getting here. Anyway, let Ma relax.” 

Father and son began chatting about the city, its traffic and the deteriorating weather. Then I heard Arjun talk about his ballet troupe. There was a clear zing in his voice. He had always been an introvert growing up, soft spoken. I wondered when this aspect of his personality had changed. 

I had to talk to him, but this was not the best time. Maybe after dinner.

“So you guys leaving tomorrow?” Arjun asked me. “Would have been great if you stayed for the weekend. I’ve got another show on Saturday.” 

“There are things to be done back home,” I said. “Anyway, do you do any other form of dance too?” 

“Nope, just ballet. This is so much fun, I can’t imagine doing anything else.” 

This was going to be tough. “Arjun, can’t you do something else?” 

“Something else?” 

“Yes, as in try your hand at other dance forms. What the youngsters do these days – hiphop or crumping. I’ve seen them on those dance shows on TV.” 

“I did try some of those styles early on. None could hold my attention.” 

“And ballet did?” 

“Exactly. I sense there’s a problem here, is it?” 

“Yes. Now, how do I say this? Ballet is for girls. Those graceful arching movements. They all look good on women, beta.” 

“But Ma, even men do it. Our troupe is led by a man. Didn’t you hear the applause the crowd gave us tonight?” 

“That’s fine, but do you know what they were whispering in their seats? ‘Look at the sissies dance’ one of them commented.” 

I immediately realized I should not have said that. But it was too late. 

“I know they say nasty things,” he choked. “People have even asked me if I was gay. Why should we pay heed to any of those fools? They form just a tiny percentage of the audience. You can’t stop them, can you?” 

“And you still want to do this? It’s embarrassing. When I get back home, I won’t even be able to tell our folks what you do here. Can you imagine how they’ll ridicule you? And even us?” 

“Why should those people matter?” 

“Because we live among them. You don’t, but I do. Your father does. For our sake, you must stop this silly girlish ballet thing.” 

“So even you think it’s not manly, huh?” 

“There could be so many other things you could do. Take up some sport. Tennis, football, anything. Something more physical and athletic. Not this.” 

“Ballet also needs strength, athleticism and balance. Didn’t you see that on stage?” 

“Enough. Now don’t argue any further. You better stop performing with that troupe immediately.”

The next morning, Sunil and I left for Hubli. I knew Arjun would not really pay heed to my warning. The boy had always been a stubborn kid; would it be any different now that he was living independently in a big city? 

Weeks flew by. Every time I spoke to Arjun on the phone, our conversations were superficial. Whether he had had dinner, whether I had taken my medicines, whether I was going on my evening walks. We would tiptoe around his dance stories. I took special care to avoid any mention of it. Sunil would talk about it over dinner sometimes; I would nod and change the topic as soon as I saw the opportunity. 

Until one morning when Arjun called. I instinctively knew something was wrong. Mornings were generally busy practice hours for him. 

“What happened? ... How? When? ” Sunil fumbled on the phone. “Are you all alright? No, don’t stay back… Come here, right away… Yes, I’ll pick you at the airport.” 

His hands trembled as he hung up. “Arjun had a fall during practice. Right ankle’s broken. He’ll fly in tomorrow." 

At least now, he’ll stop that crazy thing, I thought.

Arjun walked in limping on a crutch, his ankle covered in a monstrous cast. Sunil helped him sit. 

“How long will it take to recover?” I asked. 

Arjun winced as he leaned back in his bed. “Around six weeks for the fracture to heal. Then three to four months till I can resume normal activity.” 

“Stay put here for that time,” I said, tousling his hair. “Eat well, and forget about Bangalore and ballet for now.” 

Arjun looked at me grumpily, but said nothing. Maybe the pain was too much. He lifted the pillow and pulled out a book from underneath it. Must have been one of his artsy books about dance. He stacked two pillows, propped himself against them and began reading. So this was how he would deal with our disagreements. By ignoring me. 

That was fine. Today was just the first day; I was sure he would fall in line in a few weeks. I hoped he would rekindle the interests he had when he was living with us. Maybe he’d start playing the guitar again. Or the keyboards. Both had been lying untouched in a corner of his room. 

The changes though turned out to be far more drastic. Even after the cast was taken off, he would stay in his room all day, only stepping out for some sunshine in the mornings. He never even touched the musical instruments. Mostly, he would stay buried in his books. Or surf the internet. Watching videos of dancers. No, he had not gotten over his obsession. 

Almost three months had now passed since he had started walking without any support. Even then, his behavior was getting more reclusive. I had to step in. 

“Till when will this go on?” I asked as I barged unannounced in his room one day. “It’s not too late; get back to your accounting books. I’ll ask Suresh to get you an interview in the bank he’s working at.” 

“Ma, I’ve walked away from that years ago. Am not going back. You might be worried about where I am heading, what our relatives will talk about. But trust me, I know what I’m doing.” 

“Do you? Then go ahead, do exactly what you want.” 

I walked out slamming the door behind me. I could not sleep that night, guilty about how I had dealt with the whole issue. He was recovering from a major injury after all. I should have allowed him time. How could our differences turn into such distances? Was there no reconciliation possible, some point where we could both walk halfway to? 

I decided I’d set it right in the morning. Sit him down, understand what he was going through. I woke up at 7 am, and walked to his room. 

“Arjun,” I knocked, “can we talk?” 

No answer. “Arjun?” Still no answer. 

I knew he had been an early riser those days, so I pushed open the door. The room was empty. No sign of his books or clothes either. 

I rushed to wake Sunil up. Hope this boy had not done something drastic. Just then my phone beeped. 

*Sorry Ma. Had to leave for the city without saying goodbye. I thought you would not have taken it well. Pa already knows I resume practice tomorrow. Wish me luck.* 

I dialed his number, not knowing what we would talk about. But we needed to talk, I was sure about that.
