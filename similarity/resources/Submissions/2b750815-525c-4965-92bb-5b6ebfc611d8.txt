It was not quite the Apocalypse we were expecting but the 21st century had devastated us in so many unimaginable and unexpected ways. The last few months of 2001 had changed the world. Forever. Those last few months had personally been bad for me. My girlfriend had disappeared. It all started with me not wanting to own a cellphone. "You're so damn unreachable!" she would say when sudden change-of-plans had to be conveyed to me. That was of course an exaggeration. There were phones everywhere. The one at my flat even had an answering machine. But she didn't like leaving messages. Because of Dhruv. Not because he was a sneaky flatmate. But because she felt she couldn't sneak in inappropriate stuff in her messages in case Dhruv heard them. For me Dhruv was the best flatmate one could ask for. I had no grudges, no complaints whatsoever against him. He was okay with her staying over. No nudge-nudge wink-wink whenever our lovemaking got too loud. A few times when we were all over the flat drinking and fornicating in different rooms he was sweet enough to stay over at his friend's.

On the evening of September 11, she called on the phone at my flat.

"Switch on the TV!!"

"Why? You haven't called in three weeks. What's up?"

"Just go and switch on the TV and watch the news..."

"But... but we haven't talked in so long... now you call and ask me to switch on the TV..."

"I'll talk later. There's been a bomb attack in New York. Gotta go. It's mad right now at the newsdesk. Bye."

 We didn't meet for another week. Or perhaps it was two. Our lives got sucked into the news story of our lifetime. Though there was not much for us to report on from Delhi. There was a lot of newsfeed coming from the US. All our stories were put on hold unless they were in some way related to 9/11. The film critic began researching movie trivia on terror and war. The books editor was sent on a hunt to smoke out writers and experts on the Middle East especially if they had in their writings warned about such an attack. Junior writers like us were put on research and copyediting work.

In this great tsunami of terror and news on terror, Sumita and I were flung in different directions. As if it was not the Twin Towers that had been blown away but our already stretchy relationship. As the year receded our relationship became as scarce as our bylines. I found myself single again. For that year-ender holidays I decided to go the hills. Someone at work had once suggested Landsdowne as a great place for finding ghosts. I liked the idea of bringing in the new year in such a place. Besides I had my own ghosts to find and exorcise.

We had started seeing each other around Holi. We'd met a friend's place at a pre-Holi bash. By the time we were introduced she had already had a few bhang pakoras without realising what they were made of. Later close to dinner time the bhang began to kick in. She whom I had found to be shy and reserved when we were introduced could now not stop talking. It seemed like wanted she tell me everything about herself in the shortest possible time. While everyone else was downstairs having dinner we found ourselves kissing madly on the terrace. It was groovy how the psychotropic batter had worked its way into our heads driving us nuts over each other just a few hours into our first hellos. The green pakoras had been a good beginning.

Landsdowne was full of mist and gloom in December. Or maybe it just seemed that way because of my state of mind. The hotel room looked out into a garbage dump. The food was awful. A wailing dog somewhere closeby made sleep impossible. I left for Delhi soon after 2002 was cheered in around a damp bonfire where a few Delhi families played tambola and drank blended whiskey.

9/11 dominated our lives and stories in the new year as well. Then as the year barely turned 2 months. Gujarat erupted into an orgy of violence. Once again all our stories began to emerge out of a single nerve centre. By March end I was assigned a story completely different from the violence-fuelled news cycle coming out of Gujarat. It was about the massage ads that appeared in popular dailies. My job was to find out whether these services were genuine or they were just a cover for flesh trade. I began to call up the numbers in the ads and enquire about the rates and the types of services on offer. "Anything you want!" I was told by many enthusiatic voices, "We have model-type, English speaking girls". This implied that sex was definitely on the menu.

In the course of researching this story. I met this girl, Rati. A voice on the phone had told me that she was a model-type girl who was very cooperative.

"You have one hour," she said when I opened the door for her. It was close to the evening rush hour and I was surprised how punctual she was. Her 6 pm meant 6 pm. She was dressed casually in blue jeans and a white top. She could've been a college girl. The only give away of her profession was probably the choice of colours she was wearing on her eyes and lips. That made me wonder if there was a rulebook for dressing for the world's oldest profession. One that said 'Thou shalt always wear loud make-up'.

Rati was barely seated when the doorbell rang. She looked at me alarmed.

"Don't worry. No one's coming," I said.

That didn't seem to convince her. At the door was someone looking for B 156. We were at B 155 but the last 5 on the door was smudged making it look like 156. I gave him the directions and came back to where Rati was sitting on the drawing room sofa.

"So? Should we go inside?"

"Yes but let's talk first," I said, "can I get you something to drink?"

"Vodka," she said even as she seemed surprised by my offer, "chhota peg, ice and water."

I poured her a small Vodka with water and ice. The first sip she took was generous. It seemed like she was used to the drink without any sugar spikes. I didn't know of many women who had their alcohol without fizzy drinks or fruits juices. But I guess Rati wasn't like the women I'd known.

"How did you come into this profession?" I asked adding, "You seem like a good girl."

"Kya good girl, boss," she laughed. "It's all kismat. I wanted to travel and see new places. And I loved to dance."

The look on my face probably said I don't get how your wanderlust and love of dance were connected to what you did for a living. She took a long pause. "I used to be in a dance troupe. We did shows in different cities. Then I saw some of the other girls really living it up. They had the best clothes and best shoes. You couldn't do that with what the troupe managers paid us. These girls got me into this business. And that's how I stopped dancing, but the travel and earning continue," she said with a wink.

"And then the money got you hooked?"

"Yes you could say that. I can afford a lot of things now that I couldn't before," she said caressing her gold Timex watch. "But don't think there are no risks involved. Our work is dangerous business."

"What kind of risks?"

"Just recently they took us to Ahmedabad..." she became quiet as if she had changed her mind about telling me the whole story.

"What happened in Ahmedabad?"

"You know with all the riots happening there we were still taking clients. It was business as usual," she shivered at the memory of that time. "These bastards took us there knowing how bad things were."

"Which people?"

"These fucking dalals. The pimps who take us to different cities." It was a cruel world of collateral damage we were living in. Especially in her line work. You could disappear without a trace. Who would come looking for a call girl from another city. She was a missing person to begin with. Rati was silent again.

"What happened in Ahmedabad?"

"Close to where we were staying one woman was raped by 65 men. Can you imagine 65 men?"

"Hmm... " It was not difficult to imagine the horror of it. There had been so many stories about the horrors in Gujarat.

"I know what it feels like," her voice suddenly louder, "I know... because once this bastard called me home and then four of his friends also came in... and I couldn't do a thing. Can a fucking fish complain about the water she's in. You're a fucking fish, they'd say. So you have to keep swimming and swimming... till you die fucking."

Now we were both silent.

"Anyway it's all in the past now," she said as if it really was. "Do you want to do it? Because I want my full payment."

"Don't worry I'll pay you full... but could we just talk some more... at least till your time is up."

"Sure," she smiled, "What do you wanna talk about?"

"Umm... I don't know... anything. Anything you've learnt from your life as a..."

"As a whore?" she was laughing at my awkwardness.

"Yes that too." I smiled.

"You know the biggest lesson that I've learnt is that a woman's life means nothing in this world. She could be a good family girl or a whore... if she's alone she's fair game for every Tom, Dick and Harry."

Just when she said that the power went. We were engulfed in total darkness. As if on cue the next moment her cellphone lit up with a beep.

"Your time is up. And I have another appointment."

The power returned as suddenly as it had gone. I pulled out my wallet and paid her the amount I'd promised. I had got my story. Or perhaps the story had got me. Rati walked out of the door with her money and her broken soul.
