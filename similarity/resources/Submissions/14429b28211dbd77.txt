Bio: I graduated in Commerce from Mumbai, India and then went on to do my MBA from Ahmedabad. After having worked at a media house in Delhi (Hindustan Times) for 2.5 years, I left my job in September 2012, to backpack across the country at a budget of no more than Rs. 1000 a day (including travel, stay, food and all other expenses), spending a week each in 24 states across India and writing short stories set in that state. During my adventure, I blogged and received more than 50000 page views for the same. 


Stench 

Ravinder Singh had looked for the source of that stench inside his taxi for 2 months now. That dirty, rotten smell was always there. He would hear passengers complain about it in the day and not respond. In the first few days, he had looked everywhere for the source - under the hood, in the boot, under the seats. After a week, he had partly given up and partly become immune to its presence. But sometimes when he would have a hot, fresh meal in his taxi, the stench would hit him again. Somewhere inside his 1989 Premier Padmini was a dead, rotting fish. 

He was an old man. He had spent 20 years in that taxi; going round and round the city. His long, flowing beard had turned snow white from mehndi brown and his turban, brown from red. The tiny nooks of the face that the hair and the turban had spared revealed a complex map of lines and troughs. The bushy moustache muffled his voice when he posed his usual questions to his passengers. There were not many curves on the frail man's body, except a slight hunch in the back. 

It was the night of Ganesh Visarjan. Ravinder Singh had deposited a fat family from Dadar Terminus to Lohar Chawl and was planning to turn in for the night now. He parked his car at its customary spot under the flyover and popped into the shower at the Sulabh Shauchalaya across the road. He washed his white uniform while he was showering and came out in his briefs and vest. He laid the washed uniform on the windshield and put the wiper on them as paperweight. He deposited his badge in the glove box. 

The thing about the island under the flyover is that everything is magnified here. On the day of the Visarjan it is the worst - all those Honey Singhs, Anuradha Paudwals and Pitbulls sound even more annoying under the flyover. The sirens of ambulances passing by sound even more frantic here - Ravinder wondered often if any of the travelling patients had ever died of that pandemonium before their injury could claim their life. Small and big coteries of people were returning from ShivajiPark after the immersion. 

Then at one end of the island under the flyover, Ravinder's feeble sight could make out some people trying to dig a ditch through loose concrete. He looked more closely to realize it was the same family he had seen there for so many months now. The woman was digging with single-minded concentration and the three kids were helping out, between bouts of dancing to their favorite tunes from the huge Ganpati processions passing by. But the husband was nowhere to be seen. 

Why someone would be digging a ditch under the flyover, in the middle of the night had piqued Ravinder's curiosity but not enough to make him drag his tired body to that end of the flyover where the odour of the urine was the strongest. He resolved to focus on the vigorous digging being carried out by the woman - each stroke a story in itself - with ebbs and surges; resolve and relief. The kids in their young, croaky voice were sinister in their laughter and derisive in their attitude towards the woman. Then, Ravinder thought he saw the man too - lying limp in one corner on a single sheet of flex banner. As Ravinder got comfortable in the back seat, his last conscious memory before he went to sleep was this time when another taxi driver was telling him about a woman under the same flyover who was renowned to give massages to people's penises with a special ayurvedic oil which got their penises to enlarge by monstrous proportions - oh the things he had heard! 

The thing about the island under the flyover is that here even the silences are magnified. At around 5am, Ravinder woke up with a start. The city was finally deafeningly silent and it always shook Ravinder out of his sleep. His groggy eyes could make out the woman still at it, but the kids had vanished. The man still lay splayed across the flex banner - he didn't seem to have moved an inch since the last time Ravinder had seen him. Not for the first time that day, Ravinder smelt something fishy. 

Ravinder was chanting his Benti Chaupai with one eye on the scene, when a woman came and asked if he would go to the airport. He looked from one woman to the other and made up his mind to keep doing his Karma. 

All day, the fishy smell followed Ravinder from Santacruz to Vashi, from Babulnath to Mira Road. It constantly gnawed at his mind and created stories of its own. 

When he finally reached his resting place, there was a mound of fresh soil on the sight where the ditch dug up the previous night. From his safe perch away from the scene, Ravinder could make out the length of the mound to more or less correspond to the height of the man he had seen sleeping on the flex banner. 

As if hypnotized, his tired limbs started towards the mound. But just as he was moving past one of the pillars of the flyover, he saw another man approach stealthily from the other end. He was wearing tattered clothes and was carrying a spade. Ravinder hid behind the pillar and saw the man dig his way into the fresh soil. As he went on digging, the perspiration on his forehead started dripping - there were bright, orange droplets with the color from the tilak on his forehead. 

This went on for 15 minutes and Ravinder was too scared to move. Finally the man was done digging and out emerged 5 bags - black, opaque, stubborn, polythene. The man put them in two jute sacks he was carrying and, after a furtive glance around him, scurried away back from where he had come. 

Clearly, the bags seemed heavy. Together, they seemed as heavy as a grown man. A grown man that was probably killed and then chopped into pieces by an angry wife, compelled to practice mild versions of prostitution and deranged children, looking for some thrills. 

Once the man had left, Ravinder ambled to the ditch and looked inside. It was unremarkably empty. So ironic considering it had been home to such a gory secret, only minutes ago. Ravinder shook his head at the grotesque, everyday brutality he had to endure, and returned back to his taxi, more tired than ever. 

Grotesque, everyday brutality 

What if that man lying on the flex banner yesterday was simply asleep? What if that homeless family was digging a ditch to store all its possessions, before it went to its village for a few days? What if those bags held in them all that they owned and this man had just robbed them of whatever little they had? 

Would the brutality be more grotesque or less? 

It's like the fishy smell in Ravinder's car. You don't get all answers. But, over time, you do get immune to the stench. And its source ceases to matter.
