I am glad to send you my submission *Loose Nathan and the Wild Berry*. This is a work of fiction about a young man in a hill-town, living in an altered state of mind because of his psychological condition. The story addresses the anomalies in approaching cures for mental disorders in village communities and in low-income groups. On another level, this story looks at the differently abled and their integration in society. 

My bio and the text of the short story is placed within this email as per your website instructions. 

Thank you for reviewing my work. I look forward to your response. 

Very best wishes, 

Sujatha

*Biography* 

In 1995, NID designer Sujatha Shankar Kumar quit her well-established furniture design practice in Bangalore to pursue her passion for storytelling. At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she joined the MFA program, combining her interest in spatial design with filmmaking and storytelling. Her work in parallel streams of art and design, led her to experiment with photography, film, poetry and writing. After eight years in Chicago, Sujatha returned to Chennai, India in 2003, where she worked in photographic conservation and art photography, writing alongside. She has had several exhibitions of her photographic works accompanied with her narratives and poems. She has participated in poetry readings including for Poetry with Prakriti in Chennai and contributes to *The Hindu* on art, culture and literature. Mythology, the anima of place and finding extraordinary connections in ordinary events form a strong basis for Sujatha's writing. For her, writing must free the mind yet make a deep connect with the reader.

*Loose Nathan and the Wish-berry* 

Whenever we went to the hills, we stayed at Wild-Berry Cottage. At the end where Ridge Road inclined up to Potato Hill, it forked to the right before the start of the ascent, at the place they called Boar Creek though there were no boars to speak of anymore and the spring was a trickle ending in a marsh where dragonflies buzzed incessantly, telling each other how it used to be in the past. Everyone spoke of those days, better times, unlike now. The slope of the road as it curved on the right was gentle and few could complain of the walk up to the ramshackle cottage on the north side of Boar Creek where the old woman lived with her two sons and her husband. The townsfolk conceded that they were unfortunate and counted the days as she grew older, worried for her passing, for no one knew what would happen to her sons. The older fellow, Anthony, rather slow, made some money cutting grass and all the grass he cut, he would feed his cow. Whenever the cow had a calf, they milked her.  At other times, they would send the younger boy Nathan down to the depot to get half a litre of milk. They could not afford more than that, not even to buy a litre for the four of them. 

It was clear from the start that something was wrong with Nathan as he spoke to himself all the time and did not talk to anyone else much. He was content it seemed laughing to himself and fighting his own arguments, doubting riddles he posed to himself, unlike the rest of us who argued with each other about who was right or wrong. At the bottom of Ridge Road was the old bund where the stream once descended in full rush to become Ridge Spring, now a sludge where tourists threw paper cups and tin foil wrappers. Nathan regularly sat on the crumbling wall of the bund tapping his chin with a finger thoughtfully. His rambling would start with a mumbling and grow into loud strident tones as he got angrier about something that his mind had posed to him with which he did not agree. There was only him and his own mind so at the end, winning or losing did not matter. It was entirely up to him and eventually he would accede, sometimes miserably with a shrug like he could not help it after all, sometimes with a laugh acknowledging the foibles of life. He would then get up from his perch and go to the depot next to the Company Store to get his half litre of milk in the aluminium canister with its lid and handle. When he went down with it empty, he swung it about merrily and when he came back with the milk, he was careful not to swing it as much. The men at the Company Store tolerated Nathan. They knew he could not live without his tea and his smoke and willingly gave him free tea and *beedis* when he swung by. He would stand expectantly as Raiza, the shop girl made tea on the kerosene stove, its flame sizzling.  She added spoons of tea turning the water wine-red and then creamy brown when she poured in milk. Nathan carried his own steel tumbler in his pocket if he remembered. As there were many Nathans on the hills, they called him Loose Nathan when referring to him, but the hill-folk cared about him and believed that his was not an affliction to be wished on someone so no one ever called him that to his face or family. 

It was not for want of trying that he was not cured. The old woman was a caretaker for the Yellow Bungalow whose owner Bala K. Chari, commiserating with the family, offered to take Nathan to the city where they would treat him. The old woman agreed, not reluctantly; if anyone could help her son to regain some lucidity, it would be a stroke of fortune. They got Nathan a new set of clothes and two spare sets. The neighbours contributed money and they went to the local tailor who stitched him a cotton shirt and a pair of trousers. The tailor was instructed to make the clothes light as it would be hot in the plains. Nathan watched the goings on with diffidence. As the day drew closer for his journey out, the old woman felt her heart beat faster and her legs did not carry her so well on her visits out to the neighbours. Relatives and friends gave her meals sometimes and she helped them out, washing clothes or vessels. She prayed constantly for Nathan to be alright. The owner took Nathan by bus to the train stop in the plains. From there, they would journey out overnight. A cousin of Nathan's accompanied them for the trip as otherwise he was sure to get flustered with the trepidation of travelling to an unknown place. Nathan mumbled as usual to himself, sitting on the bench at the station platform, rocking forward and backward, helpless without any knowledge of what was happening. Cousin Raja comforted him, holding his arm sometimes and the touch seemed to help. 

Next day, they reached the city early morning and Nathan was admitted in a care centre and analysed. From his symptoms and condition, they concluded he had schizophrenia. They told Cousin Raja that from now on they would take care of him and Bala K. Chari agreed to pay for the medicines and boarding. Nathan was put on treatment and housed in a tenement away from the city, around which there were no trees or habitation. The treatment centre was just off the highway, some hundred kilometres from the city in a desolate area. As it was a social welfare group that had set it up, they had procured land where they could afford to buy. In the distance, through the even blotch of Casuarinas planted a mile away, you could see a strip of the sea and the haze mounting over it mid-afternoon as the sun played havoc and the water vapour hung in the air above, making it humid and hot and rendering all life untenable. It was strange territory for Nathan and while the doctors claimed he was calmer and much more manageable, inside him was a panic he could not understand. It did not stem from his numerous inner voices, his constant companions who could be quite dominating at times - that quarrelsome wench who often told him he was a fool and he was wrong, or that deep voice of a soldier who surfaced sometimes, constantly talking about a war: it was none of these which induced his panic. The pressure came from outside, the heat he was unused to, the fat dark nurse who shoved pills down his throat and made him drink lots of water, the matron who made him wash his sweaty clothes, the hard bed with its sheet of Madras checks in blue and yellow on dirty cream. The worry came from the tepid surroundings and unfamiliar terrain without trees, without hills where the Company Store, *chai* and *beedis *were missing and there was no milk-can to swing or coins in his pocket to jingle as he walked. He could not confide in anyone as his tales belonged to him alone. His was an interior world that was forced to deal with the exterior even if he hung curtains on his windows, even if he changed those curtains from patterns of green tendrils to white daisies on yellow. 

One day, he jumped the wall and escaped when they least expected any trouble from him. He was possibly nervous, perhaps terrified, but he was free.  The authorities at the centre called Chari and informed him that Nathan had skipped the grounds. Chari, in turn, conveyed the news to the old woman and she was distraught. The city was sprawling, large and not easily navigable for an incoherent mind and somewhere in this hostile jungle of buildings, roads and traffic, her son was lost. 

Lost was not a new word to Nathan. He had always been missing and could not be claimed by anyone. That was his special status, a privilege to which he was entitled. No one knew what he knew and he would not tell anyone. He walked and walked, begged for change and free rides and somehow kept travelling. The police could not find him and Chari gave up. On a trip to the hills, I met the old woman. She gave me a photograph, an ancient piece of black and white in which her son looked straight out at nothing. His hair was tossed in that inimitable way, and the look in his eyes could be termed crazed.  "When you go back to the city, try find him if you can", she said.  She promised me, as if it mattered, that he would never harm anyone. He was the gentlest of souls, the most benevolent. Tears welled up in her proud eyes, the fine wrinkles on her face like creases of wisdom, her white hair neatly tied back in a bun. On the long lobes of her ears, brass earrings in a cluster of pyramids hung. I did not even know her name and I never asked.  She went back down the slope, towards her house, leaving me with her charge. 

When I returned to the city, I went and met Chari, who also appeared lost. His eyes were uncoordinated, and one looked in a different direction than the other so you could not tell whether he was looking at you or something else. He could not answer my questions at length and it was not because he was avoiding my queries. It was soon evident that Chari too was not all there. All the while we spoke, his eye kept twitching and his left hand jerked in involuntary spasms. Nevertheless, he promised me that if he got any news, he would let me know and gave me his card. I called Rose the caretaker in Wild-Berry Cottage and asked her to inform the old woman who was her friend that I had no luck, but if some clue turned up, she'll be the first to know. I kept the passport size photograph of Nathan in my desk drawer, right on top, to remind myself. Once in a while, when I saw it, I was assuaged by guilt. Nathan stared out from those confines of paper, bewitched and bewildered, a face that questioned what on earth we were all doing with our lives. 

It was late September when I went back to the hills and the old woman as usual was walking up the slope. She stopped and smiled. "He's back. Nathan is here. He came home a month back." 

I was amazed but relieved. "How did he come home?" 

"We don't know. He managed somehow. He's alright. He has to take his medicines Ayyah Chari says. Some days he does, other times he does not." 

Nathan was back like cats who always return from their exploits and like homing pigeons sent out with messages across skies, only to definitely return. From then on, we shared camaraderie, the old woman and I. "Don't send him anywhere", I cautioned. "He's happiest here, from all that you have told me." 

Three summers later, her old man broke his leg when he fell from a ladder, missing his step. He was climbing up to replace broken tiles on a roof in a house where he had been commissioned for work. He was laid up in bed and it was a loss for them as Nathan could not earn and it was hard to manage with just the money his brother Anthony  made from cutting grass and helping with gardens wherever he was called. To make matters worse, the old woman fell sick. She recovered in a week though and came walking up the slope and wished me as usual. "I am better. I was not so well last week", she acknowledged, smiling. Her expression was beatific, her face sublime, her white hair glowing in the early morning sun. The next week after, she took ill again and this time she could not breathe. Sometime that night, she died in the hospital. It was early morning, when Rose told us. I asked her what the old woman's name was as I had never found out and she said, "Salette, after the church of La Salette." 

The township announced the passing of a rich man on loudspeakers but not Salette's.  Her family did not have money to pay for the announcement.  It was Anthony's cow that mooed faithfully, bellowing louder and louder that morning, drowning out the speakers, the valley reverberating with her resounding cries. The townsfolk prepared for Salette's burial with the money they all collected and as the old man's leg was broken, they carried him to the church where the body was laid. Anthony blinked nervously, tears flowing down his eyes. He was dressed in a shirt someone had loaned him, over it wearing the only coat he possessed. They all worried as he was a simpleton, an innocent fellow, and as for Nathan, he could not even understand. Somehow, they had to make him comprehend so Rose's son pulled him to the open coffin and bade him kiss his mother goodbye. Bewildered, Nathan kissed her. Then they shut the lid of the coffin. From the church, they organized a hearse to carry the body to the cemetery. They lowered the coffin into the dugout grave and then the priest presiding called Anthony to throw in the earth. They pulled Nathan closer and he clenched the soil in his fist, resisting. "Throw it in", said Rose, "Here, I'll give you a wild berry. You can wish on it, whatever you want." With tears in her eyes, Rose stuffed a berry in his hand. Then, Nathan threw the soil into the grave with the berry and it landed with a thud. He watched as they covered the coffin and the last physical evidence of his mother, disappeared. He got worried then. "Where is my mother?" he asked. "Why is she missing?" He looked around for her frantically. They all felt helpless, but he was far more helpless than them. 

"He does not understand", said Rose to us when we met. "Yesterday and today, he did not go for a single *beedi* or tea. He suspects something is not alright. Maybe this will be his dawning. Somehow clarity will descend. There must be some reprieve for everyone." On the third day, we saw him going down the street with the milk-canister. He was sober and though he spoke in whispers, something in him was resolved.  Rose liked to think that it was a wish on a wild-berry. I like to think that the hills have secrets for everyone, a place where every wish is heard, like echoes that come back to us from across the valley, our calling out, returning to us.
