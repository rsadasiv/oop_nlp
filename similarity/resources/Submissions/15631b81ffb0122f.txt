This is Anasuya Shreedhar, a PhD scholar in Women's and Gender Studies from Delhi, India. I had earlier been a copy-writer for several television channels after completing my post-graduation in Mass Communications. However, my passion to teach compelled me to return to academics. I have recently completed my MPhil and am currently pursuing a doctoral degree in the area of food and gender from the perspective of feminist food studies. I am also working on a non-fiction book based on the relationship between food and culture. 


*Kaansha-r Baashone:A Legacy of Loss* 

It was the onset of *kartik*. Preparations for *Mahalaya* were well underway. For years, Ranu had insisted on buying a few utensils made of *kaansha* to spread *maa Durga’s naivedyam. *But every time her fervent requests were met with a firm “no.” *Kaansha* had its own charm making copper hide in shame. The matte gold like finish, the glistening grandeur upon a sumptuous spread. It was regal. It was majestic. 

The news had spread like wild fire. Two villages had been looted and people had fled for their lives, leaving behind everything. Yes, the violence was very close to home. Bimal, the eldest of seven, had to make up his mind. The other side held promises, of hope, peace and perhaps, prosperity. Perhaps. But how would he convince *baba*? And what about the house, the acres of paddy fields, the granary, the gold and the prized collection of *kaanshar baashone*? 

The evening class got over and the students were gearing up for a night session of *adda*. But Bimal had to rush to his hostel before the mess called it a day. One year had passed and he still missed home. But the thought of his family joining him in the next six months provided some comfort, for the time being. The greatest relief was that *baba *had agreed. He was left with no choice. Die there or live here. 

The violence was sporadic but brutal. With pounding hearts, the siblings began the perilous journey carrying the bare minimum, informing curious neighbours that they were going to meet their brother Bimal, pursuing higher studies in Calcutta. Finally, *maa *and *baba *arrived to the warm welcome of his sisters. 

*Puti pishi *served *baba* tea while Bimal prepared to disclose his plans. *Baba*, as always, spoke first. 

“I don’t know what your plans are. But I will go back, to where I belong.” 

“But *baba*, the situation has worsened.” 

“I won’t breathe my last here. Understand that, Bimal.” 

Months passed and the “warm welcome” soon changed to bitter obligation. Scattered among relatives, siblings and parents bore the humiliation of living under the “benevolence” of prosperous aunts and uncles. Despite a job and working overtime, he was unable to gather enough money for a humble accommodation for his family. His plans were going awry leading to despair. Doubts pervaded his thoughts every day. Was it foolish to have left everything behind? Perhaps, it was better to live inside a camp, like the thousands of refugees who crossed the border. At least they would have all lived together and may be with some dignity. Life had become a synonym for ignominy. 

*Boishakh* moved into *joishtho, ahshaar *and *sraabon*. The monsoons struck the land of the bhadralok with a vengeance. Dalhousie, the hub of all offices was flooded, much to the chagrin of the babus who had to wade their way to work. Amidst the clamour of thunderous showers, came the speeches of the *naxals*, made accessible through the humble transistor. Bimal, stared outside, at the grey clouds, all huddled together like a symbol of sinister foreboding. Even the clouds back home had a charm. It was never ominous. It brought with it mirth and laughter; the rains bathed the paddy fields making it a breeding ground for shrimps. Rains meant eating *khichudi* and the *padma ilish*, served of course in *kaansh *saucers. Rains meant listening to ghost stories while sitting close under a home stitched *kaantha*. Rains meant all things that were now denied to Bimal. 

“Bimal, Bimal, results have been declared. Let’s go.” 

Bimal jolted back to reality; a reality where *ilish* was only a delicious memory, replaced by *daal-bhaat* served on an aluminum plate! 

First Class. And Bimal was finally a law graduate. But it was just the beginning of another hurdle. Most of his peers came from a legal lineage; it was more of *stepping into father’s shoes* kind of a thing. But Bimal had no such luxury. He came from a family of land owners from *East Pakistan* who today have not a piece of land to their names, surviving on the “kindness” of relatives. 

*Bhadro* changed to *ashshin *and *ashshin* changed into *kartik.* And along with *Kartik *came *maa* *Durga*. The very air was filled with exuberance and gaiety. The *pandals,* the rhythmic beats of the *dhaak *synchronizing with the ebb and flow of the *Hooghly*, the array of sweetmeats on display, the chitter-chatter, the blissful chaos, all seemed to engulf the city in a joyous embrace. Forget the political turbulence brewing, forget the burning villages, forget the massacres, forget the steady annihilation, just for those few days. Yes. *Maa Durga* had the power to assist in amnesia, only till she bid adieu. Bimal’s amnesia also ended. 

The refugee crisis was national news. War was a possibility. It was a political crisis unforeseen and of mammoth magnitude. Stories of despair, helplessness, rootlessness and loss became the everyday narrative. And *baba*’s dreams of returning to his home seemed bleaker and bleaker. And that bleakness took away *baba*’s life as well, little by little, with every passing day. 

*Ogrohayon* moved into *poush *and *poush* moved into *magh.* It was one of the most bitter winters, physically and emotionally. The slurs and taunts were at an all time high, taking humiliation to unknown altitudes. *Puti pishi* would grudge even the morning cup of tea to* baba* even though he had raised her after the demise of her father. The siblings survived on the memory of their past life. And Bimal longed for the day when he could leave his hostel, earn enough to rent a small place and bring his family together. The wait seemed to last forever. 

The ignominy made a dreamer out of Bimal; blissfully slipping into a memory of a not-so-distant past. The alleys, the sweet shop, the fresh milk, the walks by the river, the lavish meals, the starched clothes, the bicycle rides to school, all seemed to grow distant and Bimal was in no mood to let go of it. After all that was him, his identity, his life, his roots, his world where everything was in abundance, including respect. The more he tried to hold on to it, the more it slipped away. Including his respect. 

The longest winter came to an end for Bimal as *Magh *slipped into *falgun* and West Bengal fell into President’s rule. Cases piled up, so much so that the staff strength could not match the sudden surge. Bimal made most of the situation. He took upon himself more than he could have ever done in a span of a year. But he plunged headlong. The pressure almost choked him. Even that was more honourable than dying every day. 

It was the last leg of *choitro*. The season had changed and so did Bimal’s fortune. What a day it was, what a moment when he entered his one room home, with *putul*, *pori*, *mitul*, *moni*, *khokon*, *chhoton*, *maa* and *baba*. Away from obligations, away from sarcasms, away from snide remarks, away from bitterness. It was a small room with a perennial problem of seepage; but they were together, at last, on their own, living on their own terms. 

The country headed for war. It was clear what the* mukti bahini *wanted. *Baba’s *hopes grew. Hopes to return to his native; hopes to breathe the *bangla* air; hopes to return to normalcy; hopes to return to previous glory. But fate had other plans. As Bimal’s cousins arrived in Calcutta, news of horror unleashed. Bimal’s house had been occupied; the granary emptied; the paddy fields destroyed and the gold looted. Whatever was built and accumulated over generations disappeared, just like that. The only thought that gave some courage to Bimal were the precious utensils that were transferred in heavy trunks over two years, bit by bit, inconspicuously and kept in “safe keeping” of Calcutta relatives. He was not completely penniless, after all. Perhaps, he should have done the same with the gold as well. But who would have thought that the loot would happen so fast. And besides, it was *maa* who insisted that the utensils be transferred first, the priceless *kaansha.* 

The plates, saucers, ladles, glasses were collected, some through gifts and some through purchase. In those days only the affluent could afford *kaansh*. *Maa* boasted of a rich dowry consisting of all kinds of wares, some with intricate designs and much to the envy of the other brides in the family. One by one, as *maa* bore her children, she got gifted even more. Each plate, each glass, even each spoon had the names of her children inscribed on it. Almost all the seven children had a collection that they could call their own. And *maa *was satisfied; her family’s fortunes, especially her daughters’ future were settled. 

Bimal worked and worked and worked; never knew when morning slid into night and the moon gave way to sunrise. All he knew was to make his mark in the legal profession and reclaim, reclaim all that was lost. Move into a bigger house and bring back all the trunks of *kaansh*, the only remains of a life that was. 

Another *kartik* approached. *Putul* and gang were busy with the festivities. *Maa *thought of bringing home one trunk so they could all eat their *bijoya *lunch in their favourite *kaanshar baashone.* But life is full of surprises, at times unpleasant. *Maa* visited *pipi di’s* house to claim her possession. To her utter bewilderment coupled with shock, *pipi di *expressed her lack of knowledge on the matter. She asked her husband, her three sons and her two daughters. All feigned ignorance. But how could it be. Both *putul *and *pori* had lived with their *pipi pishi* for close to two years. They had seen two trunks kept “safely” in the *thakur ghor*. How could they now deny its existence? Life is strange, at times treacherous. 

The month of *magh* resurfaced. An unabashed *pipi di* came to invite her once-wealthy-and-now-downtrodden younger brother to her daughter’s marriage. *Baba *remained mute throughout the short conversation. *Maa* nodded in the affirmative, in the gratitude that *pipi di *had looked after *putul *and *pori *for close to two years. But little did she realize what lay ahead of her. 

The lavish wedding trousseau was on display. The *rani haar, *the voluptuous *chaand bali*, the intricate *mantaasha*, the countless *benarasi sarees* and an elaborate spread of *kaanshar baashone*. *Maa *went dizzy and fell on the floor. For days she kept mumbling, “How could she?” 

*Magh* came to an end but the bitterness continued, for *maa *and *baba*. They could not reconcile to the unpleasantness, the betrayals and the paradigm of loss. Every day was a reminder to the fact that going back was not an option. For better or for worse, this city would be their home. Bimal had grown immune to the loss. He was beginning to carve a new identity for himself. At times, however, his mind, prone to human frailties, would go back to those moments, when he took risks to ensure the safe passage of the trunks, loaded with *maa*’s priceless possessions. 

Six trunks had to make a perilous journey to reach the other side, the home to be. *Baba* was completely against the idea as the shift meant eventual relocation to a land he could never connect with, in spite of having married sisters who loved every bit of the city. But it had to be done. The gold could be carried later and the land could be looked after till the chaos subsided and sold at a competitive value. 

It was *sraabon* and the rains were destructive making ferries a dangerous option. Only one trunk could be transferred at a time, to avoid suspicion. The atmosphere was ripe with fear, resentment and doubt. It was difficult to understand who was from the *mukti bahini* and who was a *razaakar*. One had to be careful of the latter, very careful. 

*Niyaz*, a rice merchant and *Khaugen*, a milk vendor, both Bimal’s friends, helped in the transfer. The plan was to follow the river *padma*, stay away from roads leading to Dhaka and be as invisible near volatile *Jessore* and reach the border. A humble milk cart pulled by two sturdy bullocks carried *maa’s *trunk, across mustard and paddy fields, through mud and muck, under roaring thunder and hail, treading precariously, away from the discerning eyes of robbers and soldiers alike and entered the border right before dawn when security was relatively relaxed. Bimal waited in a numbing silence at a tea stall, waiting for his cycle ridden milk cart. Yes, the cycle replaced the bullocks on this side of “home.” 

And today, the prized valuables have adorned some bride’s trousseau. Deceit has many faces. 

President’s rule ended. *Khokon *cleared his matriculation. *Putul *dropped out of school and *pori* followed suit. *Chhoton, Mitul *and *moni* struggled with their syllabus. *Baba* lay in bed most of the times, occasionally listening to *Feroza Begum*. *Maa *prepared herself for further betrayals from her kin. And Bimal enrolled for masters in law, evening class, of course. The sky was clearing. 

Another *Kartik *arrived bringing *devi durga* in all her power and glory. But *maa* could not muster up the courage to seek the remaining trunks from relatives’ “safe custody.” For how long would she avoid the encounter? 

The war had begun. But Bimal had other worries. *Putul’s *marriage. *Maa* finally made the much avoided visit to the house of her brother-in-law, settled comfortably in the shoe business of his father-in-law. *Barin* was cordial. After the small talks and customary tea, *maa* approached the topic of the three trunks that was under his care. His face fell and *maa* knew that something was terribly wrong. He threw himself at *maa’s *feet, begging for forgiveness. *Maa *calmed him down. After the floodgates of tears closed, *Barin* spoke. *Maa *was horrified but not hurt. Apparently *Barin* was struck with bad luck in his business. So to salvage the situation he had to sell all the contents the trunks had to offer. As simple as that. 

*Putul* married. Hers’ was the most Spartan trousseau, thereby, becoming fodder for spicy family gossip. *Maa* refused to enquire about the last trunk. It was her way of returning a favour to *puti*, the little girl who *baba* had brought up. 

Slogans of Joy Bangla resonated everywhere. Mujib returned to Bangladesh. The country was celebrating its victory. *Baba* turned off the radio. 

The year West Bengal officially became red, *baba* passed away. *Mitul* pursued academics while *pori* and *moni* took care of their marital homes. The brothers were a disappointment. Having quit their studies, they started a business only to fail miserably. They languished in their past glory, their aristocratic pride which looked almost comically grotesque against their new reality. *Maa* sought refuge in her incessant fasts and religious rituals. 

Seasons change and so do fortunes. Nothing is ever static. Flux is the spirit of life. And thank *whatever you look upto* (not necessarily god or heavens) for that! Years multiplied into decades. 

*Maa *looked at the card with her failing eyes. The nurse propped her up on the hospital bed. Her first grandchild was getting married to a doctor in London. *Putul* had made sure that the news reached everyone, especially the ones she despised. 

The trousseau became a rallying point of power and wealth, especially the newly bought *kaanshar baashone*. Eyes popped, jaws dropped, hearts burnt. And who could be happier? *Putul*, of course, especially in the presence of her once-wealthy-now-downtrodden aunts and uncles. 

Keka, Bimal’s daughter, found such ostentatious display quite crude. She was aware of the past but felt such an exhibition was silly. She had grown up listening to the anecdotes from her father, of a life in a small village, on the other side of the border. She could sense her beloved *bapi’s *eyes become moist while narrating those stories. She understood the silence when *bapi* refused to answer her recurring question: “*bapi,* do you want to go back to *faridpur? *Do you miss *faridpur*?” 

The grand day came and went, amidst much joy and tears. Then each went about their mundane lives. But life is full of surprises, at times pleasant and you never know what awaits you the next moment. 

*Mahalaya* is the very day when goddess *durga* was invoked to descend on earth to vanquish *mahishasur, *the demon. The day marks the victory of good over evil. Bimal had been hosting the *pujo *for the past eighteen years. The ceremony got over. The guests left after a sumptuous *bhog* of *khichudi, laabra,* *ghee bhaat, shukto, bhaaja moong dal, chaatni, roshogolla* and *paayesh.* Ranu, Bimal’s wife was meticulously packing sweets to be distributed in the neighbourhood when to her sheer surprise and wonder, she saw *puti pishi* at her doorstep. Covering her head hastily with her *pallu*, she bent down to touch *pishi’s *feet. 

Life had not been very kind towards her. She lost her husband to cancer and that drained her resources considerably. Her sons had turned their backs on her and all she wanted was to join her husband, soon. 

Bimal was happy but did not probe into the reasons behind her visit. Over the years he had learnt to be less analytical. Such a stance helps keeping pain at bay. After the usual gossip, oh so-and-so is in Colorado; so-and-so’s husband is unwell; so-and-so’s daughter had eloped, etc., *puti pishi* took something out from her jute bag. Joy and dismay followed. 

Bimal looked at two large *kaansha *plates, held together by a pair of frail hands, veins protruding. 

*Rainy afternoons, paddy fields, stealing fried fish from the kitchen, celebrating the birth of a calf,  listening to horror stories while thunder clapped ferociously; the alleys, the bicycle rides, the padma river, the village, niyaz, khaugen…beloved faridpur…* 

*Puti pishi*’s wails interrupted Bimal’s time travel. 

“Forgive me Bimal…*dada* suffered a lot because of me.” 

Ranu tried to console a howling and apologetic *puti pishi.* 

“I know I have no face, I have done the most abominable thing, deprived *dada* and *boudi* of what rightfully belonged to them. Forgive me Bimal, so I can die in peace.” 

Bimal was stoic. 

“My children have taken away most. I somehow managed to keep these two. See, your name is inscribed on both.” 

Of course, how could Bimal not recognize his *dadu’s* gift? After a spell of silence and a nudge from Ranu, Bimal opened his mouth. 

“Why now? Let it be. I have forgotten that episode.” 

“No Bimal. This belongs to you.” 

“Yes. There were many things that belonged to *maa* and *baba*. Not anymore.” 

“You are angry, right? You have every right to be angry. But please take it. If not for yourself, at least for your two daughters, as an heirloom, as memory of a life that was, your life…” 

Bimal gave a wry smile, sat close to *puti pishi* and wrapped his arms around her trembling shoulders. 

“*Pishi,* I am not angry at all. I had a life from which I was separated painfully thirty years ago. I would give my daughters memories of happiness, not loss. This is my home and this is where I belong. Let *faridpur* be where it belongs, to another country, along with these two plates.” 

With that Bimal hugged *pishi *tightly.
