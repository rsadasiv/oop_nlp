I am a law student currently studying at the University of Oxford. I've been working on a short story over the past few months that deals with themes of caste, culture, and ethics in early 90s Kerala set in a fictional village. I hope you enjoy it. 

*A man lay in the mud* 

A man lay in the mud, blood gushing out of his slit throat. Stalks of rice swayed around him, dancing to the frenzied tune that the wind had set. The moon peeked out of a cloud, bathing the scene with dull white light. Fireflies danced about, some of them settling on the man’s face. He gurgled and spluttered, thick droplets of blood mingling with the red mud and trickling away. His eyes were wild as he strained to listen to the unearthly music of a flute only he could hear. 

As the rickety truck shot down the mud road, the bearded man sprawled out in the back searched for changes in the scenery. And he found quite a few. The trees were the same of course, although there were now gaps that were not there before - mud roads connecting one part of Cholakkil to another. And a few shops had sprung up in the interim. Small brick shacks selling packets of *murukkus* and sweets. But the man was surprised to note that even after all these years it still felt the same. The strange sense of vertigo. The impression of slowly but steadily driving into the past. Memories of long-forgotten conversations and games of carom trickled into his mind’s eye. Thoughts he had not bothered to think in a very long time. 

The road meandered through a dense jungle made up of mostly banyan trees. All of them connected to each other through giant aerial roots, twisted like cords and disfigured by tumours. In a way, the jungle surrounding Cholakkil was one great banyan that had existed since the very beginning. An over-protective despot sheltering its subjects from the goings-on outside. 

But the despot seemed to be losing to a coup mounted by its wards. As the truck neared its destination, the jungle grew sparser, its place taken by low buildings – apartment complexes not higher than three stories, and half empty bakeries with mouldy cakes sitting out at front, bare to the elements. There was a faint cloud of dust hanging over the road – when the trees had gone, so had the soil’s willingness to stick to the ground. Civilisation had reached Cholakkil. 

The truck rounded a corner somewhere and went down a mud road that was inclined sharply downwards. The driver slowed down to a snail’s pace – a wrong turn here would send the old vehicle crashing down – giving the bearded man the opportunity to study his surroundings. This part of Cholakkil was uncluttered by buildings and the trees were huge and grew close together. The ruins of ancient walls jutted out of the ground at regular intervals. The man had grown up on folktales – very often contradictory – of who had built them and what they had been part of. The kind of story that ended with a question. Was the king right to refuse the sage? Were the princes being foolish in venturing into the forest? 

He was surprised that the ruins were still around. Most of the houses in the area had been built out of bricks salvaged from them. What might once have been the ramparts of a magnificent coastal city had been taken apart and mixed with cheap cement to make tiny block houses with corrugated steel roofs. Seized by the symbolism of lower caste peasants picking apart the remnants of an oppressive past, the Communist government of the ‘60s had turned a blind eye to the practice. 

The truck passed by one of these houses. Through the open doorway the bearded man could see a lit fire. A woman sat next to it, rolling *chappatis*. She stopped for a moment to pull back her hair into a braid, leaving streaks of flour on her tired face. A little girl read a book by the light of the fire, her head resting against her mother’s thigh. Out in the veranda a man lay sprawled, deep asleep. Around him were empty bottles. 

At one stage of the truck’s laborious descent, the trees suddenly parted to reveal a woman sitting cross-legged on the ruin of a toppled pillar. Its base was littered with plastic wrappers and other rubbish – her lunch, probably. She was dressed in what can only be described as a shift - but so stained and faded it was impossible to make out its original colour. Her hair was matted and brown with dirt. Her eyes were closed but snapped open on hearing the racket caused by the truck. Her gaze met with the bearded man’s and held it. She then took out a weathered flute from a pocket and began to play it. Perhaps she was grateful for an audience, for however short a while. As the truck continued downwards, the mournful melody lingered in the air for a surprisingly long time. And even after it faded away the bearded man replayed the simple tune over and over in his head. 

At long last, the old truck came to a halt outside an imposing gate crusted over by rust and lichen. This was a new development – it had not always looked that way. There was a time when that gate was the talk of the town and the inhabitants of the house beyond, some of its most valued. The man stood in front of it for a long time, studying the house. It was a *nalukettu *– a great sprawling mansion characterised by an open courtyard in the centre, built for large, extended families. 

But somewhere along the way it had acquired a dilapidated, defeated look. The grand scale of it that was once so intimidating to newcomers now only served to emphasise the extent of the house’s ruin. There was no raucous laughter bursting from its open windows, nor were there any of the sounds of a busy household. The wind had stopped blowing and the colours were muted by the dusk. The man’s face was impassive. He swung the gate open. 

As its state hinted, the gate creaked loudly, scaring away a few crows nearby. It also caught the attention of a man sitting at the front, completely hidden in shadow, reclining on an armchair. He leaned forward and out of the darkness. He was around sixty, dressed only in a *lungi* – a long piece of cloth wrapped around his waist reaching down to the ground – as the custom was in this part of the world. He was also smoking a cigarette, which was not custom. At least, it had not been ten years ago. Limp grey strands of hair curtained a face that might once have been handsome. His eyes had a dull, glazed look. He was blind. 

“Who is it?” asked the old man in a raspy voice. 

The bearded man said nothing. 

“Who is it?” asked the old man again. 

“Do you recognise my voice, Sekharetta?” the bearded man replied. 

“No,” said Sekharetta, rising slowly from his chair, “But it is familiar. We have met before.” 

“It’s me, Siddhu.” 

The old man slowly got up, his arms shaking with strain as they gripped the sides of the armchair, his dead eyes beginning to brim with tears. 

“Siddhu? God! Is it you? Is it really you? Don’t tease a blind old man.” 

“It’s me Sekharetta. And I have so many stories to tell you. ” 

They were in the courtyard at the centre of the *nalukettu*. The architect had stayed true to conventional design. There was an artificial pond in the middle that took up half the space exposed to the open sky. Around it were wooden railings and delicately carved stone seats to lounge in. Sekharetta and the man were reclining on two of these. 

“You used to love this place as a boy,” said Sekharetta, lighting his third cigarette. 

“I certainly did,” replied the man. 

“Yet it takes you years to come visit.” 

“Work kept me busy. You know how it is.” 

“That I do.” said Sekharetta laughing, “But it’s not something to regret. *Malayali* men spend less time in their homeland and more time outside of it. That’s the way it has been for centuries.” 

“That’s true.” 

“We’ve always been crossing over to the Gulf. Hundreds of our menfolk jump on rickety *dhows* and brave the waves of the Arabian Sea, hoping against hope that they land in one of the good places – Qatar, Kuwait or Dubai. The unlucky ones never make it to a shore. And the unluckiest reach Saudi Arabia.” 

“I’ve heard things are bad there,” said the man. 

A loud wheezing laugh burst out of Sekharetta. “Oh it is. Remember your cousin Aditya? Regardless of what he did, I wouldn’t have wished Saudi on him.” 

“Is that where he is?” 

“Last I’d heard. An old friend of mine from the theatre circuit runs a shop there. In the Gold Souk in Riyadh. He saw the boy working as a construction worker at some site for a Sheikh.” 

“God. That’s terrible.” 

“Yes it is. But I suppose he didn’t have any option but to leave.” 

“No. He didn’t.” 

Sekharetta rubbed his eyes slowly. “It’s been a long time since I’ve thought of your cousin. Who…who would have thought? That he’d do that to that girl?” His sad eyes had a faraway cast to them. 

“I should have noticed,” he continued. “He was too…close to her.” 

“I know.” 

The conversation lapsed into topics of not much consequence, and then it lapsed further into silence. The bearded man noticed two fireflies dancing over the pool. They twirled in spirals around each other, blinking their lights erratically. He had read somewhere that there was actually a method to the mad blinking – a pattern unique to each of them. In the great swarms of insects flying around in the night sky, a lone firefly would spy from afar a pattern that intrigued it. And then it would flash back the same and tentatively move towards it. Suddenly the cacophony of lights around the two would fade away and all they would see were each other. It was a beautiful sight. And it was something he had never appreciated growing up, when he would see it every night. 

“I don’t blame you” said Sekharetta. “For not visiting, you know? There’s not much to visit here.” 

The bearded man said nothing. 

There was a noise at the entrance. The bearded man turned around to see a short, moustachioed man of around Sekharetta’s age wearing a black shirt and a kindly smile walking through the door towards them. He rose. 

“Nasser * etta*. You probably won’t recognise me. I’m Siddhu.” 

“Siddhu! My god,” said Nasser, “It’s been years. About a decade I think!” 

“More than that, I would imagine,” said the man. 

“I hardly recognise you. Maybe it’s because you didn’t have this great big beard back then!” 

“You always did have a habit of turning up when someone’s talking about you, didn’t you Nasser?” asked an amused Sekharetta after the pleasantries had run their course. 

“It’s from our theatre days Sekhar,” replied Nasser with a grin, “I’ve always known when it’s time to enter the scene.” 

“Let’s get something to drink,” said Nasser with a smile after his carom striker landed inside the hole for the third time. “Siddhu isn’t a boy anymore.” 

“Yes that’s true,” said Sekharetta, “Especially since he seems to plan on visiting only once a decade. Fetch the whisky Nasser.” 

Nasser rose and disappeared through a door. He closed it behind him. 

“How is Nasser *etta* doing these days?” asked the man, “Wasn’t he in the broiler chicken business?” 

“That was a long time ago,” replied Sekharetta, “It only lasted a few years after we shut down our law practice. People don’t buy from him anymore.” 

“Oh. Why’s that?” 

Sekharetta did not immediately reply. He leaned back on his seat and rubbed his eyes in a tired manner. He took another cigarette from his case and lit it. 

“He started to spend a lot of time with the *Paanans*,” said Sekharetta finally. “Right about the time you left. Out of the blue. He never gave me a reason for it.” 

“Now don’t get me wrong,” he continued. “They’re lovely people. And they sing like angels. But tell me, can you blame a *Namboodiri* or a *Warrier* for not buying chickens from a vendor who sells to *Paanans*?” 

“I thought the Brahmins weren’t supposed to eat meat in the first place.” 

“Oh things change. Cholakkil is modern these days.” 

The door opened and Nasser returned with three glasses and a bottle. He placed the glasses on the floor and began to fill them. 

“I saw a woman on the way here, on the ruins,” said the bearded man, “She was dressed in rags and played a flute. Who is she?” 

“Ah. Gauri. She’s a *Paanan *girl.” He said that as if it explained everything. 

“What happened to her?” 

“She’s mad, the poor thing. Got herself pregnant. So her family drove her out. It’s the oldest story in the world.” 

As if he could sense the bearded man’s uneasiness, Sekharetta continued: “She should have known better, Siddhu. The way she walked about the town. She got what was coming to her.” 

The bearded man said nothing. 

The three men sat staring at the pool at the centre of the courtyard. Its surface was perfectly unbroken – a mirror reflecting the full moon and stars above. Their half-finished carom game lay there in front of them, completely forgotten. All three were deep in thought. Each had much to reminisce about. 

*Sixteen years ago* 

A seventeen year old boy is laid out on the grass. He is in his secret place – a clearing only he knows about in a high hill some distance away from the outermost house in Cholakkil. His eyes are closed and he is focusing on the sunlight on his face. After a while it is the only thing he can feel. The warmth of it. The *heat *of it. He feels he *is* the sun - the sun god *Surya* in the avatar of a mortal. It is a regular ritual of his. But he is tired today. Before long, he falls asleep. 

When he wakes up night has already fallen. So far from the lights of Cholakkil, the stars are bright and clearly visible. There is a strong breeze and the grass and trees are lit up by the light of the moon. It is *Purnima *– a night of the full moon. And there are white flowers blooming everywhere, reflecting the light in such a way as to appear almost luminous. There is a small waterfall close by and the boy can hear the soft, muted sound of water crashing onto rock. 

But there is a different sound overlaying the crashing water. It is a low humming. 

No. It is a very soft voice singing. 

On his back, the boy listens to the singing. And with each lilting note his heart beats faster. After a while he gets onto his feet and makes his way to the waterfall. The moon is bright but it is still difficult to navigate the jungle at night. Dangerous even. He feels a strong need to get to the voice. He tears through the thick shrubbery and bumps his head on low-hanging branches in his impatience to reach the waterfall. He is afraid the song will abruptly stop, and its singer gone without a trace before he gets there. 

When the last stubborn branch has yielded, the boy finds himself in a clearing bigger than his own. He has never been here, nor heard of this place. The trees are larger here, and much taller, giving the impression of being deep inside a well. In front of him is a stream. And further back is the waterfall. But what immediately holds his attention is what lay in between the two. 

Beneath the waterfall is a great pond with large smooth rocks jutting out of it. On one of the rocks is a girl sitting cross-legged. She is dressed in a white *kasavu *sari. She has intertwined a few jasmine flowers in her hair. Fireflies swarm around her and all over the clearing, as if enraptured by her singing. A crowd of admirers cheering an artist. But when the boy steps into the clearing they disperse. As if sensing the disturbance, the girl stops singing and looks up. 

“What are you doing here?” she asks. 

The boy thinks of the old story of Artemis and the hunter. How the hunter had chanced upon Artemis bathing in a stream and could not tear his gaze away. With a single look of rage the goddess had turned him into a stag, hunted down and torn into pieces by his own hounds. 

But the girl’s eyes are far from enraged. Not even stern. They are simply curious. 

“What are you doing here?” she asks again, gently, as if careful not to scare him away. 

“I…I recognise you,” replies the boy. 

“I’m flattered,” she replies with a sarcastic smile. “I’ve only been tending your garden for half a year.” 

Embarrassed, the boy asks, “Could you tell me your name?” 

“Chandri,” she replies, after a moment’s hesitation. “It stands for the moon.” 

Sekharetta took a big swallow of his drink and groaned in satisfaction as the liquid trickled down his throat, his eyes closed and head tilted back. “Do you know what the word *nasha* means, Nasser?” 

“The Urdu word? It means ‘intoxication’, doesn’t it? The *Ghazal *singers use it a lot.” 

“Yes I suppose that’s what it means now. But the word has lost its essence. It used to have a very spiritual quality. It is what the Sufi dervishes felt when they twirled around. It is what Rumi felt when he penned his verses. What they were doing, was catching a glimpse of God.” 

“But us mere mortals,” he continued, “We can only experience it by proxy.” 

For some reason this piqued the bearded man’s interest. He had been quiet, lost in contemplation. But he leaned forward now, staring intently at his uncle’s face. 

“The things I did in my youth to find that feeling,” continued Sekharetta, “The stories would fill several books. I gave up in the end. That’s when I grew up – the moment I realised there was nothing special about me.” 

This was obviously an important topic for Sekharetta. His eyes had taken on a feverish glint as he spoke. 

“But it was all I had, you see,” he said after a while. “Living in this half-dead town in the middle of nowhere. Where everything smells of dung and the chickens roam the streets. I had to…convince myself that I was different. That I was better than this place.” 

In front of the old man’s unseeing eyes, the fireflies danced above the water, spelling out letters in the darkness. Against the backdrop of the night sky, their reflections were lost amongst the stars. 

“Did you ever find someone like that, Sekharetta? Someone with that…magic in them?” 

The old man did not immediately reply. “No,” Sekharetta replied, “I never did.” For an instant a strange expression streaked across his face. It was gone in an instant. But the bearded man had caught it. 

Once when he was a little boy, Nasser had been taken to a *Kathakali* dance. He was around five at the time. At the end of the second act the man in the *Tati* mask had entered the stage - the troublemaker, the personification of evil. His lower face had been painted blood red, with fangs reaching to his chin. His eyes were two white globes in a background of jet black. His tongue kept darting in and out of his mouth, as if it were trying to smell the wind, like a snake. There was something fundamentally terrifying about that mask. As if it were a representation of hatred in its most primeval, unadulterated form. 

When Nasser saw the expression that flickered across his bearded friend’s face, he felt like that boy of five again. 

“I’ve been thinking,” said the bearded man suddenly, his face now composed. “How about a story?” 

“A story?” 

“Yes Sekharetta. A story. A night like this needs one. Or two.” 

The old man said nothing at first. He had always preferred to be the one talking. 

“Why not?” said Sekharetta at last, smiling. “But I hope you realise that Nasser and I are harsh critics.” 

*The first story* 

Hundreds of years ago, in a time very different from ours, there was a vast sea-faring nation whose capital was around these parts. 

Just a few decades ago a strong king had taken control over a tiny confederation of local cities and turned it into the dominant naval power in the area. He became a legend in his own time, the stories of his valour reaching the far corners of the world. The combination of his name and the size of his navy prompted neighbouring states to send dignitaries bent double with gifts to his court, to impress upon him the importance of mutually beneficial relationships. 

But one day a strange man from a country nobody had ever heard of walked into the king’s court carting a huge cage behind him. Inside it was an *apsara *– a celestial nymph. All who came within a yard of her would immediately feel their woes lifted off their shoulders, replaced by a lightness that made them feel like they could float. So impressed was the king by this gift, and angered by the sight of her in a cage, that he gave her a home in the sanctum sanctorum of a temple so that all could come and experience her magic for themselves. He felt in his bones that she was not someone to be possessed. 

But one day the *apsara* went missing. Later it was found at the home of a nobleman who had bribed half the guards of the temple and threatened the others with death in order to sneak in and steal away the *apsara*. At his trial, the king found the man guilty of the crime. However, right before the king could announce his punishment, the man screamed out loud that he had been blinded by her magic. He had felt an overwhelming urge to own her that he just could not control. He begged for a chance to repent. 

“You’re certainly keeping them short,” said Nasser with a smile. 

“The point isn’t the story itself. It’s what comes next.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“What, in your opinion, should the man’s sentence be?” asked the bearded man. 

“It’s simple enough,” said Sekharetta after a while. “He should be sentenced to death.” 

“That’s a bit harsh, don’t you think?” 

“I don’t think so. It’s the only punishment that would make sense. This wasn’t any old thing. It was an *apsara*.” 

“’She’.” 

“Yes, yes, that’s what I meant. Don’t be pedantic. Can I go on?” 

“Yes.” 

“Like I said, this was an *apsara* – very special indeed.” 

“And why does that change things?” 

“Its special nature increases its value. And the higher the value of an item, the stronger must be the deterrent against stealing it. Since the *apsara* is the very definition of *priceless*, the only appropriate deterrent harsh enough is the death sentence.” 

“Eloquently put,” said the bearded man. 

Nasser, who had seemed lost in contemplation until then, suddenly spoke up. 

“No,” he said. “That’s not right.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Sekharetta. 

“You can’t throw him under the bus like that. A man isn’t expendable for a greater good. An individual is special – the life given to him is a holy thing. And that means his ability to redeem himself must be taken seriously.” 

“So you’re saying…” 

“I’m saying the man has to be given a chance at redemption. A death sentence is not necessary, no matter how priceless the *apsara*.” 

Sekharetta laughed at his friend’s naiveté. “So what do you suggest we do with him?” 

“By all means send him to prison until his behaviour indicates a change of heart, a change of personality. But not death. I don’t believe any man – no matter how heinous his crime – can be so beyond redemption that death becomes appropriate.” 

The bearded man gave Nasser a long appraising look, then turned to his uncle. 

“What do you think of that, Sekharetta?” 

“It’s nonsense of course. Sentimental rubbish. If there’s a criminal out there who’s a significant threat you need to make an example out of him. Not acquit him in the belief that the rogue will somehow better himself.” 

He continued: “Fine. Let’s suppose there’s a chance that the man changes. But the risks so obviously outweigh any conceivable benefit! That *apsara *is one of a kind. It only needs to be stolen once to be lost forever. What are the chances a redeemed criminal could bring about even comparable value? Besides…let’s face it. Men don’t change.” 

There was a long silence as the bearded man considered what the two old men had said. There was a strange smile on his face. 

“I think you both have a point.” he declared at long last. “But I’ve got another one that I think you’ll like.” 

*The second story* 

Hundreds of years ago, in a time very different from ours, there was a vast sea-faring nation whose capital was around these parts. 

But while the kingdom could boast of having been ruled by various splendid kings throughout its history, its glory was certainly on the wane. While the tale of the king who had sacrificed his arm to save a peasant woman’s child, or that of the prince who had willingly sold his soul to an angry sage to save the lives of his subjects, were still told in market squares throughout the land, something was certainly changing. 

Of late their rulers had become increasingly out of touch with their subjects, refusing to understand their woes or proactively make their lives better. They were content to live in their golden palaces, completely isolated from reality. Or perhaps the confines of their rooms had become their reality, everything else outside of it irrelevant for their purposes. While mothers smothered their babies to save them from the pain of a slow death by starvation, the king and his queen dined on meat imported from foreign lands. While men were slaughtered for the tiniest slight by an evil noble class, the royal family read poetry to each other. On one of his rare excursions to the countryside, a girl took the king’s fancy. A tiny thing – not a day over seventeen. She was summoned to his chambers and was never seen again. 

One day, the inevitable happened. The people rose up in opposition, years of oppression giving an unnatural strength to their bony limbs. After seven days of furious fighting, the king’s army laid down their arms, horrified at having to murder their friends and family in cold blood. By the eighth day, the people had stormed the king’s palace and taken the royal family into their custody. 

However, on seeing the helpless family huddled around a fire, their eyes wide with fear, the rage seemed to leach out of the leader of the rebels. It felt wrong to go ahead with their plan – to slaughter the king and any potential heir. Instead, he threw them into their own prison and summoned an old judge famous for his objective sense of justice. A tribunal was set up to pass judgement on the fate of the royal family a week from then. Whether the king would be spared, or executed, depended on this judge’s decision. 

“How would you decide if you were the judge?” 

The two old men pondered this in silence for a while. Nasser was the first to speak. 

“The king was guilty.” 

Nasser proceeded to explain his point of view. A person in a position of power should be held to higher standards than other people. While refusing to help his poor neighbour cannot morally inculpate an ordinary citizen – since no man could be punished for not being a Good Samaritan – the king as a public authority was bound by different rules. For a man in his position, he had a duty to act to ease the suffering of his people. Every consequence of his refusal to act – including the deaths of his subjects - was therefore his fault. The king deserved to be executed. 

“I disagree,” said Sekharetta at the end of Nasser’s monologue. 

“You do?” asked the bearded man. 

“I feel the entire premise is flawed. Nasser’s thinking like a lawyer here. He treats the king almost as if he had made a contract with his subjects.” 

“But hasn’t he, though?” asked Nasser. “The king enjoys the privileges of a monarch, and in return he needs to protect and provide for those who gave him that power in the first place.” 

Sekharetta laughed. “There probably isn’t a single man in that kingdom who wouldn’t trade places with the king if given the choice. If it truly was a bargain struck between the people and the monarch, then the members of the former would not desperately want to be the latter. If you gave five rupees to the milkman in return for a carton of milk, would either of you want to be in the other’s shoes? You wouldn’t – because you each feel you got what you wanted. That’s the mark of a real bargain.” 

“So what you’re saying is…” 

“I’m saying the king is king because his ancestors were strong enough to seize that power. And you don’t make bargains with people you control anyway. The king owed no responsibility to his citizens. There was no bargain. That idea probably cropped up as a lie to keep the masses in control.” 

There was silence. 

“But it’s not all about obligations and bargains,” said Nasser. “Surely you think it’s *morally* wrong for the king to just sit there and do nothing while his subjects died? Surely it went against God?” 

“If you go to Saudi you’ll meet a bunch of imams who will tell you it’s morally wrong to apostatise. But if you travel a few thousand kilometres further to the west you’ll meet another group of people who’ll tell you the opposite. Who’s right?” 

Nasser had no answer. 

“The truth of the matter is, morals change from place to place and time to time. In other words, it is too arbitrary a metric for our judge to use. Before the revolution it probably would have been morally wrong to revolt against the king, and whatever the king did was probably morally right. After all he’s God’s representative on earth. To preserve any semblance of objectivity, the judge has to stick to the realm of bargains.” 

The nephew had been watching his uncle intently, his face expressionless. 

“What about the girl?” asked the bearded man. “Let’s face it. The king probably killed her after he had his way with her.” 

“It doesn’t change anything,” said Sekharetta. “It is ‘wrong’ for a murderer to kill someone only because he will be punished by the law. In other words, the ‘wrongness’ derives from the expectation of a penalty. A sanction. The king obviously did not need to fear any such sanction – he was the one who issued the sanctions. Hence he did nothing wrong.” 

A smile broke out across the bearded man’s face, a smile that made Nasser shiver involuntarily. 

“I can’t argue with your logic,” he said, “But either way, it doesn’t help the king here.” 

“What do you mean?” asked Sekharetta. “The judge will have to let him go since he didn’t do anything wrong. That’s what you said.” 

“But you threw out the rule book. You’ve stripped away every code of ethics that the judge could possibly use and only left behind the idea that the strong dictate what is right or wrong. If that’s the only principle in play here, there isn’t any reason – moral or otherwise - why the rebels can’t renege on their promise and cut open the throats of the king and his family. You’ve established that whatever was holding back the rebel leader was only an irrational feeling, a dying echo of that lie that kept the masses in control.” 

Sekharetta burst out into laughter. Nasser for some reason, looked nervous. 

“You win,” said Sekharetta. “Give us another one. I’m enjoying myself.” 

“I…I think I might leave actually,” said Nasser. “It’s getting very late.” 

“Just one more,” said the bearded man. “I think you’ll like this one. A tragic tale of two lovers.” 

“Oh stay, Nasser,” said Sekharetta. “It’s not like you’ve got much to do at home anyway.” 

“No…I think I might leave all the same,” said Nasser, beginning to get up. 

“Nasser * etta*,” said the bearded man. “Stay.” 

And so he did. 

*The third story* 

Hundreds of years ago, in a time very different from ours, there was a vast sea-faring nation whose capital was around these parts. 

Its citizens were famed sailors and had mastered the art of navigating and fighting in the sea. They would sail to far flung parts of the world only to return with stories of the marvels and strange sights that they had witnessed. They would also bring back captives to work the land and fight their wars. 

The nation had long ago thrown off the yoke of an oppressive monarchy in favour a land run by its people. But such things rarely turn out the way they are expected. Local chieftains called *thampurans *cropped up all over the place and where before there was one king, there were now many. One particular *thampuran* was extremely fond of the arts. He gave most of his duties to his steward – a man he had known since they were both children – and spent his time composing poems and acting in plays. He seemed to be searching desperately for something, but no one could ever understand what he was talking about when they asked him about it. Something about 

The *thampuran* also had a son who admired him deeply. He shared his father’s admiration for the arts. He could act, sing, dance and compose soulful melodies almost as well as his father. But he knew that there was no comparison. In his eyes his father was a towering column of fire, to be admired but impossible to emulate. 

One day in the summer of his sixteenth year, the young prince walked into the city market to see a huge crowd blocking his way. Some spectacle had so enraptured some of them that they had forgotten all about minding their shops. On noticing the royal retinue, the crowd parted until the prince could see what the commotion was all about. 

In the square was a woman in chains. This in itself was nothing remarkable. But as they got closer the prince realised she was certainly not from these parts. She was pale skinned and small nosed, with long wavy hair. And her eyes were strange – shaped almost like almonds. Everybody knew of the existence of a strange land beyond the sea, where it rained in the afternoon every day, populated by a people who looked like this. But what had drawn in the crowd was her singing. And what a voice she had. The prince could understand none of it, but that did not matter. 

The woman stopped singing when she noticed him. She looked at him with a frank expression. Despite being torn from her homeland, shackled, and sent to a strange nation with strange looking people, she was not broken. Her face was splattered with the remains of some vegetable someone in the crowd had thrown at her. Yet there was no fear in her eyes. 

Days later the prince realised that the woman had lodged herself firmly in his head. He did not understand why. She certainly was not pretty – at least, she looked too different to say if she was. But there was some unexplainable quality that completely captivated him - something extremely intelligent in her gaze. But he realised that this was a dangerous feeling for someone of his stature. He promised himself that he would not look for her. But that was a promise he was only too glad to break when he found out – to his surprise – that she worked in the palace gardens. 

Without intending to at the start, the prince began to spend time with her. And in that time the prince realised that she was by far the cleverest person he had ever met – even cleverer than himself. She asked questions he had never thought of and found something funny in everything. Her frame of mind was infectious and the prince caught it. Slowly but surely, he began to question the things he had been brought up with. The received wisdom that was so obviously true before, suddenly was not. Where everybody else saw a smooth surface unmarred by imperfections, the prince began to notice cracks. 

And after a few weeks in her company he could not remember why he had ever found her anything but pretty. She did not look like them, but that would be like chastising the sunflower for not looking like the lotus. 

He asked her what her name was in her tongue. It stood for the moon. And after she laughed at all his attempts to say it, he just began to call her Moon. His own name stood for the sun, so he felt that they were meant to be. In a year they were in love. They spent every night in each other’s arms – the prince had long ago chosen not to think of the consequences. And every day after was a happy one. 

“What’s the matter?” asked the bearded man. “Don’t you like this one? You both look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

There was no reply. 

“It gets better. Trust me.” 

There was something very special about Moon. The prince had grown up listening to countless musicians, singers and bards in the *thampuran*’s court. Some of them mediocre, some pleasant, and others genuinely stunning. But none of them compared to the way Moon sounded when she was happy or overtaken by some grand emotion. It was even frightening in a way. It made the prince think of magic - of the stories of *apsaras *and *gandharvas *that he had grown up with. It made him think he finally understood what the *thampuran *meant when he rambled on about catching glimpses of God in people. 

One night, exactly a year since the day they had first met, she sang a special song to him. A strange, sad melody with words he did not understand. But it was the most beautiful thing he had ever heard. It tugged at something deep inside him. It made him want to crawl out of his body and take flight. It made him think of a light – a light that everything was part of. A light that he felt was close enough to touch, but was yet tantalisingly out of reach. Perhaps if he stretched he would make it. 

But the song had stopped. There were two figures at the door, staring at Moon in shocked silence. It was the *thampuran* and his steward. There was no rage or anger on the former’s face. Instead he wore a strange, serene expression, the corners of his mouth tugged down. For some reason this terrified the prince more than unadulterated fury would have. It was the expression the court shamans wore in the middle of a religious paroxysm. 

The *thampuran* flicked his hand. Guards entered the room and took the prince away, his screams and struggles barely slowing them down. The steward just stood there, watching. He opened his mouth as if to protest, but then thought better of it. The guards hit the prince on the head with something hard. The last thing he saw before blacking out was his father climbing onto his bed. And the last thing he heard were Moon’s screams. 

The bearded man had stopped. Tears glistened on his face, and his eyes were far, far away. 

The two old men were staring in fright at their young companion. The blood had completely drained from their faces. Sekharetta scrabbled around desperately for his walking cane, but his nephew got up and kicked it out of his reach. 

The bearded man stood in front of his uncle and looked straight into the old man’s blind eyes. He suddenly started speaking again, softly but clearly. 

When he came to, the prince was tied to a chair. Sitting on his haunches in front of him was the *thampuran*. His cronies had disappeared. 

“Sekharetta?” I asked the *thampuran *groggily, trying to move my arms and failing. “Why…why are you doing this?” 

Sekharetta seemed to consider this question for a while. 

“I’m not entirely sure,” he replied. “One thing led to another, and now you’re here tied to a chair, with your uncle in front of you, begging for your help.” 

“My…help?” 

“Yes. You see, that friend of yours I found in your room? Chandri, was it? She sort of…passed out, in the middle and now she won’t wake up.” 

I said nothing. I could say nothing. 

“After a bit of thinking I figured the smartest thing I could do is blame you,” said Sekharetta, his sharp eyes boring into mine. As if reciting from a memorised list, he continued: “Every man and woman in the village knows you spend all your time in the gardens with her. And they know I’d never go within a yard of a *Paanan *girl. Usually. What else? You’re a fatherless troublemaker – always running off into the forest to do God knows what. Oh, and everyone’s gone off to the train station to send Siddhu off so there aren’t any witnesses.” 

He smiled brightly at me, as if expecting me to congratulate him. I felt too dazed to cry. How had I never noticed that this man was insane? 

“Why…..just tell me why? Please. Why…why would you do this?” 

The smile left Sekharetta’s face slowly and he seemed a bit uncertain as he spoke. 

“I’m…not sure? I thought I found something in your friend. When I heard her singing. Something I’d been searching a long time for.” He stopped, then continued: “And I just had to have it, you see? When you’ve wanted something for so long, and it turns up so unexpectedly, you need to have it. And… it was just so easy. That girl barely weighed a kilo.” 

“And I’m sorry to be doing this to you,” he told his nephew. “I sincerely am. I’ve always liked you, boy. But in these situations it’s every man for himself. I’d be stupid *not *to try and protect myself when I so easily can, you understand?” 

I said nothing. 

“I hope you do. It’d be a shame to leave this world without understanding that one basic truth.” 

Sekharetta got up to leave and looked at me one last time. “Well, I’ve got no stomach for this stuff. I’ll leave you with your uncle Nasser. He’s good at this sort of thing.” And he left, closing the door behind him. 

The steward – Nasser - stepped out of the darkness, carrying a large butcher’s knife in his right hand. His face seemed naked without the kindly smile it usually wore. 

He began to walk towards me. It was too strange a scene for it to register. This man had bought me candy not so long ago. But he stopped suddenly, and stared at me for what seemed like a very long time. Something seemed to change in his eyes. Where there had been grim determination, there was now…sadness. He put away the knife. He closed his hand into a fist and brought it crashing down on my temple. 

“You fool,” sobbed Sekharetta. He seemed to have trouble breathing. “Nasser. You fool.” 

Nasser barely heard him. He stared transfixed at Aditya, as if trying to find that young boy of seventeen in the bearded man’s weathered face. 

Aditya got down on his haunches and cocked his head at the two old men in front of him. He considered them for a long while before he spoke. 

“The prince wandered for a long time, knowing he couldn’t go back home. Not yet anyway. Why, you might ask? The prince wasn’t entirely sure himself. Perhaps it was because he didn’t know what to do with his uncles when he found them. One had brought him up, and the other had spared his life. One had committed the crime, while the other merely refrained from stopping it. Or perhaps it was because even after all these years he didn’t understand why….no… *how* they could have done what they had.” 

Aditya got up and slowly walked around the pool, staring at the unbroken water – so calm, so peaceful. So different from how he felt. 

“He finally came to the conclusion that the civil thing to do was… well, just ask them what he should do. So that’s what he did. And they gave their answers so enthusiastically that he wondered why he hadn’t thought of this years before. Everything was suddenly crystal clear.” 

From the other end of the pool, he looked up and across the water at Sekharetta. “Well, the tale’s ended and now we come to the interesting part. What, dear uncles, would you do if you were the prince?” 

A man lay in the mud, blood gushing out of his slit throat. He was alone in a vast rice field, bright moonlight illuminating him. Fireflies swarmed around him, but his blind eyes could not see them. Perhaps it made no difference, for the man had never learnt how to treat beautiful things. It was unfortunate, since he had spent his entire life in search of them. But he could hear a flute, playing a tune he recognised. The sound of the flute grew nearer, until he could sense a figure standing right in front of him. The man knew the figure would be dressed in rags, wearing a shift so faded it would be impossible to tell how it had originally looked like. 

*Gauri*, the man wanted to say, but couldn’t. *I am so… so sorry. Help me. * 

The figure turned around and left. The music of her flute grew fainter and fainter until finally, it had gone completely.
