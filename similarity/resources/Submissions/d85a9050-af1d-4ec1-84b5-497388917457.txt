Diwali night in the great metal birdcage in the sky – it was far more preferable to gaze upon the pyrotechnics from above without having to suffer any of the bluster that was inevitable with proximity.

She was neither at her father's house, where she had been, nor at University, where she was going to be. She could safely be mesmerised by the thousands of great fiery blossoms bursting in the sky, fading, and blossoming again.

From the subdued plane journey to the quick ride on the black-and-yellow taxi, during which she dispatched with phone calls from both Som and her father with equal felicity, smoothly lying to both men. Yes, Pappa, somebody has come to pick me up. Yes, Som, I will call you after I clean my room and take a shower. All the while, she was acutely aware of the beating, beating of her heart, finally impatient after the restraint she had exercised in the last few days at home, thinking only of the small secret box in her suitcase.

She shed her earrings as soon as she pushed into her dear, dusty room. The hostel corridor was quiet, but not wanting to invite attention just in case one of her neighbours returned, she lit a solitary lamp. She threw the small blue suitcase on the floor, scattering its contents willy-nilly, before emerging with the battered box she had found in her father's room. One glance inside it had revealed to her that it had belonged to her mother, who had been gone now for over thirteen years. Her father's vague explanations of her sudden death - there one day and gone the next – which had once sufficed for the little girl were no longer enough for the young woman. She was tenacious enough to try to prise out the truth from the reluctant jaws of the past. She opened the box.

That picture again, the one that had confirmed to her that these were her mother's things. It was, unmistakably, her mother as a young woman, though she had never seen her looking like this. Nothing clouded her mother's expression in this picture, as it always had in others, and in her hazy childhood memories. She had on a thin chiffon sari, its floral motif lovely against its stark black base. She sat at a desk, next to a small transistor, and gazed into the camera boldly, even coquettishly.

Nobody in her paternal family – aunts, grandmother, uncles, her father – would say anything about her except that she had a dreadful temper, which had eventually driven her to madness. Her mother's side of the family had been lost to her the same time as her mother herself was – she had never seen or heard from them again. But the fact that her mother surely must have been a great aesthete cut through the thickening silence of the years. It was evident in every nook of the house that she had decorated. It was evident in the objects in this box – the sumptuously painted bookmark, the antique silver earrings, the notebook with its unusual rust jacket. She opened this last, and a sheaf of papers fell out of its creamy pages.

It was a letter. A strange pain pierced her heart. She had never seen her mother's handwriting before. Just then, her phone rang. Som again. He had already left several messages. She switched it off, turned her back to it, and began to read:

*Dear Mani,*

*It has been a while since I heard from you. They have not been allowing me to call home or send letters, but I'm going to write this anyway. I don't know how much longer I can stand it, or why Pappa ever sent me to this hellhole of a city. There are only a few things forcing me to cling to life: my stories, the memory of you, and Baby, who depends on me for so much. They found my old notebook last week and took it away. It was better when they laughed. I can't write any more, they said. I must write. Remember that story we started to make up that Navratri before I was married? I have finished it. I am sending it to you, in the hopes that it will mean something to you. I love you, my darling sister, and I remember you everyday.*

*Yours,* *Amba*

*Wrath*

*By the time you read this tale, it is possible that all of us will be dead. And although it is difficult for me to live any kind of normal life, because I have not been able to sleep properly for many weeks, I must tell you of the extraordinary events that changed our lives forever. But proceed on with caution, dear reader, for this tale may give you a sleepless night of your own.*

*Although we were respected around the town, and we never lacked for wealth, it was a matter of shame for our father to have an unmarried woman in the house. But my older sister Maya had created a scene every time a suitor had come to see her – dropping cups of tea deliberately, responding to questions rudely, and once, even running away right before the prospective groom and his family were expected. The beatings were brutal, and Pappa also forbade anyone to feed her on these days, but these had no effect and eventually even he had to give up. But he kept up a steady stream of abuse ready for her, because she was the one failure he could not hide from the world.*

*Then one day Mataji came to her. All the neighbours came to watch her as she thrashed on the ground, and spoke in a voice that was entirely different from her own. Mummy scrambled to offer her fruits and sweets, and then all the women asked her what the Goddess wanted. At this, she looked straight at Pappa and laughed and laughed. He fell to her feet. *

*We had seen this before, of course. The Goddess had come to Madhuben next door, but that had only lasted for less than half an hour, after which she had collapsed and could not remember anything she had said while the Goddess was in her. But three hours later, Maya was still speaking in that powerful voice. She had run out of the house for fifteen minutes, but nobody dared follow her, or say anything to her when she walked back. Three more hours passed, until Mummy, crying from bewilderment, asked her again what she wanted. *

*‘Him! I want him to confess what he does to his daughter when no one else is home!’ she boomed, pointing straight at Pappa. He turned around and bolted, followed by her crow-like laughter. *

*Mummy and I spent that night in terror. She kept crying and crying. Maya sat in a corner, eyes wide open. She did not speak except to say, ‘Him! Bring me his head! Bring me his head! Bring me his head!’ The next morning, when I went to fetch milk for mummy, I heard the neighbours talking about that Ramneekbhai and his crazy daughter Maya who had been visited by Mataji. *

*That afternoon, Pappa returned with a priest. He said that it was not the Goddess, but a demoness that had visited my sister, and that we had better get out the way while he took care of it. Then he pushed Mummy out of the house and threw me out after her. He locked the door, which Mummy beat and beat her fists on. I don’t know what they did inside but I could hear Maya’s new voice screaming. The neighbours stood around and watched. When they finally opened the door, I saw Maya bruised all over, like she had been every time she forced a suitor to reject her. *

*But what I saw frightened me more than it ever had before, because she wasn’t crying. She had a terrible smile on her face, and when she saw me, she screamed, ‘His head! Bring me his head, his head, his head!’ And then she laughed and laughed, and I wanted to run away, but Mummy held my hand so hard I thought it was going to break. She called out to Pappa, but he had already gone.*

*The next morning he brought the doctors. Mummy screamed but he didn’t listen. Finally he slapped Mummy, and when I cried he slapped me too. The doctors took Maya away. She went with the greatest dignity I have ever seen a human being muster, and I thought whatever spirit had come to her had left her, but just as they were about to shut the door to the van, she screamed in that voice again, ‘I will not leave this house until you bring me his head!’*

*That night, Mummy and I cowered while Pappa ignored us. When he finally switched the lights off, a familiar booming voice filled the house. ‘Ramneek! Ramneek! Him! Him! Him! Bring me his head! His head! His head!’ *

*I thought it was only me. But the lights came on, and Pappa stood against a wall, looking like he was going to be sick. Mummy’s eyes were huge with terror. *

*And so it has been every night since. She will not leave this house until her will is done. Now that I have told you our story, I must go. I owe the spirit an offering. *

She clutched the letter, sank down in her bed and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, her room seemed different. Smaller. She couldn’t breathe. She threw open the doors: first to the balcony, then to the corridors, which were still quiet. There was only the distant boom of outside, and the humming in her head. She caught herself reflected in the mirror. Her mother’s dark brown eyes stared back.

‘Avni! What is wrong with your phone? I’ve been calling forever.’

Som was at the threshold.

For the first time in all the time she had known this man, she did not want him in the same room as her.

‘What’s happened to you? Are you ok?’

She nodded, not trusting herself to speak, knowing that she could not express herself in this moment, knowing that any response from him would seem inadequate even if she could.

He took a step closer. He was wearing a light green kurta and jeans. His hair was ruffled. He looked as though she had known and loved him years ago. He was going to hug her. She turned away and got herself a glass of water.

‘Everyone’s waiting for you. Come on!’

Everyone: all her friends who made up her life at University, to whom she was fiercely devoted. This life, to which she had come running two years ago. Where she had learned so much about the world. And this man before her, so unlike her, so sure of his place in the scheme of things, so beloved by everyone.

She had loved it dearly: the classes, the warmth of their friendships, the passion of the political work, the music and the parties and the books.

She had loved it all – even the pettiness, even the hypocrisies – but she had also needed it like a drowning woman needs a raft. She had loved it while never once feeling like she had a right to be part of it, always hiding from the dark bird that swooped around her, while she hid in the beautiful clamour.

‘Avni, let’s go!’

All of it flashed before her: the gatherings and rallies and classes and meetings. She had never once refused to be part of things, even when she had been exhausted or sick or overwhelmed. She had been afraid of the woman with the dark eyes.

She meant to say she had reading to do, to make an excuse. But what she said instead was, ‘Sorry Som, I can’t come tonight. I have to write.’
