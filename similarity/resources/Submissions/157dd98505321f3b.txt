*O My Soul’s Mate* 

Rashik was, what we call, a dumbo. He was frail and mentally a derelict. He had no specific intellectual abilities, nor was he a dexterous worker. He was,  if we are allowed to we may say, a non-human in the garb of human. But Rashik could put in a lot of physical labour.  He could really work his tail off. His devils’ labour sometimes resulted in seeping of a soapy fizz out of the corner his mouth. 

Ramanath had seen enough of life. He had reflected much on this Rashik, and had finally come to the decision that Rashik could best be compared to the cows he kept in his shed. 

But since ‘a son of a cow’ made no strong sense as an abuse Ramanath preferred to call him ‘a son of a bitch’. He poured out all the abuses he knew on Rashik.  Rashik in reply only smiled with all his teeth out. After Ramanath finished with his abuses Rashik limped slowly back into his room. His left leg was one –and- a- half- inch shorter than his right one since his birth. 

When Rashik was only two years old , his widowed mother Raikishori had joined the Thakurpath Bhattacharjee house as a maid, carrying little Rashik against her flank. 

Ramanath went back thinking on the days he had passed out his School Final from Bairatiguri High School. He had failed once in class IX and was not allowed to sit in the Test Examination once. That made him 18 when he passed class X. Ramanath calculated. He was now 51. Rashik should be 35. Ramanath used to call Rashik’s mother ‘Khuri’. ‘Raikhuri’. 

Since Raikhuri’s death, three years ago, Rashik lived alone in the room that stood leaning against the boundary wall with its three bamboo walls and a thatched roof. There stood three rooms in a row. In the other two lived two labours who worked on his farm - one Nagen Roy, the other, Banga Barman.  None of them were, however, as stupid as Rashik. Rather a shrewd and a wicked lot. Matching tune with their *malik** they also called Rashik names, called him cow and donkey. Rashik always ate the humble pie. He only smiled back. All three of them ate their meals at Ramanath’s house. Nanda, his cook , made them sit  in the corner of the verandah and served them food. 

Though it is true that nothing called *Jothdaar- *the lords of extensive agricultural farms- are left now, and *Barga* is a practice existing only in Government files, but Ramanath  still remained  a *Jothdaar*. All land reforms, *Barga* etc. weree defeated here at Bhattacharjee’s house. The old residents of Thakurpath still called him *Jothdarbabu*. They respected him as a landlord even now. One was  awestruck at the lands he had in Thakurpath, Gilandi, Deomali . But he had to sell off twenty- two *bighas* of land near Sakoajhora and Dhiren’s shop for his son. He sent him to Bangalore for MBA. Rajatsubhro now serves in a multinational company there. Father and son had a great squabble on the subject when he visited them before the Viswakarma Puja. 

-You joined work without letting me know. How could you do that? 

-Got selected in campusing. How could I let the opportunity go? 

-You don’t need to work. I still have 50 bighas of land here. 

- Why did you enroll me to MBA then? 

- That was only for the degree. So that people respect you here. 

-Does anybody let go a job of forty- thousand? In this period of economic crisis? 

- I will give you an allowance of fifty thousand per month. Come back here. There is no economic crisis in Thakurpath. 

-What shall I do here? Plough?  Quarrel with potato sellers of Dhupguri over rates of potatoes? 

-That’s what you are supposed to do. Who will look after all this land? 

-You take care of your property. Or else sell them off. Do not drag me into this. Uff I feel so suffocated here at Thakurpath. Pools everywhere stinking with rets of jute. I feel nauseating. 

-Those are not rets of jute. They are rets of money. The smell of money makes you vomit? 

-Yes .The stink of money at Thakurpath makes me vomit. 

Rajat went off. But he also did some good. He took his mother along. A month passed. Rajat had been very busy. He did not know for certain when he could bring his mother back. Anuradha had called up. 

-Look what a problem I am into. Babu brought me here saying that it would be just for fifteen days, and, now how I am stuck. 

– Stay with your Babu for few more days. *Bechara*,* he’s so alone there. 

- That’s true. But you are alone too at Thakurpath. 

--*Aare,* here we have Nanda to cook for us. Here’s Nagen, Banga. And your favorite Rashik also. 

-Do you take your pressure medicines regularly? 

-Yes,  very punctually. Don’t you worry. 

-Then I think I will stay back for the winter. 

-Absolutely. Do not worry at all. Call up whenever you feel bad. You son earns forty thousand. You can call at your will. 

The Pujas are early this year. It is  Autumn now. But it isn’t cold at all. There is  a slight nip in the air during the night. One was compelled to switch the fan off. To look at least for a bed sheet to cover up. But the heat that Noorjahan emanated from her thirty -year old -body has no comparison. It gave a creepy kind of feeling. 

Replacing the receiver on its cradle Ramanath climbed on to the terrace. The terrace was over the second floor. One could see till a distance from there. As far as the eyes traveled, all were Bhattacharjee’s land. Rows of potato plants. The geometrical greenery pleased the eye. This year the rates of potatoes were sky high. The way the potato plants were slinking up in Ramanath’s farm, it could be foretold that the year would  see a good harvest. Nagen and Banga were spraying pesticides in the potato farm. They had tied *gamcha* *around their neck to cover their nose. The land touching Bhattacharjee’s wall had a thin stretch of betel nut orchard. Perched under a betel nut tree Rashik was singing unmindfully— 

*Neel dariyar majhi re ,* 

*kul gheshiya jao re,* 

*sabdhane,sabdhane baiyo nao* 

[boatsman of the blue sea , 

row your boat close to the shore, 

carefully, carefully row your boat] 

Only the stupid Rasik knew where he could find a blue ocean amidst the dry beetle nuts. Thank god, today he was not singing that *Paran bondhu re, dao dekha daya kore*. [O my soul’s mate, reveal thyself to me…] He sang it so often that he had spoilt the charm of the song.  Ramanath had reproached him once or twice -“Stop this song of yours. It boils my blood. When you have so many numbers in your warehouse why do you harp on the same tune like a house myna? ” Rashik had digested the reproach and replied – 

“ This is my most favorite song K*arta*.” * 

But one had to admit that Rashik sang only too well. He was an illiterate, an idiot, but he had a very sharp memory. Singing came to him naturally. He could learn all the lyrics by heart only by listening to them. He could memorize all songs just by listening.  He listened to Pabanbaul at Dhiren’s shop, to  Khagen Adhikary of Magurmari and  Dayal Mondal of Noonkhoaya and had picked up all. Thus he had *Bhatiyali*, *Kirtan*, *Baulanga*, *Jari- Jikir*, and also some *Goyalpariya* * in his collection. He had earned quite a name. He got regular invitations at Thakurpath in occasions like Narayan Puja, death rituals, rice ceremony, and Kirtan. 

Ashu Dutta, the manager of Thakurpath Jatra Samaj, had requested Rashik to play the role of Conscience in his *Rahim Badshah Rupbaan Kanya*. Rashik refused. Ramanath asked him –“Why did you refuse? It was a good opportunity. So many people come to see Jatra, think of that. You could have become a hero Rashik.” 

Rashik hung his head down abashed – “ No *Kartababu* , that is troublesome. If Conscience climbs on stage limping, spectators will throw stones. It is better to sing Kirtan. I don’t have to appear on stage. I can sing off-stage sitting on a Tarpaulin.” 

Ramanath had for once felt that Rashik wasn’t  so much of a cow that he had taken him to be. 

Ramanath called out for Rashik form the terrace ‘Rashik. Aaaai Rashik.’ 

-Yes. 

-Go and call Puron. Tell him I have to go to Gilandi. 

-Right *Karta*. 

Rashik stopped his song and limped towards the main road to call Puron. 

Puron Dahal, Ramanath’s driver, lived across the road in a slum. The night would be cold it seemed. Ramanath would go to Gilandi today. He would spend the night there. Aradhana was not home. Who would care about his whereabouts? His son had done a service to him in a way by taking his mother along with him to Bangalore. Not only this winter, if Aradhana decided to stay with her son lifelong Ramanath would only be salvaged. 

Puron was  the son of a Brahmin priest. He used to study in Thakurpath High school. To   maintain the family status Ramanath had to be enrolled in Bairatiguri High school. Since they were of the same age, whatever schools they studied in, they became great friends. They would meet in the playground. Puron was a great goalkeeper. He had played in Bhutan Gold Cup in Phuentsholing. When Ramanath purchased his car, Puorn was a bus driver on Hantupara –Jalpaiguri route. Ramanath  told Puron –“When you are into driving, why don’t you drive my car. We two friends can do some chatting when we go somewhere.” For twenty-five long years since then Puron had been a companion to many of his misdeeds. 

Ramanath got ready and sat on the sofa in his verandah. He found Puron entering the garage. He looked older than his years. His white skin had turned copperish. He has also turned 51. Last winter he married his daughter off to Gangutia Tea Garden. Ramanath had advised –“ If the boy is good go ahead with the wedding Puron. Your daughter is my daughter. Do not worry about money”. True to his word, Ramanath had spent without count.  He spent 1.5 Lacs in Puron’s daughter’s wedding. Puron had not expected that much. After that day Puron’s shoulders wore a hunch of acknowledgement. He could not speak to him looking straight into his eyes. Ramanath stood up and called Nanda — “I will not return tonight. I have a meeting. Ask Rashik to sleep in the drawing room. Lock all the doors and windows properly.” Nanda nodded her head . 

As Puron took the car out Ramanath went and sat beside him. As the car crossed the main gate he saw Rashik limping towards the house. Ramanath signaled to Puron to stop the car, craned his neck out of the window and called  “Rashik …Rashik…listen!” 

-Yes *Karta.* 

-  I will not come back tonight. Lock your room and sleep in the drawing room. 

-I will. 

-See to it that Nagen and Banga have early dinner and go off. Watch out that Nagen and Banga do not make advances towards Nanda. 

-No they won’t. Remain in peace. 

-And you too. Do not begin discussing your philosophy of physiology with Nanda in the drawing room. 

Rashik stuck out his tongue. He  hung his head down. 

Puron sped the car towards the main road and asked, “Right or left?” 

-Left, left. I still am a leftist. Everything has not changed colours. Let the elections be over. Then I shall turn right. 

Ramanath thought that he had been really witty. He giggled.  Puron understood  that Ramanath will go to Gilandi at Noorjahan’s house. 

Bhattacharjee had five *bighas *of land beside Gildani river. Nuruddin Ali was employed to look after it. Nuruddin was now over 80. Decrepit. His son Fakiruddin used to cultivate the land.  Fakiruddin was murdered last year. It was a political murder stemming from local village politics. Noorjahan is Fakru’s second wife. After Fakru‘s death old and grief stricken Nuruddin  had requested Ramanath not to evict them from the land. How could Ramanath evict? Sitting on a barkless wicker stool he had been  watching a mermaid emerge out of Gilandi river. So long he would visit only Fakru’s aubergine farm. He would look at the healthy aubergines and appreciate Fakru’s knowledge of farming. But he had no knowledge that Fakru had kept a mermaid hidden in his hut. Ramanath was a genius in persuasion. But what else could be done without being persuaded? Where to stay? What to eat? Since that day, the aubergine farm gradually filled with weeds. All the ploughing took place inside Fakru’s hut. Old, decrepit Nuruddin  sat in his room and sucked at chicken legs with Puron. He could not chew. He has no teeth left. He never used to drink before but now he took two glasses from Puron, spread his legs and went off to sleep. He was enjoying life just because Fakru’s wife was pretty. Old Nuruddin understood that it was more dignified to drink two glasses and be sloshed rather then look into the drollery that the wife of his dead son indulged in. When he was back he found  himself  lying shapeless on his bed. Birds  chirping. The sun coming in through the open door. Then he found it difficult to accept  himself as a Muslim. 

But Noorjahan loved and respected her old and infirm father-in-law. Her earnest attention was almost faultless. The day after Fakru’s murder Nuruddin tightly held on to Noor and cried –“My son is gone. You do not throw me out. Where will I go in this age ? I won’t even be able to go begging.” 

Noor had not thrown him out. In fact she attended to his needs more than before. 

Revered him more than her own father. To tell the truth, Noor had given herself up to Ramanath in order to save her old and infirm father-in- law. She did not know why a sorrow welled up within her whenever she looked at that skeletal old man. For so many years he had kept the Bhattacharjee’s land green, breathing and meaningful. Today he did not have the capacity to work. His head reeled if he went out in the sun, if he got wet in the rain he had breathing trouble. If she had not accepted Bhattacharjee’s adulterous  proposal they would be thrown out of their homestead. Thank god she had that graceful desirable body!  It was evident that her old father –in-law could not accept this immorality . It was evident from his taking to drinking at this age. Nuruddin who once thought himself to be a true Muslim now he drank country liquor to remain oblivious of the love –making moans that he sometimes heard at night. 

But everything had changed now. Although it seemed quite a burden in the beginning, she now enjoyed her physical contact with Bhattacharjee. She also felt an attraction, but she could comprehend that it is not of the soul. But one could not deny the body. Bhattacharjee also liked Noor. Or else would one spend so much just to spend 5-6 nights every month?  Last week when Bhattacharjee came on his visit, Noor was running a high temperature. The man did not do anything. Rather he sent Puron to Angrabhasa to fetch medicines form Kalu doctor. At night he caressed her touching her lightly on her forehead. Noor attempted to open her sari. Bhattacharjee said- “Are you mad? Am I an animal? Sleep off quietly.” After taking the tablet Noor’ s temperature went down. She did not know when she drifted off . She woke up at dawn to find  Bhattacharjee sleeping beside her, a little shrunken. Noor pulled the blanket upto his neck.  A little light slinked in through the window. In that enchanting light she looked at Bhattacharjee’s face. It wasn’t so impure after all. 

Noor walked out of the room. Her father-in-law’s door was already open. She could see Puron lying prostrate on the bed. The red car near the gate was sopping with dew. Towards the farm behind the house, Nuruddin sat basking in the sun on a big rock under the *shefali* tree. That was his favourite spot. Abundant *shefali* flowers had fallen on the ground. An intoxicating fragrance emanated from them. In his white cap ,brick –coloured shawl and checkered lungi the fair  Nuruddin looked as if  he had come down form the sky along with the sun rays. The old man would climb back to heaven one day with the help of the sunrays . 

--Is your fever down? Did you have the tablet? 

-Yes, down. Did you not sleep Abba? 

- You were running temperature. How could I sleep? I was worried. Come here. Sit for a while. It is suddenly winter. 

Noor sat beside her father- in- law covering her head with her shawl ,a little curled up. 

-You have so much of problem because of me Noor. If I would die you could live in peace. I will not even find a place in hell. I sell you for my living. 

Noor listened to such babble everyday. It had no effect on her. She did not reply. She picked up some s*hefali* flowers from the ground. Was it so easy to die?  So much of disease, self-deception, oppression --- yet life seemed to have a beauty of its own .Even now when the *shefali* flowers bloom it feels like *Id* time. 

-The flowers are so beautiful, aren’t they *Abba*? 

-There’s nothing as beautiful as you. But what a value of this beauty! 

Nuruddin sighed. He was asthmatic. His breath trembled. 

Noor did not reply even to this. She touched the flowers  one by one and said  “Bhattacharjee wants to get me married …are you listening?” 

-Haa. I know, with Rasik isn’t it?  I know that chap since his childhood. A very good human. Allah has poured all his melody onto him. 

- I heard that he’s lame , he’s an idiot. 

--Yes ,Yes, I know everything. But he has melody. There is magic in his voice. 

- Have you heard him singing? 

-Yes, I have. Many times. He also knows *Jari-Jikir.* 

Nuruddin began humming--- 

*Prem jane na rasik kalachand o mor jhuriya thake mon * 

*Katodine bondhur sone habo darishon * 

*Mor mon urau parng kore * 

*Bhador mashi deoyor jhobi tappas ki tuppush ki jhamjhamaiya pore re * 

*Hai hai praner bondhu re …* 

[What is love amorous Kalachand does not know, love occupies my mind 

When will meet my   friend 

my mind is restless 

The rain in the month of *bhador* drips drops pours down 

Alas my dear friend …] 

Noorjahan inhaled the smell of the flowers and listened  to the cracking nasal voice of his father -in-law. That meant Abba had agreed. This loose skinned haggard did not know that by marrying Noor to Rasik, Bhattacharjee only wanted to secure her for himself , wanted to make her his kept. Even if he knew, the spineless old man did not have the capability to disapprove. He lived at Noor’s generosity, like a worm, and Noor lived at the generosity of Ramanath Bhattacharjee. 

Noor had never seen Rashik. Bhattacharjee said that he was an idiot, crazy about songs. Foam seeped out of his mouth. He worked like a bull. Even if he was abused as a son of a bitch he displayed all his teeth . One of his legs was smaller, he limped. He was physically weak. He knew no desire. That is why if she married Rashik they could live closer comfortably. 

Everything around was changing fast. Change was evident everywhere. When Fakruddin was murdered it was whispered that it was Bhattacharjee who had got Fakruddin murdered in order to enjoy Noor. But Ramanath Bhattacharjee never did anything like that. To him right or left all parties were equal. He donated generously to all. But why would people believe?  Spending nights with Noor beside river Gildani was becoming risky. He might be gheraored by some hoodlums some day. Youngsters looked out for such chances. Then his honour would be at stake. But Ramanath wanted Noor desperately. It was a kind of intoxication for Ramanath. After those who were for change won the Panchayat elections, Ramanath visited them and gave them a substantial donation. People in power had indirectly supported Ramanath in everyway so long. But Ramanath feared the young faces. It wouldn’t   be a problem getting Rasik to agree for the marriage with a few strong words of rebuke. It was difficult to get Noor’s consent. Ramanath had even persuaded Nuruddin. He said that he would allow Nuruddin to stay in a room beside Rasik that is now occupied by the laborers. Only, Noor did not agree. She was god-fearing. 

Noor picked up the *shefali* flowers and walked towards the river bank beside the farmland .There lay Fakruddin in his grave. She placed the flowers on his grave and walked slowly back. She entered her room and gave the sleeping Ramanath a light push. As the man opened his eyes Noor said – “I am ready to marry your dumb Rashik. I thought over and over last night. You were right.” 

Ramanath returned home early to find Rashik seated on the wicker stool in the beetle nut orchard and singing as usual. The noise of the car drowned the words. Puron garaged the car and walked off home. A syrupy sunlight began in the beetle nut orchard and  spread across the sprawling potato farm.  The delicate triumph of green assured that the harvest would be good this time. Nagen and Banga were working right in the middle of the farm. They seemed to be clearing the weeds. It looked like they were swimming in a green sea. But both of them are very shrewd, wicked. The first thing he had to do was to give them a notice to vacate their rooms. He walked  few paces and stood in the sun trying to listen to Rashik’s song. 

*Sadher bhomra uriya pore thai thai* 

*Kay kay se keuya phule madhu nai * 

*Phuler ala madhu nai bhomarao ashe na * 

*Moner jato gopon katha khuliya kabar chang* 

*Kaak kakim mor moner katha manushe naa pang* 

[The bumble bee flies and falls with a noise 

he says keya flowers do not bear honey 

there is no honey in the flowers, no bee comes 

I want to speak out my mind 

To whom should I speak out my mind I find no one ] 

Ramanath listened to the song and smiled inwardly. Rashik was singing, self- absorbed. He wore a sky coloured pyjama. He was wrapped in an old shawl that Aradhana had brought for him from Dhupguri once. On his head was a brown tattered balaclava. Fog came out of his mouth. He looked just like a monkey. Ramanath had never thought that this shapeless lame Rashik would be so useful to him one day. He smiled. 

Nanda served him tea. He carried the teacup to the sun and called up Aradhana. 

-Calling up so early? What is the matter? 

- There’s good news. 

-What is it? The rates of potatoes have gone up? The wholesale dealers have crowded to you? 

-*Dhuur*!  You have taken after your son. This is a different. 

-Awww. What is that? 

-I fixed up Rashik’s marriage yesterday. 

-Rashik’s marriage? What? Where? 

-In  Gilandi. 

-That’s really  a good news. Is she auspicious? What’s her name? 

-Noorjahan. 

-Noorjahan! 

-*Aare*  our old caretaker at Gilandi ,Nuruddin Alam. Don’t you remember? 

-Yes, yes, his son Fakru , he used to do farming  in our land. He had been murdered. 

-She is the widow of Fakru. 

-In the end you are marrying Rasik to a Muslim? 

-*Aare* I will convert Noorjahan into a Hindu. 

-What does Rasik say? Has he agreed? 

-*Dhuur*, he doesn’t yet know. 

That irritated Anuradha. 

-That is not right. One who is getting marred will not know? Won’t you consult him? Do not impose everything on him like this. 

--*Aare* Rasik is a stupid bull. All he needs is yoking and caning at the back. 

- Do not start with your abuses so early. Don’t know what witch you are getting for him. 

--No witch. Fairy. Fairy. Rasik’s fourteen generation hadn’t seen such a fairy. 

-Rashik will be getting married and I won’t be there ? Feeling very sad about it. Look even if you call him a bull Rashik is a good chap. Do not do anything that will hurt Rashik. *Bechara*. Even if he is in trouble he will never complain. 

Aradhana began with her lecturing early morning. Now Ramanath got irritated. The woman will never miss any chance of lecturing. Habits die hard. 

-Why are you so worried? The bull will get a good wife. 

-Gift some gold to Rashik’s bride. Present Rashik a finger-ring, a wristwatch. Make a bed for them. 

-Yes, yes. Will do everything. 

Disconnecting his cell phone he pocketed it to find  Rashik  standing right in front of him. As Ramanath looked at him he smiled with all his teeth out. Then he extended his hand and said “Hand me the teacup *karta.* I’ll keep it in the kitchen.”  He took the empty cup form Ramanath‘s hand and limped towards the kitchen. Ramanath turned his head to look at him. He looked like a primate slowly walking forward—a creature somewhere in between man and animal. Does a dumbo like him have anything called sexual urge? Ramanath asked himself. Then he took the ridge path of the potato farm and walked towards Nagen and Banga calculating the interests that he had to reap this year to make up for last year’s losses. The wholesalers of Dhupguri were already willing to buy at 500 per quintal. 

In the evening when the sun was dying but the far ends of potato farm still basked in a saffron glow , Ramanath stepped onto Rashik’s verandah for the first time. Inside Rashik was singing as usual— 

*Aji aulailen mor banda mayal re * 

*Hatir pithite thakiyare mahut * 

*Kisher batul maro * 

*Ore porer oi kaminike dekhiya * 

*Jaila keno maro ro …* 

[Today my pet python uttered 

Mahout, sitting on the elephant back 

Why do you whip the elephant 

Why do you burn with jealousy 

Seeing another’s love] 

Listening to few lines Ramanath had a feeling ; was the son of the bitch intending those lines at him? Ramanath coughed deliberately. He pushed the door open and entered into the room, for the first time . This was his room , why did he need permission? 

Rashik was completely taken aback. Ramanath was equally surprised. The room was smaller than a cow’s shed. Rashik had kept it spick and span. The bed was neatly arranged, the broken chair was clean and shinning. An old Murphy radio on the table. A glass of water  covered with a plate. A crude flute beside it. Smell of incense stick. Lot  of calendars carrying pictures of gods –Shiv- Parvati-Ganesh –Durga –Kartick - Kali . Jesus Christ was also there. Also a picture of Kabba of Mecca. Rashik dusted the chair with the gamcha that hung on his shoulders and said – “Sit *Kartababu*. How did come suddenly?” Ramanath sat on the chair and he took up the flute. Rashik said –“Mother has left me this. It was father’s flute. It is like god’s gift to me.” 

-Rashik don’t you want to marry? 

-Marry? 

-Yes. Everybody marries. Keeps a family. 

-No. I don’t wish to marry. 

-Why? Why don’t you wish to marry? 

-You know everything. I can’t work efficiently. I am rebuked. I do not earn much. Besides, I am lame. Physically weak. I have no brains. Everybody calls me cow. You know everything. 

- I will enhance your salary. How much are your expenses now? 

-You bear the expense of food. You have given me a room to stay, and pay me a thousand. 

-Okay, from now on your wife will cook for you. I shall pay you three thousand . 

Rashik thought something. Perhaps he quietly calculated. 

-That will do I think. But Girl? 

-        I have seen  a girl for you. She is a fairy Rashik, a fairy. But a widow. 

-        Widow . *Eshsh* .If  hubands die the wives suffer a lot. I saw my mother .No husband means no life. 

-        Her name is Noorjahan. She is a Muslim 

-        Muslim. 

-        Yes. But I will convert her into a Hindu. She will have a different name .She will also do Laxmipuja. 

-        No. No. Why that? My religion is mine. My wife’s religion will be hers. Why   change ? 

-        Then you  have agreed ? 

-        When you have approved her ... But one word. 

-        What? 

-        Does the girl love songs? 

-        Listen. Stop all these nonsense of yours. If she hears your songs she will run away the very first night. No body listens to these songs now-a-days. 

Rashik was hurt. Then he laughed forcefully and added “Okay, that will be done. That means she likes movie songs. Hindi movie no ? That will be done. 

Next day Banga and Nagen were evicted. In a day’s notice they rented rooms in  Puron’s locality . They could not understand what their faults were. Rashik’s room became a big room once the partition wall in the middle was removed. 

It was as if Rashik was watching a magic show. A new bed came in.  New mattress, pillows, quilt. One big mirror. One small colour TV. Till now he used to light oil lamp. New electric connection came in . A twisted milk white bulb gave out light. New table. Various cosmetics for women. New scarlet red stove. Plates-bowls-cauldrons-glasses-ladles-spatula. Utensils for kitchen. One day while spraying pesticides in the potato farm Nagen said “ I see that he has placed you in heaven. Even if he calls you son of a bitch the landlord loves you from the core of his soul.”  Rashik laughed with all his teeth out. But as he laughed a melancholy resounded inside him.  He had not been singing the few days. Songs came up to his throat fervently trying to flow out. But Rashik did not sing. He strangled all songs inside his throat. 

His own room seemed unfamiliar to Rashik. As if a dream.He touched the TV. He touched the bed. Nanda had come to instruct him how to operate the TV. Rashik did not remember how. He left the remote on the table. He gained happiness just out of touching it. He hid the old flute under the mattress to avoid Ramanath’s scolding. He touched the stove. He touched the steel utensils. Rashik had never ever cooked. God knows what his wife will cook for him. He lied on the new soft bed  at night and sang softly: 

Baranir dhaner khoi bhajlam 

Sonar bondhu mor ashilen koi? 

O mor bondhu dhon rashiya 

Guapaan khaiya jao bagole bashiya 

[I fried parched rice 

My dear friend did not come 

O my friends come sometime 

Sit beside me and have beetle nut and paan] 

Just two days after Mahalaya Ramanath said –“Bath properly and be ready tomorrow morning.  I will go to bring goddess Durga for you. Wear these and look robust.” 

Ramanath left a packet for him. Rashik opened and saw an embroidered Punjabi and one Pyjama . Ramanath had brought a sandal for Rashik before. 

Next morning Rashik washed himself and wore them. Ramanath took Puron and went to Gilandi in his car. There was another car. Hired. That was for Rashik.  Banga, Nagen and Nanda went along with him. Pata Chakraborty joined them on the highway. Pata was the Government representative here for arranging registry marriage. Rashik sat shyly in the corridor of   the Marriage Registration Office in Jalapiguri. Nagen and Banga  shared rotten adult jokes. Rashik’s ears burned hearing such rotten allusions to body. They waited for one long hour. Nagen then uttered the worst joke of the day – “Did *Karta* run away with your  bride? Such a long wait. They haven’t yet come.” 

Ramanath ’s car entered a little later. Rashik saw her white feet as she opened the door and stepped out of the car. Can  feet be so beautiful? So white? Banga whispered—“She has come from heaven Rashik. She is not a human. She is a fairy.” They signed ,got married. While exchanging garlands Rashik looked at her face—pretty, but there was a melancholy in her face. 

After the ceremony Ramanath took Rashik’s wife in his own car. It did not matter to Rashik, but even Pata Chakraborty got angry. “What is this? After marriage bride and groom should travel together in the same car .Why will the bride travel in the Landlord’s car?”  Rashik took out all his teeth out. He smiled. 

Ramanath woke up early next morning and told Nanda : “Go , call Rashik’s wife. I will instruct her to help you with the housework.” Nanda was very happy. She got a helper after a long time. She went and called Noor. Ramanath sent Nanda to the farm to serve  Nagen and Banga tea and biscuits. When she went out of sight behind the beetle nut orchard  he caught hold of Noor and gave her one long kiss. 

-See how I solved all problems. You got a husband, I got a fairy. 

- Yes *Karta*. You are very clever. 

- He did not do anything at night, did he? 

-No, no . He was very shy. He was hesitating to change into his lungi. He did  not open his shirt in front of me . 

-He is a stupid fool. He has no sense of love or desire . He eats, sleeps and works like a bull. 

-Yes *Karta*. He sleeps deep. Snores loudly. 

Ramanath kissed Noor again, felt her body in various places. He rubbed his moustache against her cheek and said –“He is crazy about songs. During the pujas he sings wherever he gets a chance. Will send the chap off along with Thakurpath Jatra Samaj. Nanda also wants leave. She wants to go home . I will send her to Madarihat in the evening.” 

-Alright *Karta*, everything’s alright. But when will you bring Abba? 

-Let the old man remain there. Will send him some cash to run his household. 

--He suffers because he is old. Bring Abba today .I feel sorry for him. 

--Alright then . He can stay in Banga’s room . 

-Can I go now? 

-Will you go? What will you do there? 

- I will make some tea. Serve the man some tea. 

--*Babba*. Feeling so much just in one night? Ramanath snorted. 

On Sasthi it’ s Kahgenhat. Saptami Daukmari. Asthami –Ambadiba. Nabami –Talipara. Rashik would sing on all the four days. Excited he shared his invitations with Ramanath. He did not have any anxiety whatsoever about his newly married bride who would remain back home, alone. 

-When you are there why do I need to worry? I told Noor to cook you your rice and curry. Nanda is also not there. You are suffering. 

--Will your wife let you go? 

-She has not objected. Only demanded that on Dashami she will go to Gayerkanta burning ghat to see the immersion of the goddess. I told her that it will be arranged. 

-How is your wife? 

-She is very good *Karta*. She understands sorrow. She is religious. 

-How did you understand that? 

-When I play my flute at night she cries. Tears flow ceaselessly then. As if she is so much in agony. 

-Are you playing your flute for her stupid ? 

- I did not. She wanted to listen to it. There was father’s flute under the mattress. She found out. She said I will listen to your flute. I played. 

--I had told you not to. You dumb. 

-I have made a mistake, *Karta*. 

-Does anyone play flute at home?  Play in the Jatra. You will earn applause. 

-Right *Karta*. I have no sense of indoor and outdoor. 

As the evening dawned the dark house of Bhattacharjee’s wore a look of a haunted house. There was a nip in the air. Ramanath climbed up the terrace once and found Thakurpath engulfed in darkness. Far away on the Highway Durga Puja was being celebrated. The lights of the pandal could be seen. It was Sasthi. All the lighting decorations  were not complete yet. Suddenly the drums began beating. Perhaps   the idol of the goddess arrived from Gayerkantha by truck.  The drums played for long. Fireflies were flying thick in thousands over the potato farm. Ramanath looked at Rashik’s room. The corridor was dark. The door shut. A dim light could be seen through the wicker fence. It looked mysterious, the room that touched the wall. Nuruddin had put up  in Banga’s room beside Rashik’s. The old man’s room was dark. It seemed he had slept off early. Rashik had gone to Khagenhat to sing. Ramanath had instructed Noor in the afternoon to serve an early dinner to the old man and to come to him. The very thought was exciting. Sasthi, Saptami, Astami ,Nabami , four days at a stretch. No risk, no fear of young hooligans. 

The clock struck nine. Noor had not come. Ramanath climbed up the terrace again. Just then the drums began beating again. The beats seemed louder now because it was nighttime and all the other sounds had died out. That  dim light in Rashik’s room. No bulb had been fixed yet in Nuruddin’s room. A lantern was  burning there.  The light flickered. The old man was coughing. One could hear him cough form this distance. It seemed he did not have his dinner. Maybe he had. He could not sleep because of his cough. How could poor men live for so long was a real mystery. 

Ramanath could wait no longer. He had not given any gold ring to Rashik as Aradhana had requested. But he spent a lot. Not for Rashik. Actually all his  investment was for Noor. That beautiful widow had shaken his very roots. How could he wait? 

At  ten O’clock  old Nuruddin stopped coughing and his lantern went off. Ramanath wrapped his shawl and came out on the field. He could not bear it any longer. He would go to Noor himself. As he stepped down form verandah his ears turned cold. He drew the shawl over his head.  Own house, own homestead, own land, own investment –but still he did not know why he felt like a thief. Once in his childhood in an autumn night like this wrapped in shawl a thief had come crossing the boundary. There was a granary where Rashiks stay now . At midnight Ramanath had woke up to go to the toilet. He wanted to piss on the corridor instead of walking as far as the toilet. As he came up to the corridor he saw a shadow creeping towards the granary in the dim moonlight. The thief creeped till the granary door. Opened the lock by some trick and entered the room . Ramanath had forgotten all about his pissing. With widened eyes he stood there and watched. As the shadow entered the barn Ramanath yelled : “Thief , thief, thief .”  Chowkidaar came running with his three battery  torch. Lakhan ran upto the beetle nut orchard. At Lakhan’s Maithili shouting the thief jumped over the boundary wall and ran off. He had filled only 2 kilos of paddy in the sack but could not take it. 

Today Ramanath was feeling like that thief. As he thought of his childhood he turned to look at the corridor. Was anyone there?  Was anyone watching? Was he mad? Aradhana was with his son at Bangalore. Nanda had gone to Madarihat. Nagen and Banga had been evicted. They now stay in Puron Chettri’s locality. Stupid Rashik has gone to Khagenhat to sing at the Jatra. What did it matter if that old infirm Nuruddin saw. Yet Ramanath climbed up the courtyard and pushed at his door. It was locked form within. That meant that the old man had fallen asleep. Now in the autumnal wind Ramanath could smell the fragrance of Noorjahan’s body. 

Now he pushed Rashik’s door, to check. That was also locked from inside. The light was on. Had the girl fallen asleep leaving the light on? He tapped lightly twice. No response. Now Ramanath was annoyed. He held the iron ring of the door and struck loudly. Noorjahan’s voice came – “Who ? Abba?” 

-Not Abba. Noor . Me.Me. 

Noorjahan again shouted “Is it Abba?” 

Was the girl hard of hearing? 

Ramanath could shout if he wanted to, because it was all his investment. But he restrained himself and said : “It’s me Noor , Ramanath, your *Karta*.” 

-Aww. *Karta*! Wait, wait. Let me open the door. 

With that intoxicating aroma of hers Noorjahan opened the door. 

With her open hair she looked like a goddess who had left her other eight arms  back in the room to stand in front of Ramanath. So youthful was she! 

As she stepped into the corridor Ramanath embraced her tightly and said 

“What are you? When were you supposed to come? Since two hours I have been restlessly moving out in the terrace and corridor. And you are showing your antiques here ? ” 

Noorjahan moved away, took the shawl off Ramanath’s head and said –“ *Karta* , I want to tell you something…” 

-What is it ? Why words now?  No words now. Come up fast. 

-You have done so much for me . 

-Yes I have. I will do more. I shall wrap your body in gold. 

-That is why I am so obliged. 

-Obliged?  So what? You can lie with me and  pay everything back. 

- I cannot repay this debt. 

-*Dhuur *. Don’t lecture. Come. All can be settled. Come. Lock your door. 

- I cannot go anymore *Karta*. 

- Cannot go? Why? Are you mad? Why did I get you married to the bull after all ? 

-No *Karta*. Do not force. You are a good human being. 

Ramanath’s hands lost their hold. He removed his hands from Noorjahan’s shoulder and waist and asked , 

- Have you fallen in love with that bull? 

-I do not know. Is it love? Look . He is so crazy about songs , but once I asked him 

not to go he did not. 

Ramanath’s voice came down. He whispered “Didn’t Rashik go to Khagenhath then ?” 

-He had been. But he came back in the evening. He is having rice. 

Just then the door pushed open. A broad  light fell on the  shadowy 

corridor and  Rashik limped out with all his talents. He burped indecently, wiped his hands in a *gamcha*, revealed all his teeth and said- “ Had been to Khagenhath Karta…but could not tame the mind. Noorjahan had asked me not to go but still I went. But this was the first time I felt that there was song but no tune. There was flute but there is no breath left in me to blow through it. Because of Sasthi Puja there were no vehicles today.  How far was Khagenhath? I began walking. I reached  now.” 

Ramanath was looking at Rashik intently. He seemed almost celestial. His monkey – face shone with a glow. The light that was flowing from behind him, was it a halo? It was Ramanath’s own house, his own homestead, his land , his investment,--but yet he felt like a worm. He spoke in a soft voice  – “I thought you were not there, just came to see your wife , if everything was alright. You walked all the way from Khagenhat ? Must be exhausted. Go, go to sleep, both of you.” 

Rashik took out all his teeth out and smiled. “Karta please do not be annoyed. We will not sleep tonight. I shall sing all night. Noorjahan’s request.” 

Ramanath drew the shawl upto his head and started walking towards his house. The pleasant structure of Bhattacharjee ’s stood in front. Today, in this gloom of Shasthi it looked like an abode of the dead. He walked towards it like a ghost. He realized that he was limping. He must be looking like a primate, something in-between man and animal. 

Rashik began singing for Noorjahan —“O my soul’s mate…”
