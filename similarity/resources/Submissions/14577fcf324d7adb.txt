*Squares **and **Circles* 

*by Suneetha Balakrishnan* 

*Shreya * 

She stretches out on the long chair, eyes half-closed; her pupils moving from side to side as she chases a dream between sleep and wake. 

A faint and tiny grey square pops up in the air, right before her eyes, close to her nose. It grows on all sides and then dissolves around her; another tiny square slides in. Shreya doesn’t blink. It goes on and on till she cannot count the numbers nor the minutes or the seconds any more. She starts feeling warm and then it grows hotter. She wishes she could break out of the labyrinth, but remains captive in the maze of closed lines. They hold her tight for a few seconds and then release her to float in the air; then take her back again, many times. 

A tiny drop of water floats towards her eyes and she waits to feel its blue, icy coolness. She knows it’s a flake of snow come down the skies, where the white fluffy clouds look close enough to touch. The snow flake melts in the warmth of those squares dissolving around her. The consoling chill hits her first as a sudden waft; she waits for the spray to envelop her. She wakes to the murmur of the air conditioner on full blast, and a soothing voice, 

- Feeling better now? 

Shreya blinks for a few moments and then nods at ‘Doctor Uncle’. His stylish pair of spectacles do not remind her so much of RK any longer. Slightly so, yes, but RK is so much younger than Uncle, and so far away. The good man himself waits with an inscrutable expression, his long frame adorning the entirety of the other chair in the room, usually meant for the ‘patient’. The patient is supposed to be in conversation with the doctor at this moment but all she can think is ‘it’s….three…four…no almost twelve weeks since she has chatted with HIM’…RK…and it’s simply painful…damn, f***ing painful not to see his familiar profile pic of Ben10 in the corner of the chat box. Yeah, chat box...she will not explain once again that she does NOT use whatsapp. What must he be thinking now of her absence? She had left abruptly…pulled out rudely from that world by the snap of a switch and then cut off her mobile as well. And her birthday? What had happened to THAT? But those pics that RK had showed her, she had her doubts about them now. 

- Shall we talk now? 

Shreya does not relish the sudden raze to ground-realties but Doctor-Uncle has already leaned forward in his chair and started on his ‘procedure’. Shreya knows very well what would ensue and wait for the next question. 

- So, what are we going to do now? 

Shreya takes a deep breath. She knows the effect this answer will have on not just Doctor Uncle, but on her parents too. She waits for the reaction. 

*Pramila* 

At the beauty clinic, there is an early customer. It’s the bride of the week come in for her pre-marriage pampering. Pramila knows she has to deal out even more than the ‘pampering’ and she consoles herself with some figures on the bill she will present the bride-to-be that evening. She begins her act and throws open the silk curtains of the VIP cubicle with a theatrical gesture and murmurs, 

- Come in, princess! 

The bride shakes off the gold-heeled shoes from her not-so-pretty feet, which her obviously less-important-cousin picks up and wraps into a cloth bag. Pramila smiles her first fifty-watt smile of the day. She reserves the hundred-watt smile for the moment of departure of the customer; in tune with the filling of her cash box and the emptying of her batteries; a bride is an exacting and exhausting customer. The hundred-watt smile will serve to convey that the make-over has been effective; the ugly duckling is now a swan ; well, for the week at least. 

Pramila’s manages to camouflage her pre-occupation under her thick make up but her fingers falter slightly when she threads the bride’s eyebrows into a cupid’s bow. The pucker on the bride’s forehead warns Pramila and she pours lip-balm into the haughty girl’s ears. 

- that was a *really* stubborn hair tip…not one you usually pluck out, *hai na*? But we *must *have a different shape to your eyebrows this time, *eh dahling*? 

She cannot afford to lose this bride’s favour, this one has a sister and two close cousins getting married before this marriage season would be over. And these four together should provide for the shrink’s fee, which is heavy, by any standards. But what can one do, he IS the best in town too. And trust her kid, well Vikram’s kid as far as character goes, to get into trouble at such an early age. Why couldn’t he have checked what she was doing on the computer all those hours? Do some parenting at least, if he cannot earn and provide for a family? Pramila sighs and switches on her second fifty-watt smile and holds the convex hand-mirror to the bride’s face. 

- *So* pretty, *hai na*? I think you *must *continue with this eyebrow shape even after the *shaadi…* 

The bride’s eyes are huge in the large image thrown back by the mirror and she frowns, 

-I don’t look like me at all. 

Pramila starts the reassurance talk, well-rehearsed through several marriage seasons and signals to her assistant to open the ornate door to the spa room. 

- Darling, Just look what waits for you? 

She beams at the bride and watches the frown melt away. The huge cream-coloured, shell-shaped bath tub looks like a bridal bed strewn with red rose petals. She waits while the bride makes the usual fuss and then yields to the stripping down and watches her unwieldy fat body disappear under the floating rose-petals. She signals to the assistant again and Beethoven’s symphony fills the room. The bride slides further down into the water and Pramila guesses by instinct that she is pleased about the ‘*English moosic*” that is put on for her.  Peace for half-hour now! 

Pramila moves out of the VIP cubicle and dials a number on her cell; in a few seconds her face signals relief as the call is picked up and she asks, 

- Doctor, Pramila Vikram here, what does Shreya say? 

*Vikram * 

Vikram takes the last sip from the glass and leans back on the pillow he had propped up on the bed stand.  He pumps his fist into the bed, gosh, it was soft. How *can* people sleep on such soft beds? Is it a feminine thing? Vikram tells himself again that Shreya is now a young lady, all of fourteen years old. And in any other circumstance, his lying on this bed would be considered … well, not quite right at all! Damn these contemporary definitions of parenthood! 

Whenever they had a guest staying overnight, shifting to his parents’ bed and sleeping sandwiched between their different smells, had been a norm, back in his childhood. Mama, smelling of what she last cooked, sometimes even onion and garlic and Dad’s sweat, manly and acceptable. But Shreya had always had a room of her own, and an ayah to sleep escort. Pramila’s excuse was 

-          She needs to be independent. 

And as usual she has her way. 

It has been so long since he even gave Shreya a hug or a kiss, Pramila’s modern parenting standards denies him all the favours of a daughter. He doesn’t know if Shreya thinks the same, they just write polite emails and send birthday greetings twice a year. The summer holidays see her being chaperoned strictly by Pramila’s mother, the shorter holidays takes the little one off to camps. His own breaks at the de-addiction centres don’t help either! 

These days he sees her mostly on Facebook, well, at least till three months ago, that is!  But the minute he logs in, she disappears off chat. Some days he manages a Hi; on others he draws a blank. So where is his daughter after all, right now? Resident at a shrink’s, for god’s sake! And all for a teenage issue which he could have solved well-enough! But no, Pramila wants it this way, and call it a personality course for all who cared to ask what was up with Shreya. 

Vikram remembers his own fascination with a plump, fair-skinned chit in his own hey-day and smiles. He had wanted to marry her then and even had told his Dad that he would be a taxi-driver to make a living. Vikram laughs out loud. His Dad had solved the issue so smoothly, even without him knowing it. A page of a yellow journal had done the job for his Dad. 

This was exactly what he had tried to tell Pramila too, that he could talk to her, instead of wasting all this money on a fancy shrink, even if he is Pramila’s third cousin! The kid could just be allowed to do what she was doing, for God’s Sake! She could chat with Brad Pitt or RK or anyone she liked, have a fantasy about the guy, she only needed to be aware what she was doing! Whoever said a bit of fun was bad? Damn Pramila and her prudish take on every single thing that existed! 

Vikram fumbles for his glass and takes another long sip from it. Is the cell on silent, he peers at the screen and satisfies himself that it isn’t. Then why the hell isn’t Pramila calling, the shrink had assured them that Shreya would give an answer by today and the day was almost over. He had better take a walk now, Vikram tells himself and raises himself from the bed, the bedcover is all askew now but it is alright, he tells himself, he IS the Dad after all, he had the rights! Or did he? 

*Dr. Rohit* 

Dr. Rohit pops an energy capsule into his mouth and tries to swallow it dry, then looks for his water-bottle under the table panel. He likes his table to be clean and without distractions; which, to him, means empty. 

-then why do you have that table there at all 

A question that comes up often, which he counters with 

-would you like to speak on a stage not standing behind a dais? 

The polished mahogany-tinted plywood table sets his status as a therapist, or ‘shrink’ as Pramila keeps referring him. Wilful girl back then, wilful woman now, and she WON’T acknowledge the cousin-link, but he had to grant it to her for grit. That futile alcoholic she still tolerates as husband only sponges off her hard-earned money; but she does make a packet, or so he hears from the family grapevine. And works hard for it round the clock! The only ‘Make-over Miracle’ shop that is open from seven to nine and even taking appointments beyond those hours. He wonders how she manages to get staff for that fancy outfit of hers with such bizarre hours. 

And the results show! Pramila may sell beauty but looks like hell under the paint, and her only kid is a depressed creature wandering between the real and virtual worlds. Pramila doesn’t have time to spare, and she won’t let Vikram into the problem. 

-What the hell, Vikram IS the problem most days! 

That’s the response when he suggests bringing Vikram into the therapy sessions. Not that he thought it would work fully; he would probably have another patient on his hands. Yeah father and daughter! One addicted to alcohol and the other to internet. And how does one explain a cyber-relationship addiction to a mom who has no idea how the web works and doesn’t care either? It doesn’t help that the relationship the kid has is a total fake. Pramila just screams 

-will you get her back to normal and MAKE her understand that she CANNOT have a bloody relationship with someone she hasn't seen at all, and any relationship at all at just twelve?  She should be working for her exams! 

After three months of counselling, and missing the exams the kid seems to have come round to accepting reality. That God RK, as the kid calls him may have clay feet! But how is he going to break the news to any of the parents of what else he has discovered about the kid? Damn! It would have been easier if this had been a usual patient and not the kid of a childhood companion. But the music would be played loud and clear in an hour and Pramila and Vikram would have to face it. Visiting porno sites is more serious when it’s a guided activity by an adult, which he has no doubt this RK is. And he will definitely need the help of Vikram to pull this guy into a trap.  That’s probably the best way to handle this. And he had a task on hand getting Pramila to agree. What’s Pramila anyway going to do on a chat platform, and when is she going to find time? An appointment six months ahead? Hah!  He looks out of the window and sees the climbing vine with the flowers at the top, he notices that the vine held several bunches of young buds too, something he had not noticed before. He smiles. A car stops outside and Dr. Rohit waits for the bell.
