*Pammi Will Wed Reghu* 

On her 21st birthday, Pammi pretended that she came from Australia. She went to Harry’s Pub in Lajpat Nagar and ordered a drink, unsure of its ingredients, and then sat at the barstool guessing at the taste of alcohol and the men at the bar. When the Long Island arrived, she took her first sip in the barman’s company. She did not mind it, this new taste, and this camaraderie over a new-found ritual. 

She started slow: slow sips and conversation with women in stilettos. She started to talk of Michaelangelo but the ladies soon returned to their phones. She moved on timidly to surveying men. On cue, one of the species approached her. It was the barman again. 

-         *The first round’s on me. Cheers!* 

-         *You can drink on the job?* 

-         *I’m off duty*. *So what are we celebrating? * 

Mr. Suave Barman quickly added up her story: new to New Delhi, just got a job at the Supreme Court, just broke up with her boyfriend. One two ka four. Four two ka one. 

-         *My name is Lakhan*. *What’s yours? * 

-         *Pammi... um... you can call me Pam. * 

-         *I like Pammi. I like Punjabi girls. And I love this song. Perfect break-up song.* 

She remembers him expertly holding their drinks as they sashayed to ‘*Let’s Break Up, o meri jaan’*. That was 7 years ago, exactly. 

Ashraf finally managed to get through to her. He wanted to meet for her birthday, *Remember,* *where we first met?* 

She was at Harry’s Pub at 9 pm sharp. Ashraf walked in unhurried, 40 minutes later, looking as dapper as ever. *Fuck him*, she thought. 

Ashraf leaned across to the barman immediately as he arrived. *Two Long Islands*, he said out loud, and then turned his smile full-beam on her. 

*Fuck him*, she thought again. 

-         *Happy birthday, Pammi!* *Sorry I got stuck in traffic*. 

-         *It’s Pam. And that’s funny because i just ran into Reghu a while back. He was coming from the same direction. Said roads were so clear, it took him 20 minutes. * 

-         *For God’s sake, Pammi. I’m telling you the truth.* 

-         *Oh, I’m sure, Mr. Lakhan.* 

-         *Oh common that was so long ago. I can’t even remember... * 

-         *7 years ago. It was 7 years ago, today.* 

-         *Yes. Yes, I remember. Long Island, 21st birthday, and that lady in a lovely little black dress, sitting all by herself at the bar.* 

-         *I can’t believe you lied to me about your name. * 

-         *It was just a joke that went too far.* 

-         *Two whole months. * 

-         *You know what I also remember? Australia. Broke up with my boyfriend. Supreme Court. * 

-         *I’m not a liar. It was just *one* lie so that I wouldn’t get kicked out of the bar.* 

-         *Three.* 

-         *What? * 

-         *Three lies. * 

-         *Pfft! And I’m the nitpicker? * 

Ashraf leaned back and gave her that Mr. India smile of his. 

-         *That you are.* 

*Fuck him, *Pammi chanted, *Fuck him, fuck him, fuck him. * 

Pammi took the robe from Ashraf and closed the bathroom door. 

-         *I’m getting married* 

She came out wearing the robe. 

-         *Excuse me?* 

Pammi shot down the urge to say ‘*Excused.*’ 

-         *You know the guy, vaguely. * 

-         *What are you on about? * 

-         *Reghu. I’m marrying Reghu.* 

-         *That’s fucked up. He just saw us yesterday at Harry’s, dancing to our song.* 

-         *Oh yeah? What song is our song? * 

-         *The break-up song. * 

-         *Which one? * 

-         *What the hell does it matter? * 

-         *You don’t remember. * 

-         *You saw me ask the DJ to play ‘Sayya ji se aaj maine break-up kar liya.’* 

-         *That’s not our song.* 

-         *Pammi, you’re frigging annoying.* 

-         *Our song was ‘Let’s Break Up.’* 

-         *What the fuck are you on? And what the fuck is the fucking difference?* 

-         *The fucking difference is that the first one was from a movie called *Dear Zindagi, *and the second one was from a film called *Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. 

-         *And what the fuck does it matter? * 

-         *What’s in a name? That which we call an Ashraf, by any other name – say Lakhan – would smell as rotten.* 

Pammi stopped brushing her hair. Ashraf was stone-faced, nodding his head, slowly, deliberately. 

-         *You’re getting married.* 

-         *Yes.* 

-         *To a guy called Reghu. * 

-         *Hm.* 

-         *Because my name is Ashraf.* 

Pammi put her brush down. 

*Chitra Kalyani is learning to write well. She is fortunate to have found two homes, in India and in Egypt. *
