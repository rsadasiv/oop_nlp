*Are hills like white elephants**?* 

*---Sunil Sharma* 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? 

The teaser fails to disengage Sandip from the  iPhone. 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? Priya insists, fingering her curly mane, lower lip pouting, eyes wandering across the room and outside. 

He is orbiting in another space; detached from the lunch-hour din in the MacDonald in Colaba, Mumbai. 

“Why do you not pay attention?” She asks irritated. Sitting near the exit, Priya watches the Friday rush hour traffic with the bored expression of a regular. 

“OK.”  He says. 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? 

“What kind of nonsense is this?” Sandip asks, his eyes unfocussed. “How can they ever be?” 

“That is my question too.” Priya chirps in.  “I asked my professor. He said they can be.” 

“But how?” Asks Sandip. 

“Well…professor says it is a short fiction by a famous American.” 

“Do they write fiction?” 

“Who?” 

“The Yankees? Thought they just made dollars…rest is shit!” 

“You are a nerd, Sandip!” 

“In love with a doll!” 

Priya smiles. “Nada!” 

“What the hell!” 

“What?” 

“This Nada stuff!” 

“Oh!” 

Sandip is not yet disengaged. “Why you drive me crazy with this stuff?” 

“Which stuff?” asks Priya, rolling her eyes. 

“This literary stuff! Heavy-duty!” 

“Because I am doing an MA in English Lit. That is why.” 

“But I am not into this…” 

“So what?! Ain’t you my BF?” 

“That does not give you any right to ply me with this boring stuff!” 

Priya flutters long and arched eyebrows. “Do not be a mean nerd?” 

“I am not nerd. Do you know about programming, Java?” 

“Nada!” 

“My gawd!” 

Sandip sips Coke, fiddling iPhone again. The doors swing open, carrying a bit of traffic sound inside the outlet fast filling up with teen crowd---torn jeans and Tees and Mohawk and undercut styles. American accent prevails. 

Priya says, “Why nasty?” “I am not. But do not hand me your Nada-Nada thing.” 

“Nada.” 

Sandip shrugs off. Lost in another realm. 

“Listen yaar,” says Priya. “I love literature. What is wrong?” 

“It is for morons…” 

“Nada!” 

“Hell with you!” 

“Seems you not interested in me?” 

“Why?” 

“Because you do not show any interest in my interests.” 

“Do you in mine?” 

Priya ignores the sullen accusation. Then she stands up. “I am leaving.” 

Sandip gets startled. “Why?” 

“Because you are…” 

“…a nerd. OK. I am. Tell me. I am serious now. Ask me. I am focused, real-time.” 

Undecided, Priya lingers. 

“Please! Honey!” 

“OK.” 

She settles down. They sip the Coke and crunch the chips. 

“Go ahead. Ask.” Sandip sounds eager. “That thing about hills.” 

“I asked can hills look like white elephants?” 

Sandip scratches his thick hair with a top knot. “No idea.” 

“Well, this is a home assignment. Write a piece on the story Hills like white elephants.” 

“Go ahead and write…” 

“But I cannot figure it out. Need your help…” 

“Show me.” 

“Look at the circled dialogue on the tab,” Priya says. “Or better, I will read it out. Here it goes: 

*‘All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasn’t that bright?’  ‘That was bright.’  ‘I wanted to try this new drink. That’s all we do, isn’t it – look at things and try new drinks?’  ‘I guess so.’ The girl looked across at the hills.  ‘They’re lovely hills,’ she said.  ‘They don’t really look like white elephants. I just meant the colouring of their skin through the trees.’  ‘Should we have another drink?’  ‘All right*.’ 

Tell me now.” 

Sandip scratches his hair---a habit to annoy her she knows---and grins, “What the hell!” 

“Is that all?” 

“Does it matter?” 

“Yeah…it does.” Priya says bitterly. “You are like her American companion.” 

“Oh, yeah! I am American! Middle-class India is American.” 

“You are a turn-off.” 

“Why?” 

“You are…like that American only in the story.” 

Sandip grins. “If the hills look like elephants or not, what does it matter? It is fiction.” 

She stands up. “It does not matter. To you and her companion. OK. It never did, will never do. I am leaving, walking out on you, in fact…” 

She takes away her bag and leaves. 

Sandip, hurt, looks around. Nobody is paying attention to this little drama. After a quick bite, he too leaves hurriedly, muttering sotto voce: *What the fuck! Just for a fictional character and an atrocious plot!*
