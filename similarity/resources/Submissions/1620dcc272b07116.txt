I am a Mumbai-based journalist working with Economic Times. I have earlier worked with The Times of India, Outlook Business and Forbes India. 

I am 37 years of age and as yet unpublished. 

Please find below my short story titled 'A Meeting of Maids' for your consideration. My contact information is at the very last. 

*A Meeting of Maids* 

For the record, there was no confusion between the two Mamtas. One was the maid, who did the dishes and cleaning of the house. The nanny, of course, took care of the Lalits’ two-year-old daughter. The Mamtas shared only the name, and maybe, mood allowing, a little cupful of the oolong tea that Mrs Lalit made for them in the morning. When he called from his office, Lalit, who worked as an architect, was careful to un-twin them: *I hope the *Chhoti* Mamta came today.* To which, his wife would hold the phone near the nanny’s cooing--*listen for yourself--*a satisfying backdrop which included the noise of playthings and their daughter Sweta’s half-assed plosives. *Poo, Paa*. 

As words went, Chhoti Mamta didn’t talk much either, holding dear to a silence, that wasn’t unsettling, but rather coy. She had a Facebook account, and a smartphone that she charged on their living room table. Given her 18 years, what else could you expect, was how Lalit had put it, when his wife had held the age thing, if not her Whatsapping, against her as if it were a serious defect or something. But Mrs Lalit saw how Chhoti Mamta played with Sweta, tied her pony-tails expertly, and took her potty out, read her books, and rhymes, all done with a fresh spin on baby-sitting, one not yet sullied by the ennui of an underpaid, been-there-done-that carer. Correction: not underpaid. Lalit reminded his wife he paid her Rs 3000 for three hours of work every day. 

She was appointed after the next-door neighbour talked up Chhoti Mamta’s collegiate degree. It helped that Chhoti Mamta was none other than the neighbour’s maid’s daughter. It was in the family. Chhoti Mamta was unmarried, and a budding Christian. This, to Lalit, more than the fact Chhoti Mamta was a girl in need of surveillance herself, was a winning combination which was enough to counter his wife. He never heard from his wife again, after. Her grumblings, she learned to keep to herself over time, which sometimes felt like the self-punishment she craved for sitting at home, despite being a commerce graduate. 

********** ********** ********** 

Mamta called in sick the Monday of the first month Mrs Lalit took up Pilates classes. When she turned up one hour late the next day, Mrs Lalit threw more dishes into the kitchen sink. Mamta sashed her *dupatta* around her waist and uncomplainingly set to minus her workload. She did a brisk tour of the two bedrooms with a broom, check-boxed the hall, kitchen and balcony, and scrubbed them tidy with a damp rag. In between, she drank her weak tea, the rim of the cup, lifted a few inches above her lips. 

She might be late tomorrow, she told Mrs Lalit, and was gone in a flash. Mamta’s two grown-up children had rejoined school after their summer break. Mrs Lalit imagined Mamta’s other life such as it was: buying new school textbooks and wrapping them in brown covers, substituting for a husband who worked as a night watchman, and slept till sundown. But when Mamta begged for leave to skip her *pochha *on Wednesday, and do just her *jhadoo*, Mrs Lalit could no longer take it. 

In response, Mamta brought a 10th standard math textbook the next morning, and asked Mrs Lalit if she could spend one hour after work, running some numbers. She was, she told Mrs Lalit, aiming to crack the 10th secondary exam in an open school programme, for which she had registered at a private institute. She had been winding up in haste these past few days so that she could be in time for tuitions at her shanty where a retired high-school teacher was giving her free lessons. Feeling sorry, Mrs Lalit offered to teach Mamta, or be available for her if doubts presented themselves. 

********** ********** ********** 

Mamta brought sharpened pencils, and erasers, and used a ruled notebook. On the floor-mat, she spread her tools and sat cross-legged between the dining table and the sofa, and in that position she remained until she got up, having graffiti-filled two or three pages of her exercise book, and left at noon. Occasionally, she would look up at Chhoti whose time overlapped with hers now. 

Chhoti had seen her chores suddenly drop after Sweta went to sleep the moment she arrived, waking only at the end of her shift, which gave her a downtime. After stuffing the diapers into a dustbin, Chhoti traded words with Mamta, who seemed attached to her stationery. Mamta chewed the pencil end, and ate bits of the eraser, poised on a breakthrough which never came. 

“Tough, huh,” Chhoti essayed. She was texting her boyfriend simultaneously, *Meet me this evening at 6 outside maam’s house.* 

“Do you know what it is I am doing?” asked Mamta, which made the nanny look up from the screen. 

“Giving your tenth exam. Maam told me not to disturb you,” Chhoti said. She grew quiet, and seeing no response from her boyfriend, assumed that he was busy bagging vegetables at the super-mart where he jobbed. 

Mamta believed she had drawn the Chhoti’s attention to her, with an aspect of a seriousness that was conveyed in her posture – knees bent, back arched straight – which sure was alien to the nanny. At times, Mamta was not so much racking her brains for answers to problems as praying that she gets them somehow from above. God knew she prayed at temples. 

As Mamta took in Chhoti, observing her Capri that slim-fitted her legs, and the blue v-necked tank top, she realised she was the one who was drawn to Chhoti. Chhoti’s hair was either streaked or burned, Mamta couldn’t tell. 

“I am improving my math,” announced Mamta, for a moment imagining herself in Chhoti’s slip-ons. Her own boxy Bata chappals had been run over by a road-paving machine. She figured if she passed this exam, she might get called for better jobs. Who knows, she could be manning the front desk at a dental clinic, taking calls on a telephone, in toe-covered shoes, drumming her painted nails just like Chhoti, who had her half-moons on her phone. 

“Oh, I knew a girl, who took it in her late thirties,” said Chhoti. Her phone pinged, illumined her face which breathed into a smile. Her boyfriend would be late. Would 7 evening be alright? They were going out to McDonald’s, for chicken fritters. *Yes, ok, fine.* 

“Did she get through?” 

“What was that?” 

“The girl, you said, who took the exam. She failed, right,” said Mamta, and it was a trick she had learnt to forestall bad luck. Jinx an outcome if you want it so badly to be in your favour. Except that Chhoti was again on her phone, alerted to an emoticon with a beating heart. Minutes before Mamta refocused on her notebook, Chhoti said that the girl had failed. It was a difficult one, said Chhoti, and like Mamta, this girl was into house work. 

********** ********** ********** 

Mamta began to worship her math more ferociously in the coming days if only to kill the thought of being stuck here. At the Sai Mandir, she held diyas, and at Mrs Lalit’s, she tackled complex multiplication tables. 

Mrs Lalit had a way of making her feel unselfconscious, like she wasn’t there at all. In fact, Mrs Lalit routinely left the two Mamtas alone in the house with the baby sleeping in a *jhula* hung from the ceiling, and disappeared to do either a facial or planks behind a closed bedroom. 

Whenever Mamta puzzled over a math problem, she was overcome with guilt for not roping in ma’am into her torment. Then again, she reckoned, why would ma’am solve her math, even though she agreed to, knowing that she was going to lose Mamta. Perversely, this became Mamta’s motivation, that she would one day leave Mrs Lalit, put ma’am out in the cold, to take up more urgent duty. 

She glanced at Chhoti Mamta, who somehow was allowed to occupy a dining chair, her smartphone plugged into the switchboard socket. For the longest time, Chhoti would flirt with her smartphone, and the boyfriend, who kept her thrilled with an onslaught of emoticons that formed to say Namaste or Happy Diwali, or whatever. Chhoti was seldom, if at all, exercised by much else, as if she was being paid to decode her boyfriend’s word-pictures. 

Once, while leaving, Mamta watched Chhoti slip into Mrs Lalit’s Honda City in the back, Sweta in her arms, heading for vaccination at a paediatrician’s clinic and it brought back memories. Her brush with a car. She was fifteen and had been to the Marine Drive on an evening. There, a couple in a Mercedes slowed by her side, and asked for directions to an Irani cafe. Would she mind getting in the car with them, and showing them the left-and-right, as they were lost? The upholstery, it had smelled of attar, Mamta remembered now. There was faint liquefaction on the lady’s wrist, also of an expensive label. 

********** ********** ********** 

Two weeks of this – praying for answers? -- and Mamta had reason to think she could have a go at the exam. Yet on realising it, she was no less prompt in acknowledging Chhoti’s participation in it. Going out of her way, Chhoti had downloaded math shortcuts from her phone which Mamta then copied out onto her notebook. Mamta learnt Chhoti had scored an average of 89% in her 10th standard, which was mind-blowing in itself, given how Chhoti was from poor means. Even more surprising to Mamta was that Chhoti was a Christian convert, and her perks, no less her station, were a function of that. But, Mamta concluded, this was no surprise at all. Christians, Mamta had heard, were hired out as baby-sitters, office attendants and janitors as they were considered more hygienic. *The smart thing would be to convert if one needed to go up in life!* 

“But my boyfriend, Avinash, he is a Hindu,” Chhoti volunteered, and made it sound like he was a thug. 

“Your mother, is she worried about your prospects?” 

“Our Church doesn’t allow inter-religious marriages,” Chhoti said, and oddly nodded at her phone. It didn’t add up. Just then Mamta saw Chhoti was wearing a hands-free, with one ear plugged in, the other engaged in listening to her. Chhoti was conducting a video call with someone, while having this conversation with her. 

Chhoti was never in one place or with one person at any given time, it occurred to Mamta. Chhoti proselytised herself well, and it wasn’t only about her faith. Her smartphone channelled her teen distress without employing words. There was a library of pictures that Chhoti soon showed Mamta as replacing everyday vocabulary. Bread, egg, fruit, bat, etc. Then, a tap of her finger changed the keyboard into the familiar Devanagiri script, and Mamta typed her or rather their, names on the screen. 

Mamta resolved to do two things: buy a smartphone regardless of how long it would take to make it bend to her fingers, which was literally how Chhoti was doing it, as if it were a flexible thing made of rubber. Then, score a first-class in the 10th exam. Agonising over her goals that night, she wasn’t certain if a less materialistic dream would have been wiser. A mixer-grinder for the kitchen? 

********** ********** ********** 

A day before the exam, Mamta had a cold, *common* she thought, and accidently poured boiling water on her hands. It was a skin wound. She bandaged it with turmeric, and considered the pain, and its peeling effect on her morale. If it was nerves, then she scarcely gave expression to it in the exam hall. She wondered how nerves would be depicted if it were a picture. For three hours, she achingly wrote with a biro, sweating through her blouse, and emerged from the exam hall, wiping tears off her cheeks. 

Resuming normal hours, Mamta looked forward to the old Mrs Lalit treatment. Dagger looks, kindness drained out of her ma’am’s voice, the sink overflowing with more grubby pans. Something in her bones now taunted Mrs Lalit to stick it to her. She missed her time with Chhoti whom she rarely passed by in the corridor on her way out. She didn’t want to call the girl either and find herself tongue-tied. What would she tell her? Thank you for the downloads and your smartphone widsom? That would be too patronising coming from an older person, she decided. 

A week on, as Mamta checked the Pass and Fail list put up on the display board at the institute, her name was on the right, debited from the winners’ tally. She didn’t cry then, later or ever when thinking about the effort gone waste. Her recovery was fast-paced, just as the burn on her hand scarred over. 

Then, on the third day after she returned to the Lalits’ following a study leave, a call came from Chhoti’s mother who had her number given to her by Chhoti.  Her daughter’s phone had gone missing last week, the mother said, while Chhoti was entering Mrs Lalit’s house. One minute it was in her jeans pocket, and the next it was gone. The mother demanded to know if Mamta, by any chance, had seen the phone or anyone with it. *No*, Mamta said, not mistaking the tone that was being used. If she was being accused of having stolen it, Mamta put the mother to rights. She let it be known that she was a keeper of at least two house keys, whose owners trusted her to let herself in while they were away, do her *jhadoo, pochha* and leave things as-is. Besides, Mamta had been on a break to prepare for her exam. Have the police come and check her belongings, she will prove she has nothing to hide. 

The mother hung up abruptly, almost as if she was frustrated with one more person on her list of suspects establishing her alibi. Mamta didn’t enjoy clearing her name as much as she would have liked to. She cursed the timing of her longing for, of all the things, a smartphone. Couldn’t the phone have disappeared before she came to know Chhoti? Circumstantially, Mamta was off the hook. But it didn’t cover her conscience which still arraigned her. The mother being a good Christian didn’t swear at her, and it would have assuaged her so much more if the mother had. Instead, the mother was calm. All around her, people exhibited good behaviour. Even Mrs Lalit didn’t mention a thing to her. It made her scared even more. Every minute that she worked silently, with her back to Mrs Lalit, she thought they were plotting to remove her. But whenever Mrs Lalit was on the phone with her husband, it was about child-rearing or something to do with ergonomic baby-carriers. 

Once Mrs Lalit did bring up the missing phone with her husband. Mamta was lucky to be near to overhear it. The phone couldn’t be traced as Chhoti hadn’t registered it. Chhoti had bought a second-hand phone from a dealer in Powai, who didn’t believe in bills or that sort of thing. She hadn’t installed any tracking app. It explained why Chhoti and her mother weren’t reporting it to the police. 

Taking things into her hands, Mamta accosted Chhoti in the corridor, after lying in wait for her behind a pillar. There was no pain of loss in the girl’s body language. Poor thing, she was trying her best to put it all behind her with a sunny face, was Mamta’s thought. Chhoti was wearing leotard leggings and matched it with a grey T-shirt.  If that wasn’t a way to dress up her grief, then what was! Mamta was pained to see Chhoti be brought to her knees. Without her smartphone, the world was pegging them even. They were one of a kind. 

“When and how did you lose it,” Mamta asked. 

“Don’t. It is a closed chapter. I guess everyone loses a phone at least once.” She was even smiling about it. 

“Listen, I didn’t pass the exam,” Mamta said, as if it would make Chhoti feel better. 

“There is always another time,” said Chhoti and with a swift motion she ejected a smartphone, bigger than the earlier one, from her jeans pocket. She punched in something, and pressed send. 

*Avi, call me on this new number. Got lucky. Maam gave me a phone they weren’t using. *
