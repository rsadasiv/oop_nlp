*Gopal Varma* and Satish Parmar grew up on the south of the city, near the Nirma soap factory. They attended the same school, walked side by side in brown shorts and white shirts. Whenever Satish had a fight, Gopal helped and finished it. They ate at one another’s houses and people said they must have been brothers in their last life. Satish started to smoke around twelve and made Gopal smoke too, but he never really cared for it. When Satish’s baba caught them, he covered for Satish and lied that the cigarettes were his. They liked the same girls in school and even though they argued, Gopal would let Satish win, and allow him to ask the girl out first. If the girl said yes, he would sulk about it for weeks afterwards before asking another girl out, not always with success. In the holidays, they played cricket on the dusty maidans and Gopal was the better player, something that Satish resented. They worked at Satish’s baba’s garage for pocket money. It annoyed Satish when his baba praised Gopal by saying he was a natural with cars, and why couldn’t Satish work hard like him. At such times, darkness would cross Satish’s face. Gopal saw it, decided to stop working at the garage, and took up a paper round instead, although he missed working with cars. In his spare time, he read how to fix engines and dreamed about opening his own garage someday. Satish’s mood brightened, though he never was much of a talker or liked to smile. They finished the twelfth standard with above average marks but couldn’t afford to attend college. Satish argued with his family about being poor and hated that he couldn’t afford college. Gopal tried to calm him by saying his family had done their best and that he shouldn’t be so mean or angry. Satish replied that a degree would have helped him to escape the hard life. Now he was condemned to work for a pittance just like the rest of his family, and he hated them for it and he would never forgive them. For a few years, they found manual work. Satish had decided not to work for his baba after they had one argument too many and he left home. Luck however smiled upon him, he was hired as a sales assistant at J.K Electricals. It was against his baba’s wishes, who had wanted Satish to help him expand the garage. His baba asked Gopal to work for him instead and this pleased Gopal no end; he was back doing what he liked best. Satish rented a one room flat overlooking the maidan and a year later, he was engaged to Leela. Whenever Gopal visited, Leela said that he had a poor choice of clothes, and didn’t even own a car. She would also add that Satish was doing so well for himself, he had a car, flat, and that they were going to get married. She spoke bluntly as was her habit and without caring that words hurt. Gopal shrugged his shoulders and Satish would remain quiet. It hurt him that Satish didn’t defend him in front of Leela. Therefore, he stopped visiting so much, and besides, working under cars didn’t leave him spare time either. It took time to wash and scrub off the grease from his body. He didn’t want to visit Satish looking untidy anymore and even when he was clean, he thought twice about visiting. It so happened that love bloomed in his hard life too, as it can when you least expect it. One day after fitting the exhaust on a bright red scooter, a young woman named Rita asked what he did in his spare time. He fumbled for a reply as he wiped his hands on a white cloth. She asked him boldly whether he’d like to see a movie. He said yes with a shy smile. They went out a few more times with their hearts on fire. They were engaged soon after. When they visited Satish’s flat, Satish said. ‘Rita’s nice Gopal. She seems content and you’re lucky.’ It was an odd statement. He had more time with Satish now, as Leela spent her time with Rita, and those were good days. They sat and drank together, made simple plans for the future and watched a young Tendulkar bat with elegance and timing. A year later Satish had made assistant store manager and Gopal married Rita. Satish threw a big party, was the best man, and drank the whole evening. Gopal had never seen Satish look so happy, but in the middle of the party Satish would leave to make calls. At such times, Satish would look around him sharply. By then Satish had become a father of a girl and maybe family responsibilities were weighing him down. Shortly after Satish bought a two bedroom flat and Gopal wondered how much Satish earned. But he was happy for him, happy for his success. They met most Sundays and Leela never failed to spread a generous amount of food. Gopal saw the new furniture, t.v, fridge and ornaments that appeared in the flat almost every month. Rita would say let’s not visit so often, she didn’t like Leela showing off. Leela never failed to put them down. They stayed away for a few weeks, then the next time they visited Gopal asked Satish how he could afford it. ‘I work hard. I’m the best salesman that bloody store ever had and I get bonuses. Do you think I steal it?’ Leela added, ‘You should work hard like Satish, then you too can buy a nice flat and car. You have no ambition Gopal, that’s your problem. Look how you keep poor Rita in your miserable flat. I mean she doesn’t even have a t.v.’ ‘I’m perfectly happy with my one room flat,’ said Rita. ‘And Gopal works hard too, working in a garage is no joke.’ That shut up Leela for a moment. ‘You’re too easy on him Rita* baby*, you’ll regret it later trust me. You have to push your men otherwise they will just sit around with a beer in their hands and scratch their fat backsides.’ They all laughed apart from Satish, who sat staring out of the window stroking his moustache and beard he had grown recently. It was after Diwali, when it happened. 

Firecrackers flew and exploded out of the maidan and smoke filled the air. The wives were in the bedroom looking at new saris they had bought, when Satish opened a drawer. He pulled out a black bag, unwrapped the cloth and showed Gopal a black pistol. Gopal put the beer down and narrowed his eyes. ‘This is my Diwali present,’ said Satish. ‘Don’t look so worried yaar, it’s licensed.’ ‘Why did you buy that?’ ‘For shooting practice. A gun makes you feel manlier Gopal. It gives you strength. It’s like, don’t push me around or else.’ ‘You don’t need a gun to make you feel manly.’ ‘You wouldn’t understand, you’re always stuck under a bloody car.’ Satish pushed the gun inside his belt, put his shirt over it and stood staring out of the window again. Gopal had seen that distant stare too often lately and noticed Satish no longer cared for normal conversations. ‘Satish, everything okay? You know, like you feel alright.’ Satish turned around. ‘You want to go for a drive. I have some work, it will be fun.’ ‘Works no fun, and not on a Sunday evening.’ ‘This will make you feel alive. You want to feel alive don’t you?’ ‘Okay, let’s go.’ They went out in Satish’s new black Fiat with the tainted windows, and drove far from the neighbourhood, going further east of the city. The air was cool as Gopal leaned an elbow out of the window. ‘Where are we going? ‘You haven’t been to this bar. People respect me there. You know, men have to get out now and then or you’ll get worn down,’ said Satish smoking. ‘And besides women don’t like men hanging around the house, it makes them mad. They’ll find excuses to have arguments.’ Gopal smiled, understood as responsibilities increased, men had to get out and catch some oxygen. He didn’t like to admit it then but he felt alive, driving out in the night. Satish parked the car in front of a dimly lit bar. They entered and several men raised their hands at Satish and grinned. They approached the bar, smoke smell, liquor and cheap aftershave surrounded them along with the stench of failed lives and broken dreams. The tall heavy man behind the bar said. ‘Thought you might lose your nerve Satu.’ ‘Not me Rockybhai. This is Gopal by the way, he’s like a brother, and we go back years.’ Rockybhai appraised Gopal, the man was in his mid-forties, grey specks shone in his short black crew cut hair. He had a pock marked face and a cigarette hung loosely from the side of his mouth. He wore a fancy red silk shirt that hung over his black trousers. ‘Good for tonight?’ ‘As always.’ ‘That’s my tiger. I tell everyone, Satu is my tiger. Now just talk to Devilal, you remember what I said.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Your *beerather* won’t cause any problems?’ said Rockbhai staring at Gopal. ‘No chance.’ ‘Okay this time I believe you Satu, don’t let me down.’ 

Gopal wanted to ask but kept quiet with a bad feeling turning in his gut. Rockybhai grinned to show an upper tooth missing. ‘I have a diwali present for you boys. Check out the back room. It will put you in the right mood.’ They walked to the back room, two plump women sat on a sofa in a blouse and petticoat with their cleavage on show and they wore red and pink lipsticks, and half a bottle of whisky was on the table with glasses. They sat down next to them and the women were quick to snake their arms around them and whisper sweet little nothings with sad smiles and eyes that were distant, and they had the faces of women who had long forgotten morals, and when they laughed, there were no nice tones, only vulgarity screeched out of their ugly mouths. Gopal’s head started to spin and he took a stiff drink but that didn’t help too much either. Within a few minutes, Satish disappeared into another room with pink lipsticks and closed the door. Gopal drank whilst red lipsticks ran her hand down his thigh. ‘No need to be shy,’ she said. ‘It’s okay, I only want to drink.’ ‘You are gay.’ ‘No, I’m married.’ ‘So what, baby.’ ‘Yeah so what, why don’t you beat it.’ ‘Your loss.’ She pulled a face and swung her heavy hips into the other side room. Satish came out after a while and sweat had formed over his brow. He came to the table, finished his glass neat and had the dark scowl of a man who had lost his grip on reality. ‘You didn’t like her.’ ‘No. And I don’t like this place.’ ‘I’ll find you a better one next time. Let’s go.’ Gopal didn’t say anything and felt bad about the night and he didn’t feel so alive anymore either. They stepped outside. ‘You drive Gopal.’ ‘Are we going home?’ ‘The night has only just started. I need to stop at a store first.’ ‘What are you involved with Satish, maybe I can help you.’ ‘You’re becoming worse than Leela, sala. Relax will you, you are going to have the most fun you ever had.’ ‘I don’t like it, I don’t like that Rockybhai, and he looks a bastard. What does he have on you anyway?’ ‘Nothing. Look, its ten minutes work and you can make five thousand rupees, more sometimes. I want you to join me, what do you make anyway?’ Gopal didn’t answer. ‘Forget it. This is nothing, I just wanted you to have some fun, that’s all. Anyway I’ll show you what real power looks like, and stop bloody sulking.’ He drove south now as instructed by Satish through winding side roads and after about thirty minutes, they were on long lonely road with dark fields to either side. Satish pointed to a petrol pump in the middle of nowhere and they stepped out as crickets chirped around them. ‘Gopal, watch how to make easy money, all you need is guts. I’ve become good over the last year and I’m respected now.’ Satish grinned and walked into the bright-lit store. Gopal followed behind and stood near the entrance looking at chocolates and spicy snacks. Satish went to the counter, stood in front of a middle-aged man who was about the same height. ‘You’re behind by twenty thousand, Devilal,’ said Satish. ‘I don’t have it. Business has been bad.’ ‘What do I say to Rockybhai?’ ‘Tell that *bhenchod*, I’m not paying you cockroaches anymore!’ The voice was loud, it seemed to echo in the store with real anger. Devilal clasped the baseball bat under the counter and without warning swung it towards Satish’s head. Satish on quick reflex pushed out his left arm, blocked the blow, and staggered back. Devilal ran around the counter and hit him fiercely on the body and legs like a man possessed and he was cursing Satish with mother and sister names. They fell behind a stack of shelves as Gopal hurried around to help. A shot went off. It was loud. Devilal screamed and staggered back against the counter and sat down. His thigh was bloodshot, his eyes were wide with fright, anger, and he cursed Satish to go to hell. Satish moved up, took the baseball bat and knocked out Devilal with one blow. Blood covered the floor as Satish pointed the gun at the body. Gopal grabbed his shoulder and said, ‘Don’t kill him Satish, don’t do it.’ ‘I should kill this bastard.’ Satish glared around with bloodshot eyes, grabbed the gold chain and rings from Devilal, limped behind the counter and emptied the till into a carrier bag and filled it with cash and change. Some rupees floated away as if witness to the scene. ‘He’ll pay the next time.’ They hurried out of the store. Gopal drove now and Satish was breathing hard for about ten minutes before he calmed down. ‘I’m sorry about that Gopal. That never happened before, you okay?’ Gopal remained silent. ‘I can trust you to keep your mouth shut right? I mean that’s the last time, I’m not working for Rocky anymore, I promise. We good, Gopal?’ ‘What’s come over you Satish?’ ‘A man has to make money or he’s nothing. ‘Not like this.’ ‘You feel alive don’t you. God that was the best. I didn’t think Devilal had it in him.’ ‘You might have killed him Satish.’ ‘It doesn’t matter. Kill one and you’re a murderer, kill a thousand and you’re a king. Now you just keep your mouth shut and everything will be fine.’ Gopal stared out of the window. They reached the flat and he didn’t go up but waited for Rita to come down. She came down in a hurry, they drove back to their one bedroom flat, and she asked him all the way, what had happened. He said they had been involved in a fight and that they had won and that was all. He hated lying to his wife and he hated himself. They reached home and Rita went to bed with a sulk, whilst he paced around the front room. He drank a couple of shots of whisky and sat staring at the phone in the dark. He picked up the receiver and put it down three times. The police emergency number danced crazily on his fingertips.
