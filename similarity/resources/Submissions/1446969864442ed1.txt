UNSEASONAL RAIN by ANUPA MEHTA 

Mark and Mira have been lovers for ten years. They met when Mira was 35, and he, a year younger. It was an unplanned meeting, so unplanned that it could only be a passing angel's blessing, showered upon their unsuspecting heads: an exquisite instance of serendipity. Years later, on what she terms a Joan Baez infused morning, Mira, now nearly 45, sits and recreates in her mind the details of virtually every occasion on which she has met Mark over the past decade. 

Surprisingly enough, for a relationship of so many years, the number of times they have met is few, and she is able to easily recall almost every tryst down to its barest detail: the café or the hotel room they met in, its décor, the texture and color of the clothes they wore, the food they ate, the way harsh and dim overhead lights heightened or softened the contours of their faces, the words they murmured, and the things that remained unsaid, or the way they made unhurried, gentle love and the feel of Mark's fingers stroking her hair ever so softly. Until suddenly, he would feel compelled to twist it hard around his fingers, and pull her towards him, so that he could suck her lips long and hard. 

Afterwards, Mark would tease her saying, "You make love 'eyes wide open'... your mind is like a video tape, forever registering every movement, every breath we take, so that you can conjure it back up across the screen in your mind to a T." And Mira would stretch languidly and say: "It's the only way I can even pretend to possess you." 

Her most beautiful, yet intensely painful recall was of an evening towards the end of their relationship, when Mark took her for a drive in his new champagne colored Honda civic. Earlier in the day she'd told him that she'd wanted out of their long-standing relationship for inexplicable reasons. Mark knew that it was due to the fact that he was unable to acknowledge her the way she wanted him to. But they were so polite with each other, even when conveying harsh things, that when Mark, who was running a mild temperature that day, had asked if she would still like to go for a last short spin with him, she was unable to desist. 

It was a Thursday. The sky was slightly overcast, oddly enough for November. Her birthday was just a few days away. Mira had worn black jeans and a short white cotton shirt with heavy silver jewelry and lots of eye make-up. She'd decided that their last meeting should be special. Mark loved the way she accentuated her eye--lids with thick brown kohl which brought out the honey flecks in her dark eyes, and so she took extra care with her eye make-up. "Angel eyes," he would mumble, his tongue in her ear, running his fingers across her eye-lids, after they had stared far too long at each other, their bodies almost clinging like shrink wrap, in non-descript cafes situated in obscure lanes where no one that Mark knew was likely to be there. 

That evening, he picked her up around 7pm from her home in Juhu in North Mumbai and drove over a never-ending series of flyovers towards Bandra bandstand. From where they were parked, she could see the lyrical silhouette of the upcoming new sea-link, a symphony of lines and curves that seemed to be forever in the making. 

Staring at the long line of cars and motorcycles draped with canoodling couples awaiting the canopy of dark to roll down, she'd remarked, "This is where lovers who have nowhere to go end up. Why are we here?" At which, he'd replied: "Aren't we just that, although now, now that you've decided to go, we may not officially fall into that category either. You tell me that I am not expressive, but now that we are here, you wonder why ...? So saying, he'd reached across to the back seat and brought up a black, fabric bag, which had a satin sheen to it and bore the blazing yellow logo of the multinational company he worked for. 

Unzipping it, he'd removed two wine glasses and a bottle of Australian Shiraz. Pouring out a full glass for her, he'd said, "... a toast to love, for having endured ... in the hope that you will change your mind. If only so that I can serenade you on the passing of yet another year of your life." He had then pulled out a pale blue box bearing the elegant silver font of Tiffany's from the bag. 

Trying not to stare at the box, Mira's heart skipped a beat: a part of her was elated. For a moment she thought that the Tiffany's box, despite its odd size, contained a piece of jewelry, a bracelet or, maybe, just maybe, a ring; that finally Mark was going to acknowledge her. Instead, Mark took out a silver and gold pen embossed with his company's logo, and held it out to her. Too polite to say anything, Mira took the pen and smiled, so as to not let him read the disappointment in her eyes. 

But Mark, who had the ability to grasp even her most imperceptible emotions, looked at her and said, "I disappointed you, yet again. But I thought the pen would be more symbolic than a silly old diamond. Yes, of course, I know it's embossed with my company's logo. But you know me ... I'm not into gestures ... I haven't done something like this ever in my life. Not even for my ex-wife or my wife. It's ironical that your imminent departure should inspire me to arrive ahead of myself today." 

Turning away from him, Mira quaffed her wine at one go and said that she was hungry, and perhaps they ought to go back. Mark placed his glass on the dashboard and, staring straight ahead through the windscreen, said: "Would you like to come home for a while? Sonia and the kids are away for the weekend. You've never come home all these years, although I haven't invited you, and you, I have to say, haven't asked either." 

Taken aback, but knowing that he was trying to make amends, Mira had stroked his muscled thigh and whispered, "Yes. Yes, that would be a nice thing to do." They'd driven to his home located in a charming little Catholic neighborhood. En-route, Mark had stopped at a subway outlet and packed two six inch sandwiches for them. Watching the man squish honey mustard on freshly baked bread - he'd thought to himself that he really didn't want Mira to go. He knew that he couldn't really expect her to stay forever, that eventually she would go, given he was unable to even grant her the little extra time that she craved from him. 

Sonia, his wife, often called him self-centered, a fact that he accepted. Mira though, was far too gentle to say anything so sharp to him. As he watched the sandwiches being packed, Mark made a quick mental note of all the things he liked about Mira, besides her still slim, taut body, with its firm white breasts and strong calves that hung ever so gracefully over his shoulders, each time he eased himself right into her. He thought then that her wicked sense of humor, her quick repartee, her joyous laughter and her quiet way of addressing even the harshest issue between them with as much grace as she could summon were among the many reasons why he continued to love her so inexplicably. 

Getting back into the car, he handed her the plastic bag with the sandwiches and quickly kissed the side of her scented neck with his lips, as Mira continued to look out of her closed window at the transiting lights of passing cars as they got reflected in the glass panes of parked cars. 

At his six storied building, charmingly christened Lourdes, Mira ignored the watchman and lift man's watchful eyes, as she waited for Mark in the lobby of the building while he parked the car. Neither Mark nor Mira said anything as the lift took them up to the fourth floor. The nameplate outside the polished wooden door bore his wife's name. Standing behind him, waiting for him to unlock the door, Mira could hear piano notes wafting down from the floor above. Somebody was playing *Hallelujah...* It struck her that it was all so genteel and different from the middle class colony she lived in with her mother. Mark led her in through the door into an airy, mid-sized living room, saying the flat had three bedrooms. 

Mira asked if she could wander around. He nodded, aware of her desire to soak in everything into the sponge of her mind, so that she could remember this moment too, just like the way she did the other occasions that he was prone to forget. Walking around, Mira made a note of the fact that Mark and his wife had an open kitchen. And that their living room was dominated by a large and uncomfortable looking deep red leather sofa, probably Italian in design - it faced a large flat screen TV and Bose speakers. She thought to herself that it was a very cold house, bereft of a personal touch. There were separate bathrooms for Mark and his wife, and one in the children's room. Hers was in their bedroom, while his was in the passage. 

In their bedroom, she noticed that their bed faced a mirror. Mira quickly turned away lest her reflection be caught looking at Mark's taut butt, as it rose above his wife's body - the fantasy was both unexpected and searing. Till date Mira had never experienced a twinge of jealousy, but suddenly seeing the reality of Mark's life, she felt her gut being squeezed as if held in a cold and steely vice. Distracting herself she noted that his wife's bathroom had smelt faintly of pee, very strong women's BO and period blood. There was a large white Turkish cotton bathrobe hanging behind the door. It was slightly dirty on the neck, as if its wearer perspired too much and didn't wash her nape too well. 

Amused at her minute inspection of his surroundings, Mark laughed, and said that his wife and he had decided that they should have separate bathrooms so as to not inhale all their odors! Walking into his bathroom, which was located behind a screen in the passage, Mira noticed that he had put up the two nude photographs she had gifted him many years ago. A wooden shelf in the passage contained odd bits, souvenirs from Mark's many trips and, hidden behind an ugly orange vase, she found the little bronze sculpted torso that she had given him on one of his birthdays. It struck her that it was almost as if her presence lived with him in the house that he shared with his wife. 

Hungry now, Mark led Mira to the dining table where they sat, and stared at each other for a while, till Mira reminded him that they were seated across his wife's dining table. Grimacing at her unnecessarily pithy observation, Mark poured out some over salted chips from a packet to eat along with their slightly soggy sandwiches, and poured out some more wine from a bottle with an Andalusian label, that he said his mother-in-law had brought him. Leaning over as they ate, he licked a trickle of mayonnaise as it ran down the side of Mira's palm. Feeling his warm tongue stir up a familiar feeling of want in her, she drew in her breath, and shook her head, her eyes beseeching him to desist. But he continued to run his tongue down her arm, moving up to bite gently on the tender skin on the inside of her wrist. 

After a while Mark rose, pulled her up wordlessly, and led her into the study, the room she had not been in, and pushed her pliant body onto a pale cream pile carpet. As his warm face rose above hers, Mira looked away, her recalcitrant mind wondering why he had given her the tour of his house on a day when she was about to leave him for good. 

Was it because Mark liked to remind her that he had a perfect little home and a perfect family life? Or was it his way of communicating to her that she was an integral part of his life, someone he valued enough to bring into the sanctity of the home that he shared with his second wife and children? 

Unable to respond, and unwilling to slip back into the magical little pool that they had been swimming around in circles for so many years, Mira pulled away from his feverish body. Surprised, Mark moved away and fell on his back staring at the ceiling in the dark. "Make us some coffee?" Mira whispered, pressing her face against his bare chest so as to relieve the moment of its tension. 

Nodding, Mark, polite as always, arose, picked up his clothes and went out towards the kitchen to brew some fresh coffee while Mira dressed. Placing the coffee cups in front of her, Mark, aware of Mira's eyes following him as he walked across to the music system, slipped in a disc containing Mira's favorite songs, that he had once recorded for her at 8am in a hotel room, as he had dressed to go to work, and she, on a buying spree for clients whose homes she styled for a living. 

He then walked to a large book case that faced the kitchen and pulled out a slim book of verse by Maya Angelou. Turning the pages, he read out a poem silently to himself and then pushed the book towards Mira. She read it too, quietly at first, and then aloud, in her soft voice. It was a poem about the hour of departure. Moved by the intensity of Mark's emotions that evening she'd asked him to write down the poem for her. Irritated by her request, Mark just ripped out the page and held it out to her. 

She took it, rose, and said that she would see herself out. But Mark insisted on dropping her home. It had begun to drizzle and the windows of the car had begun to fog due to the air-conditioning. "Unseasonal rain," he had mumbled. In response, Mira had said, "My grandmother used to say that the skies weep when the earth hurts too much for someone or something." "Bunkum," he'd retorted sharply. 

In the many years that they had been together, they had almost never raised their voices at each other. The one time that Mark had yelled at her was when she had chosen to date a very bright man whom they both knew, an architect prone to rash driving when drunk. Mark had acknowledged later, much later that his raised voice could have to do with the fact that he was madly jealous and disapproving of her little liaison, despite his own 

decision to continue to stay married. 

And now, she thought, this sharp retort to her harmless rambling. They had driven in silence for the rest of the journey. Alighting from the car outside the gate of her building, Mira did not kiss Mark goodbye. They were like that sometimes: careful not to press too hard into the fragile ground on which they stood. Mark drove around the city for an hour after Mira walked away from his life. He drove up and down fly-overs, all along willing himself not to break down; willing her to change her mind. But sometimes there is no looking back. 

Married now to a wealthy banking professional, many years older than her and who satisfies every desire that she could possibly have, (almost as if to make up for the number of days he is away each month), Mira often finds herself suddenly thinking about that last evening with Mark. Replaying it one more time in her mind this evening, she thinks that it's odd that she was neither devastated nor bothered by the fact that she finally visited her lover's home in his wife's absence. 

Even now, she feels neither guilty nor sad. She just doesn't feel anything, other than the fact that in her mind, Mark and she still exist and engage the way they did the first time they met and experienced a moment of recognition. It was just the way it was. And 

although, now all she has are her cascading memories, she is content in the knowing that only she is privy to those moments, and no one, not even Mark, certainly not her extremely kind husband, can take those away from her. 

Feeling the urge to re-read the poem that Mark had given her that night, she rose and went towards her linen cupboard. There, tucked away behind piles of pristine white bed sheets, sat a midsized blue wicker box. Rummaging through the box which was lined with white tissue paper, Mira searched for the poem. 

Looking at the contents of the box, she shook her head. Once upon a time she used to even save the burnt matchsticks from his matchbox. Alongside the withering bundle of burnt matchsticks, she found some pictures of him in a white bathrobe, a crumpled pack of Davidoff Lights filled with stale cigarettes, an empty pack of Norlevo, some key cards of hotels they had stayed in, a half-empty perfume bottle that he had gifted her along with his cap that she had snatched from atop his head. Beneath it, she found the wrinkled sheet of paper imprinted with the poem. It was titled *Prelude to a Parting*. 

Sitting crossed legged on a grey velvet covered stool facing her dressing room mirror, dressed only in a pink night shirt and grey panties, Mira read the poem out to herself in the moist cadence that arose from her throat each time she thought of, or spoke to Mark. She read, as if reading to him: 

*Beside you, prone my naked skin finds fault in touching. Yet it is you who draws away. The tacit fact is... the awful fear of losing is not enough to cause a fleeing love to stay. * 

Pressing the frail rippled paper to her lips, Mira shuts her eyes and finally recognizes that the poem, in fact, was Mark's Talisman for her. Sitting in the dark Mira recalls what Clarissa Pinkola Estes has written: "Talismans are reminders of what is felt but seen, what is so, but not immediately obvious." 

Tracing the soft line of her pillow with her toe - the nail is painted cerise pink, a color that her husband enjoys seeing on her - she wishes then that she had stayed on the way he wanted her to. Mark always spoke to her without words. 

Only, overcome by her own frailty, she had stopped listening towards the end. 

There is, after all, no going away from that which holds you. There is also the fact that there can be no past tense when one tries to speak eloquently of love.
