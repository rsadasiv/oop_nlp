 Tanmay was helping his grandmother in the garden. They pulled out the weeds and sowed brinjal seeds. After their work, Tanmay was tired. He sat on a big stone in a corner of the garden.'When I grow bigger I'll help my grandmother to be comfortable',thought Tanmay.

A dwarf passed that way. He had a magic box. It looked like an ordinary box. He said,"Hello, my boy." Terry stood up as if from a dream.

"Here is a box. It is a magic box. Do you see this red shiny button on the lid?"

"Yes," said Tanmay.

"Once a month press this button. A gold coin will fall out. You'll soon be rich. Don't try to press the button many times. It won't work. The box will fall apart" said the dwarf, smiling as he gave Tanmay the box.

"Thank you" said Tanmay with bright eyes and took the box. When he looked up, the dwarf was gone.

Tanmay took the box home. He felt good. He had something nice to show his grandmother. When he reached home he told his grandmother all about the little dwarf and the box. Then, with great excitement he pressed the shiny button. Out fell a gold coin! It was a joyous day.

Grandmother told Tanmay,"We'll have enough money for clothes and food. You can go to school. We can have a bigger house."

Every month Tanmay got a gold coin and soon became rich. His grandmother put by some money after spending on the house. A few years went by.

Everyone around heard of Tanmay's secret box. Some people were jealous. "Why don't you press the button every week?" they asked.

One man said, "If you press the button every day you will have a lot of gold coins."

Another man said, " Try pressing the button many times."

"Oh no, my boy. Never think of it. Follow the advice given to you and be patient. The box will crack. That will be the end of it." said grandmother pattingTanmay.

Tanmay felt restless. He wanted to see what was inside the box. He was losing control of himself.

One day, grandmother went out to see his sister. Tanmay thought, "This is the time. Nothing will happen if I press the button many times and grandmother won't know anything." He held the box in his hand and looked at it. He pressed the shiny button many times. The box cracked and fell to pieces. Tanmay was frightened. There was nothing inside. That was the end of gold coins.

When grandmother returned she saw what had happened. She did not scold the little boy. She had saved enough for his education Tanmay was hiding behind the curtain. Calling Tanmay she said," Always obey good advice. Patients pays."
