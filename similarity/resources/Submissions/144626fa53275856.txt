SUBMISSION 



*The narrow lane had closely set houses attached to one another. It was a rather dark night and the few street lights present were not lighted. There was no one on the street. Gaurav was standing opposite a small white house on one side of the lane. Huge pots of Tulsi hung over the small facade of the house. He looked at it very fondly.235B, Ranipur. * 

*This was the house where Gaurav was born and had spent the first 21 years of his life. He crossed the street and was about to knock the door only to realize it was locked and suddenly from out of nowhere a huge crawling creature showed up on the door. Gaurav was taken aback and moved away from the door. At that minute the door flung open on its own. A figure appeared which looked very pale and sick. It looked familiar but so ghostly was its appearance that Gaurav could not discern the features.* 

*Gaurav suddenly saw a small boy inside the house and was surprised to notice that the boy looked exactly like Gaurav did in his childhood. The boy ran away screaming. Gaurav felt terrorised by his surroundings and turned to run away from the house only to realize he was about to fall into an endless pit.* 

At this minute Gaurav opened his eyes. Beads of perspiration covered his forehead. He was relieved to realize that the circumstance he had seen himself in was just a bad dream. A terrible nightmare. It was 2:30 AM on a Wednesday. After twisting and tossing for a few minutes he went back to sleep. 

Gaurav is a highly qualified thirty five year old man. He is a VP of a big retail organisation. He has a lavish lifestyle. He earns more than he has the time to spend. He lives in a huge apartment, alone. Two years back his wife Kajal left him. Kajal and Gaurav were childhood sweethearts who had married at the young age of 24.The first few years of matrimony were delightful. They spent romantic evenings together and could also focus on their respective careers. Gaurav's acumen and intellect brought him rapid success.He was the youngest VP in his organization. 

'I asked for the report at 9:00 AM sharp Venkat.' Gaurav said curtly. 

A lanky, timid Venkat nodded his head and muttered something and left the room. 

Gaurav cussed silently to himself in an effort to control his temper. And buried himself in his work. 

At 10:30 AM, Venkat re-appeared with a document. With trembling hands and an obsequious body language handed it to Gaurav, who scanned it, raised an eyebrow as if startled by something. He then shot a sharp look at Venkat and hurled the paper at his face. 'Get the hell out of here and send DK.' 

Venkat scurried away like a prey that had escaped the clutches of its predator. 

Gaurav spent his late evenings in posh five star hotels. He met with various clients, arranged lavish parties to honour them. He joked, he cheered, he patted, and he agreed and he laughed to promote himself and to clinch worthy deals.This was a typical day in his life. He believed he was living it to the hilt. He had everything he wanted and this was his heaven. In his own world he was extremely prosperous. 

Success comes at a price. It is either at the cost of health or at the cost of mental peace or most of the times both. In Gaurav's case, he paid heavily with his health and also with the joy and stability matrimony is credited to bring. A materialistic wanderer, he started losing himself to alcohol and to other abominable indulgences. 

On his way back to his apartment that night, Varun called him. Varun and Gaurav were close friends. They had probably forgotten the time when the first bond of friendship was formed. They had seen each other through the thick and thin of school, college and early career and personal life. Due to the demands of their work schedules it would often be months before they could catch up but whenever they did each felt the same congeniality towards the other. 

'Hello Gaurav, I met Madan today at a mall. He told me that Kajal is going through with the divorce. The last we spoke on this subject you said you would want to work on the reconciliation. What happened to that?' inquired Varun. 

'*Arre yaar*! Who cares anymore! I received some notice from her lawyer. I have told mine to take care of it.' replied Gaurav 

'I thought things were improving between the two of you. Gaurav, please rethink on this. Let's meet this weekend'. Varun suggested 

'Come on Varun! It is not worth it. I will throw the money at the lawyer and get over with it. Anyway, I am off to Australia this weekend. This is a million dollar deal. If it comes through I will be set for life!' 

Although Gaurav had pretended to be nonchalant about it, he somewhere felt guilty. Guilty in his conscience? Or just unsure about what he wanted from life? He knew in his heart that something was wrong. Somewhere his ambition and arrogance had crushed Kajal's and his beautiful dream of togetherness. He was too egoistic to admit it; even to himself, but very often an undercurrent of remorse tugged his heart. Today also he dismissed these feelings when they arose in his heart. 

Varun had observed that in the past few years arrogance had become the predominant feature of Gaurav's personality. On numerous occasions in the past, he had shown off his power to belittle people around him. He hoped that Gaurav and Kajal would reconcile. Both of them were so close to him. They had all grown up in the same neighbourhood and Varun believed he had never seen a more wonderful couple. It was so unfortunate that they had parted. Varun regretted that Gaurav was entirely to blame. From a loving, gentle, friendly guy he had transformed into an egotistical, nasty man. Kajal had tried everything in her power to make things work. She truly cared for Gaurav. She had pleaded, reprimanded, argued and beseeched but nothing had worked. He did not want to start a family, did not give her time, did not respect and most of all deprived her of love and care. Their petty fights became more frequent and one day he hit her. Self-respecting Kajal could not take it anymore and she walked out of his house and his life. 

A few weeks after Gaurav returned from Australia Varun visited him. 

Varun: 'How was Australia?' 

Gaurav: 'Hey Varun, so glad to see you. Australia was good but there is something I need to talk to you about. 

'What happened Gaurav? You look very troubled and scared. What is wrong? Did something bad happen in Australia?' 

'No *yaar*. It is not Australia. All was good there. In fact my meeting went very well and looks like the deal will be mine. What the heck! Of course I will win it. I am a born winner.' He remarked confidently despite his drained countenance. 

'Then what is it that you want to talk to me about? You look as if something is bothering you.' 

'You are right Varun. Now this may seem weird to you but you are the only person I can share this with. I have been dreaming for the past few months now. I dream of our Ranipur...' 

'Really! Ohh how I wish we could go back there someday. So many memories Gaurav.' 

'Yes, in my dream I am back at Ranipur, you remember that blue house with the green gate. I am standing there and looking at mine. In the beginning of the dream I feel very happy and then....', his voice dropped as if he were absorbed in some abstract thoughts. 

Varun knew Gaurav very well. He knew Gaurav was a very practical man who would never give a second thought to unearthly things such as dreams unless it had really affected him. 

Gaurav narrated in detail the dream to Varun which he had seen so many times, probably every second day. 

'I agree it is a scary dream Gaurav, but why are you so bothered? It is just a dream after all.' 

'I know. I thought so too but the frequency at which it has been occurring it is bothering me. I see it day after day, evvveerrrry day. It is tiring me. I feel as if I must do something about it', admitted Gaurav. 

'Do you see the same details every day?' 

'Well! No.May be not exactly the same. There are minor variations but the theme and the mood of the dream is the same everyday'. 

'We can meet a counsellor Gaurav, but I do not know if they would help.' 

'I read somewhere that dreams are a reflection of your personality and that the subconscious guides you to some blah blah. I would not want to believe any of those but I still feel that I must go to Ranipur. It has been a long time and if nothing else it would be just a good break for the both of us. What say? So can you come along Varun?' 

'Of course I would love to. Although I do not know how that would help your situation but may be visiting Ranipur might get the bad dream out of your system.' 

And off they went to their beloved town where they had spent a very memorable childhood. They observed to each other how much it had changed and yet how much it still remained the same. The shop in the corner, the well by the wall, which had had no water but had always been filled with mud, the huge compound wall of the government college, the popular Meena hotel which was once the pride of the place, all had changed but still not so much. They laughed and joked as each shared his favourite part of past incidents. And finally the autorickshaw pulled into their *mohalla, * Ranipur. 

Both became completely absorbed in their surroundings. It seemed as if they were trying to assimilate the familiar smells, the sounds and every other dimension of the environment. They passed Kajal's house, then Mani's, then Raghu Uncle's, then the Sharma's and then approached Gaurav's childhood 

home. This property had been sold off by Gaurav's parents, long back and they had moved to Canada. Gaurav became aware of the fact that he was standing exactly in the same place as he had seen himself stand in the dream. A surge of fear gripped him for a fraction of a second. And then he realized that except the position everything else was different. It was broad day light, the place was flooded with people and Varun was beside him. 

They moved towards the house and knocked at what remained of the old wooden door, the brass plate shone and announced to its visitors that it was 235B, Ranipur. 

The door was opened by an old woman. 'Yakuuuuu!!' Gaurav cried in fondness and embraced her. 

'Yaku, This is Gaurav, Yaku..do you remember me?' 

Yakamma, his nanny, who was fondly called Yaku by the children, peered at his face. Her expressionless eyes suddenly gleamed with tears and she said 'Gaurav *bhaiyya*...oh how long you have been away! How have you grown but I can tell you in a crowd of a thousand people!' 

Gaurav felt like a child again. It seemed as if it hadn't been long since he had run around these streets refusing to eat food and a young Yaku running behind him scolding lovingly. He would run into her arms and the warmth of her soothing cotton saree would put him to sleep. He remembered the umpteen times she had 'stolen' tamarind and sweets for him. 

'*Namaste* Gaurav *bhaiyya*', cried a feeble voice. Gaurav turned to see Raghav, Yaku's son and Gaurav's playmate. Raghav had always been a tall, thin guy surprisingly strong for his lean structure. But now he looked sick as if a horrible disease was eating him away slowly. 

'*Arre* Raghav! How are you? Why do you look so dull?' Gaurav inquired. 

Before Raghav could respond, Yaku replied, '*Bhaiyya*, DK *sahib* is a horrible person. He knows about Raghav's illness but never fails to overwork him whenever he is here. He left two days back. God knows what he does. He comes and goes as he pleases. He has a very bad temper, shouts at us and abuses us all for no reason.' At this point Yakamma burst into tears and said incoherently, 'We have nowhere to go. This has been our home for so many years. You and your parents gave me shelter here, this is where my children grew up and this is where Reva died...'t this point she became hysterical and mumbled on, 'It has not been 6 months yet. How can we leave this place..?' 

'Who is DK *sahib* and what happened to Reva?' Gaurav asked sternly. 

'*Bhaiyya*, our landlord, how you forget!' chuckled Raghav 'Kajal *bhabhi*also met him when she came here two months back. Thank you so much for your help *bhaiyya*..' 

'Yes yes Gaurav *bhaiyya* thank you so much for the money you have been sending us. We did everything for Reva although we could not save her,' said Yakamma and started weeping again. 

Gaurav and Varun were very perplexed by now. What money? Why do Yaku and Raghav assume Gaurav to know everything about their life? It has been a decade since he met them or even heard of them. 

'Kajal *bhabhi* always said you are too busy or else you would have loved to come yourself. She said you spoke about us often. You are a rich man now but you are still kind to us. We are so grateful for your generosity *Bhaiyya*, I hope Raghav recovers. You have spent so much on him too.' 

'*Arre* *amma* will you bring *chai* or water at least? You are an eternal talker' chided Raghav. 

Varun and Gaurav conveyed to each other through glances that there was a lot to be clarified here and Kajal had something do with all this. They also communicated subtly to each other that in the interest of their obliging hosts, it was best to play along. 

An hour passed in friendly banter and Gaurav and Varun took off promising to visit them the next day. They checked into a lodge and the first thing Varun did was call up Kajal. He put it on speaker mode and Gaurav waited impatiently to hear what she knew about all this. 

'Kajal, I am here at Ranipur today. I met Yaku and family. What is their story *yaar*?', asked Varun unable to check his curious tone 

'Hey Varun, what made you go to Ranipur? Poor Yakamma and family are going through a bad phase.' She said in a sad voice. 'Do you remember Reva? She had blood cancer and died a few months back. Poor girl! But what is worst is that Raghav has it too. Something in their genes.' replied Kajal 

'Have you been visiting them? And have you lent them money? They said they were very much grateful to you', Varun inquired without revealing Gaurav's presence. 

'Yes, I send them money every month for treatment. I first went there a year ago because my old house there is involved in some legal issues. And you know, ever since papa and mama passed away there is no one to take care of that. Later I went there a couple of more times and could not help going into Gaurav's house. It always meant so much to me as a child Varun,' her voice trailed off. 'You know how it was our meeting point,' she said regaining her composure. 

Gaurav, who had been listening quietly till now, grabbed the phone from Varun and said, 'Kajal, Gaurav here. They were thanking *me* with all their heart. Did you not tell them about our separation? Why did you hide that? Why are you helping my nanny?' 

'Gaurav, what? You there too!' said a startled Kajal. 'Well', she said a little nervously. 'Gaurav, you, your house and your nanny were a vital part of my childhood. I loved all of those then and I shall love them forever. While I may have been a fool to think you would become the same Gaurav you were, I cannot deny that I never stopped loving you.' 

With a lump in his throat, Gaurav asked, 'You could have helped them as *you*, why did you tell them it was *me*.' 

'Gaurav, when I met them, they assumed we were ONE. They had more faith in *us* than we had in each other' Kajal said expressively. 'I did not want to break their heart so I told them we wanted to help them and that you sent me to meet them as you were busy. I want to help them, who they thank is not important to me. And anyway they always want to see you and me as one.' 

'Kajal, we must meet. Can we please meet when I return?' Gaurav asked in an emotional voice. 'I have been a fool, I know. I do not know what to say... but we must meet and sort all this out. Please promise me that you will meet me...' 

A few hours later, Gaurav fell asleep.* Gaurav was standing opposite a small white house on one side of a lane. Huge pots of Tulsi hung over the small facade of the house. The entire street was decorated as if a wedding was about to take place. There were people moving about festively. Gaurav noticed that this one house was adorned more beautifully than the others. He looked at it very fondly.235B, Ranipur. He crossed the street and was about to knock on the door. It was opened by Raghav who looked hale and hearty. Yaku, dressed in fine clothes embraced him. The next room was filled with his * 

*friends and the sound of laughter and merriment could be heard from it. A small girl came running towards him. It was Kajal as she was in her childhood. The very next minute she was a woman, decked up like a bride.* 

At this point, he woke up from his sleep. He smiled to himself and felt a strange peacefulness engulfing him. He knew what he would say to Kajal when he met her.
