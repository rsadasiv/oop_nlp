THE PENSION 

Madanlal Biswas looked at the office clock. It was ticking away, but it seemed to take an hour for every minute to pass by. He shifted some papers across his desk, stacked some files in a drawer, arranged the stationery neatly and looked up hopefully at the torturous timepiece. It was doing its work in a leisurely pace, much like the other staff in the insurance office, where Biswas worked as a senior clerk. He sighed to himself. They seemed perfectly happy to push around papers and go through thick files. Then why was he miserable, he thought wretchedly. 

Perhaps it was because he had been so ambitious as a young man. He had dreamt of money and excitement. His postmaster father, on the other hand, wanted his only son to get a stable income so that he could support the family. So Madanlal took the clerical job his father’s friend had reserved for him, leaving behind his grand plans. 

He would be retiring next month and would be free of the dreary paperwork he did for a living. He had to drag on, for the sake of the small pension he would receive, having worked all his life at the insurance company. After an eternity, it clocked five and he got up. 

As he walked along the cobbled street towards his lodgings, he noticed a small crowd gathered at a stall on the roadside. A closer look revealed that it was a lottery stall, and the cause of excitement was a prize. He pushed his way through, and heard that a customer had won 100 rupees, the smallest amount of prize money offered. 

“So much fuss for a trifling amount.” He thought to himself, disgusted, and left the cheering crowd behind. 

The devil probably lurks around corners, looking for such cynical souls, to wander along. For it was then that he struck Biswas with the depraved idea. 

By the time he reached home, Biswas had the entire plan of action ready. 

He rented a post box at the post office and placed an announcement in the advertisement section of all leading newspapers. 

The next day, the newspapers carried an inconspicuous advertisement written in small font and placed in the inner pages. It ran, 

“Invest in Phoenix Mutual Fund and get 40% rate of return. For more information, send us a mail at mutualfund@phoenix.com.” 

Over the ensuing days, the buzz at the insurance office was that the usually taciturn Mr. Biswas was being uncharacteristically genial, nodding merrily at colleagues and even wishing them a good day. When asked the reason behind his new found joviality. Biswas would simply shake his head and say, “It is merely the blissful thought of retiring after all these years and receiving my pension.” 

Biswas indeed found the days had become more bearable. He itched to check the mail to see how many flies he had ensnared in his web (he liked to think of himself as a spider who had spun an intricate web). The thought of his Grand Plan glowed inside him and contented him even as the humdrum office work surrounded him. 

Every day, he would reach home and open the mail to see a few new mails. 

Some were all set to get the 40% return. Biswas immediately sent such candidates a mail requesting them to fill out a form and send their investment, by cash, to Post Box Number 3145. 

Some were hovering between greed and suspicion. They wanted to know why Phoenix and Co. wanted their money in cash, when a cheque could do just as well. Biswas sent an understanding mail to them, patiently explaining that the Phoenix and Co. invested their money in other companies, which in turn required hard cash for their daily functioning. He further added an innuendo, hinting that in such cash transactions, there was no need to give the taxman his cut. 

He stretched back and massaged his aching neck. He had sent out around 50 emails in the last week. Now all he had to do was wait. He knew they would take their time to think it over. All of them wouldn’t revert. Perhaps most of them would back out. But he also knew that there would be few who would not be able to resist their greed, and the lure of the money would eventually draw them into his web. 

And sure enough, five of them replied, with the form duly filled, that they had sent their cash to the post box. Over the next few days the postbox, rented by Phoenix Ltd., was flooded with envelopes filled with cash. 

On the nineteenth day after placing the advertisement, Biswas decided that it was time to wind up the con. After all, the perfect stage artist knows the art of a timely exit, which is as important as his entry. 

Time at the office seemed to pass even more slowly that day. He restlessly arranged and rearranged the things on his desk. As soon as it struck five, Biswas got up and walked out, without so much as a “Goodbye” to anyone. That was to be his last day at work. 

The next day, the buzz at the insurance office was that the taciturn Mr. Biswas had suddenly resigned, a month before he was due to retire. A few curious people went to his lodgings, and confirmed that it was indeed the case. His landlord had confirmed that he had packed up and left in the morning, but had left no address as to where he would be going. 

A few days later, the local newspapers reported that some people had been swindled by a fraudulent company named Phoenix. It was a by-line on the fifth page, and neither the police nor the reporters bothered to follow it up.

Madanlal Biswas was staying in the city he had always dreamed about, albeit under a pseudo name. He had rented a room at a posh hotel, which also meant he could use its conference room as an "office". He requested the hotel staff to provide him some paper and pens and a telephone at his disposal. It was from here that he made two calls. One was to a bank where he wanted to open an account. He was assured that a bank employee would come over with the form. The second was to an advertiser who distributed pamphlets. Satisfied with the response, Biswas made a final call. It was to an old age home, the residence of his ailing father. Biswas informed his father that inspite of his determined effort to stamp out his son’s potential, destiny had prevailed. The old man, unable to hear much over the telephone, was simply glad that his son had called.

Inspector Subraminiam was also due to retire next month, after serving twentytwo years in the police force. He was sitting at his desk in the police station, reading the newspaper while sipping a hot cup of tea, as was his habit. A flyer fell out of the newspaper, and was picked up by his deputy, Sub-Inspector Vakil. 

“See this, sir,” Vakil read out, “‘Invest Rs. 1000 and get 1500 back! 50% premium offered by Goldman & Co. Offer valid for limited time. Hurry!’ I’m sure this is a fraud. These conmen should be caught.” 

The Inspector smiled, “There are murderers and rapists at large, Vakil. We need to catch hold of them. This fraud business is small fry. I’m sure this conman will learn his lesson sooner or later. Now, get me your report of the Malhotra murder case. I want to solve it before I retire.” 

As Vakil hurried off, Subraminiam gave a last glance at the flyer, before returning to the newspaper. 

********************************************************************************************* 

Biswas’ second scam was as successful as his first. He had managed to gather enough money to leave the country, he told himself. This would be his last con. Or perhaps not. The entire process of planning a con and carrying it out gave him a high. The anxiety of executing the deception on unsuspecting strangers, and the euphoria when it played off, was addicting. The greedy and gullible deserved to lose their money, he reasoned. Maybe he would be a global con artist, relieving all materialistic souls of their money. It was time to wind up this scheme, and leave the country forever. 

Biswas was all set to wrap up his work, when he heard a knock at the door. An old gentleman, carrying a gold-handled stick and wearing a tailored suit entered. 

“How can I help you, sir?” Biswas ushered him in. 

“My name is Shekhar Virani. I read your advertisement, and I would like to invest some of my savings in your fund.” The old man said in a hoarse voice. 

“Of course, sir. You’re just in luck, Today’s the last day of the offer.” 

“Oh is it? That’s so sad. I was going to invest ten lakh rupees as a test amount, and if the offer came good, just as you said, then I would have invested my entire pension, about one crore rupees.” 

Biswas struggled to keep his face straight, but could not resist licking his lips. 

“I’ll see what I can do, sir. Let me make a phone call to our head office and ask.” He said in a conciliatory tone. 

He went out of the office, and returned after a while. 

“I have good news for you, sir. Our head office had decided to extend the offer till next week.” 

“That’s wonderful.” The old man beamed. “Shall I give you a cheque of ten lakh right now? I would have given you the entire crore but my son insists I first invest a test amount, and get it back before putting in the whole lump sum. One always hears of these frauds these days, you know, one has to be sure.” 

“Rest assured, sir, you have invested with the best. We don’t accept cheques, though. I’ll give you the company’s account number. Could you transfer the amount to the account?” 

“That suits me.” The gentleman got up to leave. “I’ll wire the amount to your account. And I’ll keep the rest of the money ready. I’ll wire it to you as soon as I receive fifteen lakh rupees from your company.” 

“I’ll personally oversee your transaction, and get it done as fast as I can. Thank you sir. Have a good day.” 

That night, he got a message from the bank that ten lakh rupees had been deposited to his account. He opened his bank statement online, and saw that he now had twenty lakh rupees. For a split second, he thought about ending the chapter and making off with all the money. Then avarice took over sagacity. He struggled with himself for a moment, then sent fifteen lakh rupees to old Mr. Virani. 

The next day was the longest day in Biswas’ life. He checked his phone, then his mail, then phone again, every minute. There was no sign of Mr. Virani. He had almost lost hope, when there was a knock at his door. A bellboy had brought an envelope. Heart beating fast, he snatched the envelope and slammed the door without so much as a ‘Thank you’. 

He tore it open and shook out its­ contents with shaking hands. It contained a note written in a spidery handwriting: Thank you for my pension. 

********************************************************************************************* 

“Yes, sir, Malhotra murder case is done before you left.” 

“Did I not tell you, Vakil?” 

“Yes you did sir. By the way, sir, I’ve been meaning to ask you this for some days.” 

“Yes, Vakil?” 

“We don’t get that pamphlet assuring 50% return anymore. I thought it was a con, and they ran off with the money. But we haven’t received any complaint yet. Strange, isn’t it?” 

“Perhaps they learnt their lesson, Vakil.” Inspector Subraminiam smiled, and wrote ‘Case closed’ on the Malhotra murder file in a spidery handwriting.
