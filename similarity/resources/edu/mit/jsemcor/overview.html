JSemcor was designed to be an easy-to-use, easy-to-extend Java library for 
interfacing with the Semcor electronic concordance.  It features API calls 
to retrieve context objects, paragraphs, sentences and tokens from the Semcor 
data files.  It also has classes that allow the user to interface to the taglist 
index files (if available) and the permit ‘detokenization’ of the texts back into 
human-readable form. The library includes no GUI elements.
<p>
JSemcor supports all currently available versions of Semcor.  
No version of Semcor is included with the JSemcor distribution; Semcor must be 
downloaded separately from Rada Milhacea’s website at 
<a href="http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/downloads.html">http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/downloads.html</a>.
<p>
The freely available version of JSemcor is licensed for use for 
non-commercial purposes only, as long as proper acknowledgment is made.  
Details can be found in the license, which is included with the distribution.

<p>
The main interface for accessing concordance data is the {@link edu.mit.jsemcor.main.IConcordanceSet} 
interface.  The distribution comes with 
a single default implementation of this interface, 
the {@link edu.mit.jsemcor.main.Semcor} class.  In the simplest case, where you are using 
data files on the same filesystem as your Java program, 
you can instantiate the {@link edu.mit.jsemcor.main.Semcor} class with a single argument, 
a Java {@link java.net.URL} object that points to the directory where the Semcor concordance 
data files are located.
<p>
An example of this can be found in below, in the form of a Java method 
<tt>testSemcor()</tt>.  In that method, the first block of two lines (4-5) 
deals with constructing a {@link java.net.URL} object that points to the Semcor data files.  
The base Semcor directory is the directory that contains the subdirectories 
<tt>brown1</tt>, <tt>brown2</tt>, and <tt>brownv</tt>.  In this example, it 
is assumed that the Semcor zip file was unzipped to the location “C:\Semcor\”.  
This may be different on your system depending on where you choose to put your 
Semcor files.  The second block of code, two lines long (8-9), constructs an 
instance of the default Semcor object, and opens it by calling the 
<tt>open()</tt> method.  The next block of lines (12-14) retrieves the first 
context file from the concordance by name, and retrieves the first sentence of 
that context file by direct access.  Following that, lines 17-23 comprise a 
simple for loop searches for the first wordform in that sentence that has an 
assigned sense. Once that word form is found, some salient characteristics are 
printed to the console on lines 26-28.  The text following the example code 
shows the console output of the method.

<p>
Sample Code:
<pre>
1   public void testSemcor() throws IOException {
2	
3     // construct the URL to the Semcor directory
4     String path = "C:/Semcor/";
5     URL url = new URL("file", null, path);
6
7     // construct the semcor object and open it
8     IConcordanceSet semcor = new Semcor(url);
9     semcor.open();
10
11    // look up first sentence of first context
12    IConcordance concord = semcor.get("brown1");
13    IContext context = concord.getContext("br-a01");
14    ISentence sentence = context.getSentences().get(0);
15
16    // find first word with non-null sense
17    IWordform wordform = null;
18    for(IWordform wf : sentence.getWordList()){
19      if(wf.getSemanticTag() != null){
20          wordform = wf;
21          break;
22      }
23    }
24
25    // print it
26    System.out.println("Text = " + wordform.getText());
27    System.out.println("POS = " + wordform.getPOSTag().getValue());
28    System.out.println("Sense Key = " + wordform.getSemanticTag().getSenseKeys().get(0));
29  }
</pre>
<p>
Sample Code Output:
<pre>
1  Text = Fulton County Grand Jury
2  POS = NNP
3  Sense Key = group%1:03:00::
</pre>
