Judith Cook (9 July 1933 â€“ 12 May 2004) was an anti-nuclear campaigner, historical novelist, journalist and lecturer in theatre at the University of Exeter. She wrote several mysteries based on the casebooks of Dr Simon Forman, an Elizabethan doctor and astrologer.

Through the columns of the Guardian women's page, edited by Mary Stott, she founded the anti-nuclear organisation Voice of Women after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when the world seemed on the verge of nuclear war.
