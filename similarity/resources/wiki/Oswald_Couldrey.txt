In that book he paid rich tributes to Telugu language "our Indian neighbours conscious of vague but proud tradition of ancient empire prefer to speak of Andhra Country. They talk Telugu, the northernmost and farthest spread and sweetest sounding of four great Dravidian languages".[5] After Adivi Bapiraju died in September 1952, Mr. Couldrey wrote an article on him titled as "Memories of Adivi Bapirazu" This article in Triveni July 1953.
