Charles Best (1570â€“1627) was an English poet.

He was a contributor to Francis Davison's Poetical Rapsodie (1608). The first edition of that anthology contains two pieces by Best, A Sonnet of the Sun (eighteen lines) and A Sonnet of the Moon. To the third edition (1611) he contributed An Epitaph on Henry Fourth, the last French King, An Epitaph on Queen Elizabeth, Union's Jewell, 'A Panegyrick to my Sovereign Lord the King,' and a few other pieces.
