Herbert Dixon Asquith (11 March 1881 – 5 August 1947) was an English poet, novelist, and lawyer.

Nicknamed "Beb" by his family, he was the second son of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister — with whom he is frequently confused — and younger brother of Raymond Asquith. His wife Lady Cynthia Asquith, whom he married in 1910, the daughter of Hugo Richard Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss and Mary Constance Wyndham, was also a writer.

Asquith was greatly affected by his service with the Royal Artillery in World War I.[1] His poems include "The Volunteer" and "The Fallen Subaltern", the latter being a tribute to fallen soldiers; his poem "Soldiers at Peace" was set to music by Ina Boyle. His novels include the best-selling Young Orland set during and after the First World War; Wind's End; Mary Dallon; and Roon.
