Michael Cordy is a British novelist.[1] He was born in Accra, the capital of Ghana.  Cordy spent much of his childhood in both West Africa and East Africa, India and Cyprus.  He was educated in the United Kingdom at The King's School, Canterbury, and the universities of Leicester and Durham.  After ten years in marketing and advertising, with his wife's encouragement, he became a novelist.  His first novel, The Miracle Strain, took two years to complete and was published in 1997.  Disney bought the film rights for $1.6 million and the novel reached no. 5 in The Sunday Times Bestseller list.  An international success, it has since been published in more than twenty-five languages and over forty countries.  Dan Brown published The Da Vinci Code in 2003, and its success may have influenced the renaming of Cordy's first three novels.  In spite of publishing six years earlier, he has been criticised of imitating Dan Brown.

Michael Cordy lives in London with Jenny, his wife, and their daughter, Phoebe.  Currently, he is working under contract on his first screenplay, Crime Zero, having recently sold the film rights option to  a subsidiary of Warner Bros. – New line Cinema.

Cordy is the author of six novels:
