Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy (12 September 1812 – 17 January 1878) was an English historian and jurist.

He was born the son of a Land Agent in Bexley, Kent, England and educated at Eton College (where he won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1831) and King's College, Cambridge. He was called to the Bar in 1837[1] and appointed assistant judge at the Westminster sessions court.[2]

In 1840, he began teaching history at the University of London and wrote a number of historical books including The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World (1851).

Creasy was knighted in 1860, and spent the next decade and a half in Ceylon as Chief Justice of Ceylon (1860 to 1875). He then returned in poor health to England and died in London on 17 January 1878.

Whilst in Ceylon he served as President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1861 to 1864.[3] In July, 1864 Creasy founded the Colombo Rowing Club.

Creasy's best known contribution to literature is his Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World (1851). It is typical of 19th century European sentiment, highly Eurocentric, with references to the barbarism and immorality of non-Europeans.[4] The reason Creasy gives for the significance of many of the fifteen battles, is that they denied Eastern peoples access to European soil.[citation needed] Other battles are seen as "decisive" because they shaped the development of Britain, which was the world's leading power at the time of writing.[citation needed]

Other works included are:

Old Love and the New (1870) was a novel. With John Sheehan and Robert Gordon Latham, Creasy took part in contributing to Bentley's Miscellany the political squibs in verse known as the Tipperary Papers.[5]
