Mary, Lady Carey (née Jackson, later Peyler; c. 1609 – c. 1680) was the author of poems and meditations.

Mary Carey was the daughter of Sir John Jackson. She married Pelham Carey, son of Henry, 4th Lord Hunsdon (whom King James I had created Viscount Rochford on 6 July 1621; he was later created 1st Earl of Dover by King Charles I). She subsequently married George Peyler, although she was always known as Lady Carey.[1]
