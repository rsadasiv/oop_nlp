Trezza Azzopardi (born 1961) is a British writer.

Azzopardi was born in Cardiff to a Maltese father and a Welsh mother. She studied creative writing at the University of East Anglia, and currently works as a lecturer there. She also has an MA in Film and Television studies from the University of Derby.

Her first novel, The Hiding Place, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2000 (a significant accomplishment, since first novels are not often shortlisted for the Booker). Her novel also won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and was also shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Her second novel, "Remember Me", was shortlisted for the Wales Book of the Year. "Winterton Blue" was longlisted for the 2008 Wales Book of the Year. She also writes short stories, and readings for BBC radio. Her books have been translated into 17 languages.

Azzopardi currently lives in Norwich, in the east of England.
