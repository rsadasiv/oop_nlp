John Aglionby (died ca. 1610) was an eminent divine, of a family whose name was De Aguilon, corrupted into Aglionby. The son of Edward Aglionby and Elizabeth Musgrave, of Crookdayke, he was admitted as a student to Queen's College, Oxford in 1583. He went into orders and became an eloquent preacher. He traveled abroad, where he formed an acquaintance with cardinal Bellarmine; on his return was made chaplain to Elizabeth, and took his degree of D.D. in 1600. He took a considerable share in the translation of the New Testament ordered by King James I, to whom he was also chaplain; and his name occurs among those of other Oxford divines, who were to translate the Gospels, Acts, and Apocalypse.

Dr. Aglionby died at Islip, 6 Feb. 1609/10, aged 43. He was deeply read in the fathers, and also a distinguished scholar and critic.
