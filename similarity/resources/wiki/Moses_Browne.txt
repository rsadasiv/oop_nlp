Moses Browne (1704 – September 1787), born in Severn Stoke, Worcestershire, England, became a pen-cutter in Clerkenwell, London, after the death of his patron, Lord Molesworth, in 1725.[1] He became a poet, and in middle age a clergyman of the Church of England.

Browne contributed poems to The Gentleman's Magazine, winning several prizes from its founder.[1] During this time, Browne would be mixing with some of the distinguished literary figures of the time, including Samuel Johnson.[citation needed]

Moses Browne married Ann Wibourne in 1738 in Clerkenwell. He had in excess of nine children – some records indicate up to 13. His great-great-great-grandson was to be the stage-performing mnemonist Edward Cyril De Hault Laston.[citation needed]

Browne found success as a devotional writer, and on the instigation of the evangelical writer James Hervey, was ordained in 1753.[1] He was then appointed vicar of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1753. In 1764, Browne took the additional post of Chaplain at Morden College in Blackheath, London, one of the reasons being that his Olney post could not sustain such a large family. However, he remained Vicar of Olney at the same time as Vicar of Sutton, Lincolnshire until his death in 1787.[2]
