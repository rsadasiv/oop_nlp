Anna Maria Bennett (ca. 1750[1] â€“ 12 February 1808) was a Welsh novelist who wrote in English.  Some sources give her name as Agnes Maria Bennett. She had two children and she taught her daughter to act and she became a noted stage actor.

Her best-known work is the epistolary novel Agnes de-Courci (1789).

Anna was probably born in Merthyr Tydfil[2] Glamorganshire, Wales, the daughter of David Evans, described variously as a customs officer or grocer. She was briefly married to customs officer Thomas Bennett, but while sheltering in a chandler's shop after moving to London, she met Vice-Admiral Thomas Pye.[3] She became his housekeeper and mistress in Tooting, Surrey.[4] 

The couple had at least two illegitimate children together, Thomas Pye Bennett and Harriet Pye Bennett. The latter became a famous actress as Harriet Pye Esten, with her mother helping to launch her career.[4] 

When Admiral Pye died he left his Suffulk Street townhouse to Bennett and the families joined more confusingly when their son Thomas Pye Bennett married the Admiral's daughter Mary.[5]

Her daughter, Harriet Pye Esten, initially appeared in Bath and Bristol before moving on to appear in Dublin. Whilst she was there in 1789 she and her mother negotiated a formal separation with James Esten. Bennett paid off her son-in-law's debts in exchange for his agreement.[6]
