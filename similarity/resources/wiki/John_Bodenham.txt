John Bodenham (c. 1559 – 1610), an English anthologist, was the patron of some of the Elizabethan poetry anthologies.

He was the son of William Bodnam and Katherine Wanton.
He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School.[1]

Mr. Bullen says that Bodenham did not himself edit any of the Elizabethan miscellanies attributed to him by bibliographers: but that he projected their publication, and he befriended the editors.[2]
