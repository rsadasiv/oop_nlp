Rev. Pender Hodge Cudlip (1835–1911) was an English Anglican High Church clergyman, theologian and writer. He was a well-known preacher in Cornwall and Devon during the mid to late 19th century, spent several years in Paddington, London, and held Sparkwell Vicarage from 1884 until his death. As the husband of writer Annie Hall Cudlip, née Thomas, he himself published a series of books on religion and theology between 1895 and 1905.

Pender Hodge Cudlip was born to William Edgecombe Cudlip in Porthleven near Helston, Cornwall in April 1835.[1] He attended the University of Oxford, matriculating on 25 April 1855 and eventually received degrees from Magdalen Hall,[2] his BA in 1858 and MA four years later.[3][4][5] While attending Oxford, Cudlip co-wrote an article, Music, with Tremenheere Johns and Pascoe Grenfell Hill for the Helston Grammar School Magazine.[1]

Cudlip was ordained a deacon in 1860, then a preacher by the Bishop of Exeter the following year.[5] He served as clergyman in Buckfastleigh during this time and, following his appointment, served in Modbury from 1861 to 1866. In 1867, while curate in Yealmpton,[3] he began courting Annie Hall Thomas and the two were married on 10 July that year.[2][6][7][8][9] The couple had six children, of whom only three survived into adulthood.[10] One of his daughters later married Major William Price Drury, a Royal Marine, who wrote some nautical novels at the end of the century.[11]

The couple lived in Devon for most of their married lives, except for the period 1873–84 spent in Paddington, London.[12] Thereafter Cudlip was vicar of Sparkwell for 25 years.[2][4] He also held the title of Rural Dean of Plympton.[5] Before his death in 1911, Cudlip published a series of books on religion, including Bible Worship or The Continuity of Sacrificial Worship (1895), Meditations On The Revelations Of The Resurrection (1896), Why I Should Be Confirmed? (1898) and The Eucharistic Glory Of The Incarnation (1904).
