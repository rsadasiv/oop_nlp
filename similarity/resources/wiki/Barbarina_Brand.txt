Barbarina Brand, Lady Dacre (née Ogle; 1768–1854), was an English poet, playwright, and translator.

She was the daughter of Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, 1st Baronet (died 1816), and Hester Thomas (daughter of John Thomas, Bishop of Winchester). In 1789 Barbarina married Valentine Henry Wilmot, an officer in the guards, though they later separated. The couple had one daughter, Arabella Jane (Wilmont) Sullivan (1796–1839). After Wilmot's death in 1819 she married Thomas Brand, 20th Baron Dacre (1774–1851), later that same year.

Educated at home, she became "one of the most accomplished women of her time":[1] in addition to her writing, she sculpted, rode, was proficient in both French and Italian, and maintained an extensive correspondence with a circle of other literary women, including Joanna Baillie, Mary Russell Mitford, and Catherine Maria Fanshawe.

Her final years were marred by the death of her daughter Arabella Sullivan in 1839, and by the loss of her hearing.  She died May 17, 1854.[2]
