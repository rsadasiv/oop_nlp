Emily Frederick Clark (fl. 1798–1833) was an English novelist and poet. She was the daughter of a customs official named Clark (died 1824) and his wife Elizabeth (died 1825), who was the daughter of Felice Frederick (c. 1725–1797). On the title pages of her novels she made unsubstantiated claims to be the great-granddaughter of Theodore, King of Corsica. Several of her novels were set in the Welsh countryside. Press attention to her work dwindled and she waged a lifelong battle against penury. Twenty-four of her 42 applications to the Royal Literary Fund were successful; nothing more is known of her after the last was sent in 1833.
