Balasubramanyam's first novel,In Beautiful Disguises was the winner of a Betty Trask Prize in 1999 before it was even published. It was later accepted by Bloomsbury, and went on to be nominated for the Guardian Fiction Award, and to be shortlisted for the BBC Asia Prize. The Guardian described it as, 'Colourful, spirited and crackling with charm. It is easy to see why Balasubramanyam is already and Betty Trask Winner'. Nadeem Aslam commented that it was, 'The best first novel since I canâ€™t remember when. I made nine pages of closely written notes on its various metaphors, insights and similes. Brilliant!'

2010 saw the publication of Balasubramanyam's long-awaited second novel, The Dreamer, based on a short story which won an Ian St James Prize in 2001. It is the story of Shashi, a British-Asian actor who suffers a nervous breakdown and takes to his bed whereupon his dreams take on a life of their own. India Today described it as 'a meditative, haunting experiment in stream of consciousness' with 'evocative, sweetly melancholic lines sprinkled through the length of the book'.
