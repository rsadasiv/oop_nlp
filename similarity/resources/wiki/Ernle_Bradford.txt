Ernle Dusgate Selby Bradford (11 January 1922, Cole Green, Norfolk, England – 8 May 1986) was a noted 20th-century British historian specializing in the Mediterranean world and naval topics. A keen yachtsman himself, Bradford spent almost 30 years sailing the Mediterranean, and many of his books are set there. His book, The Journeying Moon describes some of these voyages. It ends with the sale of his Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter, Mischief, to HW Bill Tilman, who made a number of significant voyages in it to high latitudes. Bradford lived in Kalkara, Malta for a number of years. Sometime BBC broadcaster and magazine editor, Bradford was a prolific author.

The son of Jocelyn Ernle Sydney Patton Bradford and his wife, Ada Louise Dusgate, he was educated at Uppingham School, Rutland.  He also served in the Royal Navy during World War II, finishing as the first Lieutenant of a destroyer.[1]
