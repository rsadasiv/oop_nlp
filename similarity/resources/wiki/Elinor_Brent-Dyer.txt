Elinor M. Brent-Dyer (6 April 1894 â€“ 20 September 1969) was a children's author who wrote more than 100 books during her lifetime, the most famous being the Chalet School series.[1]

Brent-Dyer was born Gladys Eleanor May Dyer on 6 April 1894, in South Shields.[2] She was the only daughter of Charles Morris Brent-Dyer, a surveyor, and Eleanor Watson Rutherford.[1] Her father left the family when she was three years old, and her mother remarried in 1913.[2] In 1912, her younger brother Henzell died of meningitis.[2]

Brent-Dyer was educated privately at a small school in South Shields until 1912, and shortly afterwards trained to teach at City of Leeds Training College.[1] She taught a variety of subjects at both state and private schools, and ran a Girl Guide group.[1] In the 1920s, she briefly studied music under Edgar Bainton at the Newcastle Conservatoire.[1]

Brent-Dyer's first book, Gerry Goes to School, was published in 1922 and became the first of the La Rochelle series.

She was inspired to write her popular Chalet School series after holidaying in the Austrian Tyrol at Pertisau-am-Achensee.[2] The first book in the series, The School at the Chalet, was published in 1923.

Although she was raised as an Anglican, she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1930.[1]

In 1933, Brent-Dyer and her mother moved to Hereford, where Brent-Dyer was employed as a governess in Peterchurch.[2][1] In 1938, she opened her own school, the Margaret Roper School, but it closed in 1948. She then dedicated all of her time to writing.[2]

Following her mother's death in 1957, Brent-Dyer moved to Redhill to live with Phyllis Matthewman, who was also a children's novelist.[1] She died there in 1969, and her final book was published posthumously the same year.
