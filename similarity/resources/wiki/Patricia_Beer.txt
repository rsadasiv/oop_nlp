Patricia Beer (4 November 1924 â€“ 15 August 1999) was an English poet and critic.[1]

She was born in Exmouth, Devon into a family of Plymouth Brethren. Her mother died when she was fourteen and it affected her entire life and the way she saw death. Patricia Beer was strongly influenced by the Plymouth Brethren Church, a loosely structured, fundamentalist sect. She moved away from her religious background as a young adult, becoming a teacher and academic. She began to write poetry after World War II, while living in Italy; she is most often classified as a 'New Romantic' poet comparable to John Heath-Stubbs. On her own account, however, there is a discontinuity in her work. Devon is a major presence.[2]

She was married twice; first to the writer P.N. Furbank, and then to Damien Parsons, an architect, settling in Upottery, near Honiton, England.  From the later 1960s she wrote full-time. She edited several significant anthologies, broadcast, and contributed to literary reviews.
