John Conybeare DD (31 January 1692 â€“ 13 July 1755) was Bishop of Bristol and one of the most notable theologians of the 18th century.

Conybeare was born at Pinhoe, where his father was vicar, and educated at Blundell's School and Exeter College, Oxford. He was elected a Probationary Fellow of Exeter College in 1710, took his B.A. degree in 1713 and was appointed a year later as Praelector in Philosophy.

On 27 May 1716 Conybeare was ordained as a priest by the Bishop of Winchester, Sir Jonathan Trelawney and took a curacy in Surrey. He returned to Oxford a year later and became a well known preacher.

His subsequent appointments included:

Conybeare was known for the publication of his book Calumny Refuted, an answer to the personal slander of Dr. Richard Newton.

Conybeare was the father of Dr William Conybeare, the well known rector of Bishopsgate, and grandfather to the famous geologist William Conybeare. He is buried in Bristol Cathedral.
