Peter Marcus "Mark" Adlard (born 19 June 1932 in Seaton Carew[1]) is an English novelist.

The son of Arthur Marcus Adlard, an auctioneer, and Ethel (n√©e Leech), Adlard was educated at the University of London (B.Sc.), Trinity College, Cambridge (M.A. 1954) and the Department of Education at Oxford. Aside from writing, his career has been spent in management positions in the steel industry.[2]

Adlard's best-known works are the social science fiction novels Interface, Volteface, and MultiFace.[1] published in the early 1970s. The novels concern T-city, a 22nd-century domed megacity covering the entirety of the English North Eastern industrial area between the River Tyne and the River Tees.

A later novel, The Greenlander (1978) concerns the whaling industry in Northeast England during the early days of steam-powered shipping. This was intended to be the first of a series but, to date, no further volumes have appeared.
