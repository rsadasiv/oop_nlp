George Gordon Coulton FBA (15 October 1858 â€“ 4 March 1947) was a British historian, known for numerous works on medieval history. He was known also as a keen controversialist.[1]

He was born in King's Lynn. He was educated at Lynn Grammar School, and Felsted School, and St Catharine's College, Cambridge.[2]

He taught for a short period, and was ordained in 1883. He did not however pursue a life in the Church of England, due to the absence of vocation, and took further teaching jobs, beginning as an independent scholar to study the history of the Middle Ages. A fierce anti-Catholic, he was often, especially during the 1930s, embroiled in embittered journalistic controversy with Hilaire Belloc, who detested him.

In 1911 Coulton found a lecturing position at the University of Cambridge. He became a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1919, a Fellow of the British Academy in 1929.
