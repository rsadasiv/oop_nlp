I looked around the room.  Everything was as it always had been.  The old gray chair still sat in the farthest corner of the room.  The painting depicting autumn in the forest remained on the east wall. Even those pictures of long-dead family members were still there, standing upright.  They looked grand in those pictures.  There was just something about the photos taken from 1920s to the 1950s that really stood the test of time.          I got up not knowing where I was heading.  All I knew was that I had to get out of that room for a bit.  I felt sick inside.  I didn't feel sick physically as much as I did emotionally.  That dream had stirred me up.          It's funny how an individual can simply pass off most dreams; then one comes along which the person can't shake.  It stays with him or her, sometimes for days.  That's the type of dream I had just had, the latter.          I remember the dream vividly.         I woke up in that same chair I had just gotten out of and realized there was something very different about my living room.  It was empty.  It seemed that way at first at least.  Then I noticed something.  The portraits of the family members that rested on the mantle, they were turned face down.  Why?           I slowly walked over to the mantle.  I was about to pick up the first portrait, one of my mother's maternal grandparents. Then I heard the door close, and people talking.  It sounded like a man and a woman.  Turning around, I saw them.  There they were!  My great-grandparents! They had their backs to me, but it was them.  "Wow," I thought, "how can this be real?"  But it had to be.  They were right before my eyes.         I approached them without hesitation.  "Hello," I said. They didn't respond.  They carried on their conversation.  I rubbed my eyes.  When I looked up again, the setting had changed.  I was in their house, and they still stood their, talking to each other with their backs to me.  It was their living room.  Everything looked as I remembered it.  I remembered it so well.         I tried once again to make contact; no luck.  I turned around and started walking towards the spare bedroom entrance, which was about ten feet away. I hadn't a clue why I was walking there. I noticed the door was closed.  I knocked.  It felt real. It was real.  I heard a man say, "Hold on!"  I replied, "No rush."          Five seconds later, the handle turned and the door swung open.  There stood a man of probably nineteen dressed in a nice early twentieth-century black suit and a derby hat.  He said, "Hey Henry.  How are you?"  "I'm fine," I answered.  He laughed.  It was a laugh that sounded faintly familiar to me.  It was a unique laugh, very unique. I couldn't place where I had heard it before. He looked at me and said,"I was waiting for you, Henry.  I was afraid you wouldn't show.  Henry, good old Henry.  My old chum.  Come on, we have to hurry.  Go take a look in the mirror before we go.  You've got some hair sticking up in the back. I don't think the ladies will be too impressed."  He nudged me in the ribs and headed for the door, laughing.          I walked into the bedroom that he had just walked out of and found a full-length mirror.  Something was wrong, very wrong.  That wasn't me.  No, that wasn't me at all.  My facial features were much different.  That hair was not mine.  I was a bit taller now.  I was also dressed in one of those black suits.  I stood there looking at myself, but it wasn't me physically.          I heard footsteps coming toward me rapidly.  It was him again.  He smacked the back of my head and pulled my hair down, all in one motion.  He laughed again.  "Henry," he said, "We must be punctual.  No time for us to play in front of the mirror."  He walked toward the door again.  I followed him.         We walked out the door and onto the sidewalk.  I looked to each side.  Giant elms hung over the street.  There were great old homes on each side.  I hadn't been here before, or had I?  In a way, I felt that perhaps I had once known this place.  A car drove by us, a very old car.  I wondered like I had never wondered before.         He was way ahead of me.  He was obviously in a hurry.  "Come on, Henry!  Hurry it up, will you?" he shouted.  I picked up my pace. I saw him turn right about fifty feet in front of me and approach a large white home.  As I neared it,  I realized that it was a Victorian home, white with green trim.  There was a large front porch and there was a small group of people sitting on it.  They were all dressed in early twentieth-century clothing too.  That man was talking to them.  Who was he?          Upon reaching the residence, I turned right and walked toward that porch.  I felt so out of place, yet I didn't.  I stepped up onto the structure hesitantly.  "Come on, Henry!  No need to be scared," he said,  "I don't know what your problem is today, old boy."             I had a better look at them now.  There was a middle-aged man dressed in what was probably his finest suit.  It was jet black.  Every suit I had seen thus far was black.  To his right was a woman roughly his age or just a bit younger.  She was all dressed up too.  She wore a floral dress.  The flowers on it were yellow and white, and the background was red.  Sitting beside the patriarch and matriarch of this family were their children.  The daughter was seated to her mother's right.  She was probably seventeen or eighteen.  Her face was hidden by her cloche hat.  She seemed to have her mind on other things.  She really paid no attention to my "friend" or me.  The son was seated next to his sister.  He looked out toward the street and paid us no mind as well. He was probably my age, nineteen. What a surprise; he was also dressed in a jet black suit.        "So, James, what troubles your friend today?" the father asked.  That was his name, James.  I decided to speak up.  "Oh, nothing much, sir," I interjected, "I'm sorry."  "No trouble," he replied, "Now let's get on with business."  Business?  I decided to be quiet and listen so that I could find out more.         "This just isn't working," the father continued, looking at James, "These cabinets you sold me, they're just not installed properly.  I understand that you're trying to finance your journey through medical school, but you are going about it all wrong.  Take it from a self-made man:  Please your customers, and you'll find that in the end, things work out much better.  Now the family and I are about to go out to dinner, so nothing will be done this evening.  However, I want you here tomorrow morning at nine.  Being an old friend of your father's, I trust that you'll rectify this problem for me."  James, who had been looking down throughout the patriarch's little speech, raised his head and replied, "I'm very sorry, Mr. Berkley.  I will fix this.  It was just an honest mistake.  You're cabinets will be in tip-top shape after I'm done."  James then shook Mr. Berkley's hand and walked down the porch steps and back to the sidewalk.  I followed.          I decided not to be so reserved anymore.  As we walked down the street, I asked James where we were going.  He said, "We're off to the docks, old pal. I'm sorry for taking you along with me to the Berkleys' home, but I figured I should just go ahead and get it over with now.  After tomorrow morning, I won't have to deal with that screwy crew anymore.  I should have found some other way to make money.  I just thought selling cabinets would be easier than it really is.  Oh well, I'll forget about it all for now."  We walked down a couple of blocks, and then we turned right and went down a couple more.  There was the lake.  It was quite large.  James exclaimed, "There's the gang!  They're over there waiting for us.  Come on, Henry, no time to waste!"  He sprinted through the grass and towards the nearest dock.  Sure enough, there was a group of people standing on it.  They were all waving.  I sprinted over too.         I was beginning to notice that I had limited control over my actions.  It was like I was inside another person, and I was just along for the ride.  I felt that my speech was about all I could control. But then again, it seemed scripted somehow.  Everything seemed predetermined.         I was soon on the dock.  I walked over to "the gang" and said, "Hello. How are all of you this evening?"  Of course, I was bombarded with answers, but each response was either "splendid," "lovely," or "swell."  I certainly wasn't accustomed to youth using such words.  I took a look at this small crowd.  There were seven of them (four women and three men), excluding James and me, and they all seemed to be about my age.  It was as if a boat from 1920s Hollywood had dropped a group of young stars and starlets off on this dock.  One girl bore a resemblance to Lillian Gish.  One of the guys looked like Ivor Novello.  The others brought famous faces to mind too.  Of course, they weren't these stars, but they would have fit into the old silent films just fine.          James asked, "Hey Howard, did you bring the drinks?"  Howard was a tall kid, probably six feet tall.  He had very dark, slicked-back hair.  He smiled and said, "Of course, it's on the boat."  He pointed behind him.  There was a white sailboat there, probably twenty-five feet long.  He then directed a question towards James and me, "Why are you two so dressed up?"  I looked at James.  James laughed and responded, "Oh, I thought we were all going out to dinner."  The group laughed as if to say, "Who needs to eat when we can get drunk?"  James started cracking up too, obviously a little embarrassed.          They all filed onto the boat.  I was the last one on.  Then we set off. Everybody was talking and passing around a bottle of whiskey, me included.  I was saying things that I wasn't thinking.  Clearly, I had no control.  After a couple of swigs, I had to stop.  The whiskey was making me ill.  I walked over and sat down at the front of the boat.  Facing the group, I continued conversing with them.          Two or three hours passed.  We were now in the center of the lake, and the sun was down.  James was carrying on like a fool.  The fact that they were passing vodka around now too didn't help matters.  I was still sitting at the front of the boat.  James came up to me.  He had a cigarette in his mouth.  He took it out and threw it into the water.  Then he walked over to the railing and climbed onto it.  He was yelling nonsensically.  The gang was laughing at him.  They were drunk too, of course.  I was the only one who seemed concerned.  "James," I said, "get off the railing."  It was as if I said nothing.  I didn't want to get up.  I thought that the slightest movement could send him into the water.  He was out of my reach.  I repeated, but this time louder and with more conviction, "James, get off the railing!  Come on, get off the railing!"  Then he jumped, and everyone rushed to look.  He was underwater, and he wasn't coming up.  I wasted no time jumping in after him.  Something told me I could save him.         The water was cold, and I sunk into it just like he had.  I struggled, and at the same time, looked for my drowning friend.  Where was he?  Clearly, he was sinking somewhere beneath my feet.  I managed to slip my shoes off, which made things a little easier.  I moved my arms and legs furiously to stay afloat, and then I dove.  I couldn't see; it was too dark now.  I felt for a body, but I grabbed nothing but handfuls of cold water.  I had to go up for air.  I returned to the surface and I yelled.  I heard the cries and yells coming from the sailboat.  I asked them to throw something down so I could stay afloat, and try to find James while they went back for help.  But something told me it was much too late for James.  He was at the bottom of the lake. I knew it. Then I asked them to throw me a line so I could get back on the boat.  But they were moving away now.  They had lifted the anchor, and were headed toward the shore.  The drunk fools.  They had left me here to die.  I could have climbed the anchor line, but they were too wasted to think logically.         The only way for me to stay above water was to move my arms and legs, and I did.  After ten minutes, I was out of energy.  They had only just reached the shore.  The water was so cold now.  I cried.  The tears ran down my face like they never had before.  I didn't want to die.  I should've tried to jump for James before he went into the water.  So many thoughts went through my mind.  Then I sank.  I remember that sickening feeling I felt as I struggled.  I looked toward the surface, as it faded away ever so gradually.  It was a sense of helplessness which can't be explained.         Then it was over... but before I opened my eyes, a scene entered my mind.  There was a shaded hill with grave markers on it, a part of a cemetery.  There were two large oak trees on that hill that really stuck out in my mind. If I saw those trees again, I'd recognize them instantly.            I woke up, and here I was now.  I was about to go somewhere, but I didn't know exactly where. I got into my car and drove far, probably fifty miles.  There was a map in my head guiding me, but I couldn't see it.  I finally came to a town called Winsington.  I had never been here before.  I had never driven through it.  As I neared the downtown area, I saw a sign.  It had an arrow pointing right and the words "Winsington Lake" on it.  I turned right.  I kept driving until I reached the lake.  This was the lake I had dreamt about.  No, it couldn't be.  It was just a coincidence.  The docks weren't the same.  They weren't where they had been in my dream.  Then I thought about those people.  They weren't modern people.  They looked like individuals from eighty years back.     I got out of my car and went into the visitors building where it appeared individuals could rent boats to take out on the lake.  I don't know why I went in.  I didn't know why I was doing a lot of things.  The room I walked into wasn't very big, so I noticed the photos on the wall right away.  I walked over to them.  There were several pictures.  There appeared to be one photo from each decade of the past century.  I worked my way down from the 1990s. Then I saw it.  That's what I had seen in my dream!  It looked exactly the same.  It was taken in 1935.  Then I saw the 1925 picture, and it looked like what I had seen in my dream as well.  I wanted to tell myself it was a coincidence, but deep down I knew there was something to this.      A thought came into my head, but I figured I shouldn't do what it suggested.  Then it crossed my mind again.  Should I go to that old man at the desk and ask him if anyone ever drowned here?  It seemed a bit grim, but I figured I had nothing to lose.  I had come all this way.  I should just put this thing to rest.  I approached him.  "Good afternoon, sir," I said.  "Good afternoon," he replied, "may I help you with something?"  "Yes," I said, "I know this is a bit of an odd question, but has anyone ever drowned in this lake?"  He looked at me, obviously surprised.  "Funny you should ask," the old man said, "If my memory serves me correctly, it's been eighty years this week since the only two drownings on record occurred here.  I was a kid then, but I remember it.  It was a big deal in this town.  Two teenagers drowned.  One jumped off the sailboat they were on, and then the other tried to save him. Everyone who was on that boat is dead now I think.  From what I heard, they all went to their graves with much guilt hanging over them.  The kid who tried to save the other one, his death could have been prevented.  He was still above the water, but his friends headed back to shore, leaving him to die.  They initially blamed it on the booze they drank that night, but they later blamed themselves.  I don't believe any of them ever accepted it.  It's a sad story."  I stood there shocked.  I was incredulous.  I thanked him, turned around, and headed out the door.  I took one more look at the lake, and then got into my car.  I didn't like the feeling I was getting there.    I decided that I would try and find the town's cemetery.  That had to be where those two were buried.  I drove around for roughly a half an hour until I finally found it.  It was nestled in the woods, on the outskirts of the town.  It wasn't a big cemetery at all.  It was hilly though.  I drove up and down the hills, looking for those elm trees.  Then I saw them.  I parked the car and got out.  I ran over to that hill and walked up it, examining each stone.  For twenty minutes I looked and looked.  Suddenly, I saw a stone with the name James on it.  "James Edward Turner" it read.  The date of birth was June 16, 1905.  The date of death was July 28, 1924.  It was him, no doubt in my mind.  I stood there for a minute and took it all in.  Then I continued searching for the other one, the one I had been.  A few minutes later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.  The stone read "Henry Gerald Thomas."  Unbelievable.  Absolutely unbelievable.  The feeling that came over me at that minute can't be put into words.  I looked at the dates of birth and death "May 28, 1905 - July 28, 1924."     I sat down on the grave for a few minutes, and closed my eyes.  I saw nothing in my mind.  There was nothing for me to say.  I stood up and left.
