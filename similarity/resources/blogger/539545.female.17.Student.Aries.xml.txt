hey, it's a me, tomario.  just got back from michigan today (monday, for all you people wondering when the f*** i wrote this).  and i came up for a new name while i was gone - jeepers creepers and the ADD kids. (i'm assuming mike thurston would like to be included in the band name somehow, and unless he wants to get an operation, ADD girls just doesn't fit him in somehow.)  beth i know you will like this one.  or it could just be jeepers creepers - but anyway, coolest band name ever.    so who's still gone again?

i'm not home anymore. i'm not sure when i'm coming back tho! (uhm... before school starts. that's fosho)  letsee... i dont know. if you want to, stacey and beth could talk while we're gone. or you guys could just wait cuz we'll be back within a month (i hope) alright, well i'll be checking here for any news. take care guys ^^

aww helen! well saturday evening u say? i don't know...cause i will be leaving for southern illinois university tonight at 3am...and i'm visiting all through friday, and i don't know how long it will take. i know it's about an 8 hour drive....so i don't know if i'll get back in time on saturday to have a morning practice.....maybe afternoon, but that might b cutting it close for u.....well, we'll hafta figure that one out soon.....how about the rest of u? how does saturday look for u guyz?!

Hey guys~ i'm just telling you all, i'm gonna be gone for about a week starting saturday evening or sunday sometimes.... so i was thinking, maybe we should have a meeting on saturday. i think that'd workout the best for me. but if some other day works out better for you guys, you should go ahead and plan (dont let just one person hinder our band.. i mean one person can always catch up.. no?) alright well i'll hope to be hearing from you  soon ^^ take care guys

they do not all suck! personally i like blanket expression.....oooh, this is stacey for those of u who don't know. but um...yea, i vote blanket expression!!!

Tom hates all these band names, even though he contributed some.  He thinks we should be called "Blood-Sucking Demons from Mars."  Or just "Blood-Sucking Demons."  Or even just "The Blood Suckers".  Basically, we've gotta have a name that makes somebody puke.  Actually, these band names don't suck, they're just not awesome enough.  And there's too many of them.  Hey, we could call ourselves the blood-sucking martians.  Wait, what am I talking about?  Oh, must be that ADD kicking in.   Okay, my real idea was "Kariya," named after Paul Kariya, the Colorado Avalanche's left wing.  I think that name would be cool, and we could get hockey jerseys with his name on it, which would exponentially increase the awesomeness of this band. Drugs! Drugs! Drugs! Don't worry, I'm not on them.....right now!  HE HE HE HE! Oh yeah, tell me what you think.

so since everyone is back, i think it's a good idea to have another rehearsal before the new school year starts. so when would b a good time for u guyz? i pretty free for the rest of august. pretty free during the week i mean. so just inform me and everyone else wut ur plans are...and then we'll plan a suitable date for the next rehearsal.   is it still uncertain if mike can meet? just wondering....he's serious about the band right?   oh, and next meeting we should decide on a name. keep thinking of ideas!  -peace-
