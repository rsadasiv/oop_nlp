I'm making pork barbecue.  It's not quite as good as when you buy it, but I got a hankerin' after watching the BBQ special on the Travel Channel, and well, I just had to have some.  I swear, I watched that show and drooled for a solid half hour!   I have a lot of pet peeves.  They're almost a sort of amusement for me and my friends, and to be honest there ARE a lot of things that piss me off, but I think I need to prioritize them a bit by documenting them in this diary.  Since I have nothing else going on right now, I think I'll give the cartoon pig an apron and let him gleefully cook himself, and get started.  Here goes:    ROB'S PET PEEVES (in no particular order) - INSTALLMENT ONE    1. People who walk too slowly.  Worse than that are the "defensive linemen" - those are the ones who zigzag in order to prevent your passing.  Next time someone does that I'm gonna clock him.  LOL.   2. Anyone who is famous for no good reason.  "Good reasons" include: singing/songwriting talent, EXTREME good looks, acting ability.  "NOT good reasons" include but are not limited to: promiscuity with famous people, being a sibling of another famous person, former child stardom, drug use, general abrasive demeanor, etc., etc..   3. Animatronic things.  Well really, anything that could come alive in a horror movie and kill you.  4. Sleeveless t-shirts or anything from the "Abercrombie Muscle" line.   5. Blatant mispronunciations of common words, like "supposably", "nucular" or "aluminium" (for all you British folks out there)   6. Adding the letter   S   to words it doesn't belong in.  Usually a business name, e.g. "Nordstroms", "Krystals".  Conversely, subtracting   S  's from words it does belong in, although less common, annoys me too.   7. Calling something a bean that is not.  Green beans, wax beans and soybeans are   not   beans, despite what you may have heard!   8. Gratuitous, uninvited touching of any kind.  Most commonly found in gay bars (ass grabbing, back grazing) but also includes any kind of pinching, slapping or Indian rug burn.  Worst on the face but unwelcome in all forms.   9. Blatant overuse of air conditioning.  Most common in Sunbelt states such as Florida, Arizona and Texas but prevalent throughout the country.   10. People who set clocks fast so that they will "have more time to wake up in the morning".  That's NOT what you're doing, twit, you're setting your alarm earlier.  Quit confusing me with your inaccurate clocks.   11. Anyone who is, or uses the terms "pop princess" or "diva" in everyday conversation.   12. People who invoke the opinion of Jesus to win an argument.  Similarly, people who believe their faith is proven fact.  Read your Bible and hush.  13. People who allow their children to run around a restaurant.  Not the   kids  ...the   parents!     14. Deliberately misspelled words.  Especially prevalent in business signs.  Examples: Kwik, E-Z, Xtreme, Xterra (unfortunate, since I own one)   Double peeve points for gay-oriented misspellings!   15. Conservatives who invoke the "good old days" when milkshakes were 10 cents and people respected their elders.  Nostalgia is way overrated.  Just remember, in the idyllic storytime 1950s...  - A woman's place was in the kitchen, under her husband with her legs in the air, and in the maternity ward  - Blacks were consciously relegated to the fringes of society  - Homosexuality was seen as a mental illness  - Cigarettes were marketed as safe products on television by doctors paid handsomely by tobacco companies  - The world legitimately feared global nuclear holocaust   (Yeah, let's go back THERE...)     I'll end on a lighter note (since that's where I intended to keep these in the first place!):   16. Anytime my hands smell like a foreign substance.  This especially includes cocoa butter lotion, mayonnaise, dust and maple syrup.   That pork BBQ was pretty good but I burned the hell out of the outside.  Oh well, charcoal's good for you, right? :)

Denise has been open for only 4 days and already I feel like I've abandoned her.  Left her on the side of the road like a dirty pair of panties.  I have a weird guilt in not writing even though I really never committed to doing it in the first place.  I'm starting to really like this "Dave 93" radio station.  I can't figure out the symbology of the name, but it's oddly intriguing.  I wonder if this will start a trend...if so, I want my station to be 102.5 "The Raawwwb!".  I will only play songs from my MP3 list and no one will listen because my taste is too diverse.  Or maybe EVERYONE will listen because I am just that cool!  Who knows?  I really need to just get up off my lazy ass and finish unpacking today.  I can't believe I've lived in a house for 6 weeks and there are still boxes sitting open all over the place.  It's not even really unpacking, it's just crap I haven't thrown in the attic yet...I'll never use any of it.  That's just sad!  ODE TO A SUICIDE SLUG  O little slug, You crawl up from the drain And slither up to my contact lens case. There you cuddle as though it were Your slug lover.  Then you dry out and I am left with something that looks like a  Wood Chip.  Why do you do this?  O suicide slug? Don't you know I have enough to clean without slug cadavers? I find this behavior quite assy.  At least the roaches didn't crawl on my  Toiletries before they died legs in the air like a dog wanting a tummy rub.  And the spiders, too, have the courtesy To only ambush me Outside the house.

Honestly, that's how tired I am.  I went out last night with Jamie, and while I know better (I'm not 22 anymore!) I stayed out till almost 1 in the morning, and I've been paying for it all day.   Anyway, this is my first "blog" entry...although I hate that non-word.  I'm going to call mine a diary.  And I'll name my diary Denise.  Because Denise will listen to you bitch, and she will never give crappy advice that will get you in trouble.  I don't expect this to be terribly interesting, but I thought what the hell.  I'm weird...and some people actually like that.  So why not?   So they changed my favorite radio station today.  Why is it that when they change a radio station, it's always some fly-by-night sketchy deal that no one knows about until it's happened?  In this case, they didn't even wait until night...they were brazen enough to do it some time in mid-day, because it was Z93 when I went to work this morning, and when I come home it's Dave 93 or something betarded like that.  WTF????  Oh well, it seems a decent station so far, in spite of the stupid name and hostile takeover tactics.  Doesn't take much to be "decent" in this town...just look at the competition.  Although I have to take that back, I think they're playing secondhand CDs...one song just screwed up so bad you'd think a cat got hold of the thing.   I'm sitting my friend Victoria's dog Ernie for a few weeks.  I have to admit, at first I was only doing it as a favor, but in just a few days I have totally become attached to this little rag mop.  He follows me all around the house, and he makes cute (albeit weird) little quacking noises when he misses me or is upset.  He seems to be really attached to me already.  And unlike my dog Chandler, when Ernie sits on my foot, he doesn't hurt me with his lard ass.  (Although he does have a lard ass, for such a small dog...LOL)  It's funny to watch them interact...Chandler's about 10 times his size, but he just has this aloof pseudo-curiosity with Ernie, which very quickly turns to desperation whenever I pay him any attention at ALL.  They're both so goofy, it makes me laugh.  Ha ha ha!   I am   SO   looking forward to this weekend.  I can't believe I have two more days of work left.  Three if you count the number of hours I'll be working... bleccchhh!!!  I really don't make enough for the stress and time I spend there, I swear.  Maybe I'll call that headhunter back after all!  But back to this weekend - I really don't want to have any plans.  That's why I never get anything done...I don't really have time to do errands during the week, and by the time I get to the weekend, I'm so tired of working I just want (and deserve, I think!) to goof off as long as I can.   Last thought for the evening (since it's already 10:30, my god!) - I think the spiders are trying to take over the house.  They congregate in the holly tree which hangs over my front gate, and build gargantuan webs which I have to walk through at LEAST twice a day.  As if my spider paranoia wasn't bad enough as it is.  And these spiders are freakin' monstrous...like a whole inch across.  It's rare I don't feel them crawling on me when I walk past the tree.  *shudder*   And on that note, it's sleepy time for Rob!   Hope I don't dream about my eight legged friends!!!
