My oldest son tortured my youngest boy right out of the house.  So we had a little chat about that.  Seems we're feeling we need to do something about it.  Finally.    But anyway, it's peaceful now.  Almost boring.  If the weather was dryer we could go hiking or to the beach or something but we can't even do that.  It's going to be a long day.  Wish we had two tv's.     I decided we're going to stay one more year here.  Move next June/July.   I want to save some money, and buy my boys  some things.   I'm going to start a small brochure web design service for my area businesses.  Lot's of businesses.   Pray for me.  haha..      

We almost made it.  My oldest son, has O.D.D. (oppositional defiance) and my youngest just could not take any more.   Neither can I.   Which is a shame because he WANTED to stay home with his brother this weekend, but his brother will not leave him alone.   My youngest is leaving with his father shortly to give everyone a break.   The oldest will be here alone with me for the next few days.  Which is maybe a good thing for us.     My ex just told me that he and his sister were the very same way.   I don't care.  Enough is enough.  I have said  "SHUT UP"  100 times today I am sure.   It's a terrible thing to say to a kid - but GEEZUS   "Be Quiet"   just wasn't cutting it and I am really losing my patience.   These kids are draining me.   It's summer.   I am not doing this again if I can help it.  He's fine when it's just he and I,  both of them, but put them together and it's HELL ON EARTH.    piss and moan over.   

This humidity, cloudy depressing shit weather is getting on my nerves.   I can't even dry laundry.  These clothes will mildew before they will dry.   okay rant over.    Kids are doing okay.  Have to separate them once in a while but given the MICROSCOPIC size of our home I think that's pretty good for two brothers.     My sister called me yesterday and said to me after I told her I had the boys and one of their friends over,  "Well I was going to invite Dale to the beach with us but I kinda figured his brother was there so I wasn't sure..."    I said   "let me call you back"     :      I didn't know how to respond to that..   So she calls me back and I said  "Yeah he wants to stay here with his brother"   she says  "okay talk to you later."    click.     Is it me...   

if you even want to call it that.  He was okay.  Met him at the beach today.   A loner like me, but I dunno...  cute.    Anyway, it's day 2 for my oldest boys visit.  He's here while my parents vacation.  He could have gone but didn't want to.  So he's here with us and everything has been not too bad overall THANK GAWD.  I think I will order them a pizza later if they can keep from bickering with each other.  It is supposed to rain all weekend so I am praying I don't lose my mind.  haha...  Took my youngest and his friend to the beach for the afternoon.  They had such a great time.  Very happy kids.  And he whined incessantly all morning about how he did NOT want to go.  Geezus.  That's annoying.  But I told him, if he ever wanted to see another video game again he was to play outside during the summer.  So he figured he'd better straighten up I think.  I took it all away one summer... so they know I will do it.     The people who live across from me, had a bunch of guys in their yard fighting and cursing so loud that my son could hear them over his nintendo.  I'd say they were 100 feet away.  Anyway, it got so bad I called the landlord and asked him what to do, he says call the cops.  I decided not to because I listened some more and realized that it was a father-son thing and that everything was fine, but do I really want my 7 yr old seeing and hearing that crap???  The cops came anyway because someone called them from a cell phone.  They came to my door :  I said wrong house.  Now the neighbours think *I* am some sort of snitch.  I dont care.  Not something I even want to be associated with though...  Very humid day today.  Disgusting actually but a good one overall.  :)      

My oldest kid, whose bike was taken from him for TRADING the parts on it after being specifically TOLD not to...  was given it back.  He apparently shadowed my brother and father around for " a few days" at lord knows how much an hour.  Probably more than I  make per hour, or some bizarre thing.   Anyhoo - he calls me at 10 pm to tell me this.  And so I praise him etc..  But I'm still going to have a little chat with him next time I see him about it all.  I don't think they made him work hard enough for it.   In  MY opinion  anyway.  But I'm not allowed to say anything or I'm seen as ungrateful :   I've been "ungrateful"  alot.     And it was a good day today for my youngest which  really makes me happy .  He went to work with his father.  He was tickled pink over it.  Came home happy but admitted he had no playmates.  What can you really do in a mill anyway for entertainment for your kid?  The girl who works there took him for ice cream.  I think he just wanted to see his Dad.  Which made me happy because two months ago that wasn't the case and it made my life with respect to his father a living hell.  Thankfully somehow we turned things around.  I think the kid just wanted a break from  something  and I gave it to him.  I know how chaotic steplife is.  Even if it's only four days a month.  When you're a kid, and you're not happy somewhere, a weekend seems like forever.     Went for a good bike ride today.  I am not sure how many km but it was 45 minutes each way and it was like driving over moguls 2/3 of the way.  Good thing I like them.   I'm taking my youngest down the trail tomorrow, and then down another by foot he's been dying to go on.  You can't take a bike on some of them. We couldn't do it before because I never bothered with a bike lock and didn't know these trails even existed.  So anyway, bike lock delivered means we go on a new adventure, with lunch even ;)   The simple things that thrill kids eh?  The oldest threatened to join us.  I said YEAH come with us.  I think maybe we'll just leave WITH him and he can accompany us for lunch or not.  We'll be going in the same direction.  He said he just wanted to stay a minute and see his brother.  Who knows.  Maybe he'll bring a friend.  Sometimes he says that and he stays for a week.  But I can see why he would want to keep cruising with such a beautiful bike.   So help me if he abuses it or acts up again though.       Gotta go, my youngest didn't end up getting fed his dinner so I have to do it at 10:45 PM.  Does that impress me?  I think I will just ignore it for now.   Chow.    

I'm just going to kvetch pure speculation all over your nice new shirt :D  But I think my oldest son may move home soon.  It might be just wishful thinking because he's been mad at me for 2+ years non-stop for what - NO ONE KNOWS ...  but anyway.  I'm sure I screwed up enough.  I digress.  He's been here more this week than he's been here since last September.  It seems like my mother sent him here. I asked what it was about when she called to tell me and she says "because I told him he was going"..  so what do I take from that.  I don't know if it's because he lost his year and they are frustrated and have probably had it "up to here" with him.  I feel so bad sometimes.  It would be a relief to have him back home.  Besides, he's over indulged and underdisciplined.  He's needs his arse kicked.    So anyway, he's behind me in our friggin MICROHOME watching the Simpsons happily and without alot of ruckus today.  His brother is at my sisters for a visit for the day.  Had a job interview today that cost me 60$ in taxi fare and 45 minutes of my time.  Geezus.  That frosts me.    So how was your day?  #:|

    yep, it's me..  

With this thing.  I'm 35 years old with maybe too much "life experience" so this blog may prove to be an interesting read..  You'll have to excuse me if I switch gears suddenly in my writing because it's just the way I think.  Don't worry, I usually go back to my previous thought(s) at some point.    My compliments to the developers on the blogger.com project.  Nice work.  Interesting.  Geez now I have to go looking all through this again just for fun..  Later.
