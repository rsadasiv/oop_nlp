It has been a month since 45-year-old Fatima Khan (name changed) is admitted in GT Hospital's psychiatry ward for schizophrenia. Doctors say she has had 75% recovery but her relatives have not bothered to check on her forcing the hospital to keep her in the ward and bear her expenses. The hospital has written to the UAE embassy to tell her husband to take her home.
Dr Sagar Mundada, a resident doctor at GT Hospital, said, "Khan had come for sonography tests along with her 12-year-old daughter. She was quite violent.
Dr Yusuf Matcheswala, who is our head of department, decided to admit her."
Dr Mundada said that while the girl had sketchy details about their address, Fatima was in a state of acute schizophrenia and hence couldn't help them. "We started the treatment without waiting for her relatives. Within a few days, she was better. We got in touch with her son and father. Both refused to take her responsibility because of the nature of her disease. We have tried getting in touch with her husband who works in UAE. We have also written to the UAE embassy," said Dr Mundada.
Four more patients are getting treated for mental illness by GT Hospital doctors without any relatives being next to them.
He said that treating a patient with mental illness without a relative is a common thing at GT Hospital. "We see 3-4 such patients who are dumped by their family. Police and we become their custodians. We hope that they get treated and tell us details," said Dr Mundada.
The department has 30 beds, out of which 20 are for male patients and 10 are for female. "In six months of my career with GT Hospital, there has not been a single day when the number of admitted patients in the ward has dropped below 25. We have to put extra beds on the floor sometime," said Dr Mundada. The department has two resident doctors, one lecturer, 14 nursing staff and three ward boys.
Dr Yusuf Matcheswala said, "We do not turn away any patient even if there is no relative with them. Since it is a government hospital, practically everything is free. The little things that is otherwise needed, we doctors manage."
