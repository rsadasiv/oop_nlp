Leaving her native land in Kabul, Shazia Ansari (name changed) came to India with her family in 2012. " The enemies tried to kill us. They tried to burn me alive in Afghanistan," she exclaimed. The family was forced to flee from their country because of a threat to their security. "Being a female, I was not allowed to work in Kabul. My husband used to work at construction sites," she said.
After coming to India, the family contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and got themselves documented as Afghan refugees. Initially, the family ran a small burger business to sustain themselves but it was later shut down as Ansari's husband was detected with a mental illness. Ansari said, "I get financial aid from UNHCR and I am involved in a project with Enactus Kirorimal College (KMC). They (KMC) have helped me a lot in being financially independent." Enactus KMC runs Project Patradya, which aims to empower Afghan refugees by providing them an alternate source of income. It is an attempt towards a plastic-free world through edible cutlery made by Afghan women refugees.
Living in the neighborhood of South Delhi, she spoke of her present condition. She said, "My husband and three kids are ill. I have to face a lot of problems. The only support I get is from UNHCR and Enactus KMC." She further alleged that someone from Afghanistan knocks at her door at night. "I have asked for help from UNHCR and I hope they will support me like they have done for past many years."Â 
Beating the odds, Ansari and her family have come a long way yearning for a better life at a 'home away from home'. Nobel Peace Laureate Elie Wiesel once said, "Today, as yesterday, a nation is judged by its attitude towards refugees."
