In what could help the government to ponder and tweak its policies to look after the needs of differently abled persons, the latest findings of Census data 2001-2011 show that over 8.3% or as many as 2.08 crore households in India have differently abled persons.
In terms of population, India has more than 2.68 crore disabled persons of which 1.5 crore are male and 1.18 crore female.
The data released by the Census Commissioner of India on Tuesday shows that the number of total households having disabled persons has shown an increase of 20.5 lakhs -- from 187.3 lakhs in 2001 to 207.8 lakhs in 2011. Of these, 6.2 lakhs are in rural and 14.3 lakhs in urban areas.
Out of the total households having disabled persons, about 99 per cent homes are normal homes, 0.4 per cent are institutional and 0.2 per cent are house-less households. 'House less households' are those households who do not live in buildings or census houses but live in the open on roadside, pavements etc.
The data gives exhaustive detail state-wise of seven types of disabilities -- hearing, seeing, speech, movement, mental retardation, mental illness and multiple disability in terms of households and gender thus serving as a ready handbook for the government to roll out schemes tailor made to target each section.
Between 2001-11, the differently abled increased by 48, 19,382 in normal households, by 65,895 in institutional households and by 22,948 in house-less households, the data said.
Meanwhile, normal households increased by 2,02,4495, institutional households by 8,370 and house-less households by 13,560 during the time, it added.
According to the Census of India, a group of unrelated persons who live in an institution and take their meals from a common kitchen is called an institutional household.
