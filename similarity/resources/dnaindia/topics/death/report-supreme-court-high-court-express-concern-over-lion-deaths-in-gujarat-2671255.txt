The Supreme Court as well as the Gujarat High Court on Wednesday expressed displeasure and concern over the death of 23 Asiatic lions in Gir Forest National Park in past three weeks. While the Supreme Court ordered the Centre to immediately look into the matter to save the lion population, the Gujarat High Court has ordered the state government to come up with details on how it intends to tackle the three major causes of lion deaths--electrocution, open-wells, and deaths due to the spread of virus.
"Today, we are facing a peculiar problem. Lions are dying. There seems to be some kind of virus. We do not know. It is coming in newspapers. You find it out," a bench headed by justice Madan B Lokur instructed additional solicitor general ANS Nadkarni. The remark was made during the hearing of a petition related to the re-introduction of cheetahs in India from Namibia in Africa.
Meanwhile, the high court's division bench of chief justice R Subhash Reddy and justice VM Pancholi remarked: "We are reading about lion deaths everyday in the newspapers. What is the government doing?" The bench during the hearing of a suo-motu petition over lion deaths categorically instructed the state to come with a concrete plan to tackle lion deaths and place it before the court on October 8. The chief justice also remarked that apart from the virus problem, two other major cause of lion deaths are electrocution from electric fence and open-wells without a parapet wall. The court also clarified that the steps to be proposed by the government to curb lion deaths should have a definite time-frame.
Additional advocate general Prakash Jani apprised the high court about the steps already taken by the government. It included formation of 140 teams to monitor the movement of 600 lions spread over an area of 3,000 sq km in Dalkhaniya Range of Amreli district and shifting of 31 lions from Semerdi to Jamvala Rescue Center. The government has also engaged 3 experts from Indian Veterinary Research Center, five from Delhi Zoo, and two from Lion Safari Etawah, apart from importing vaccines from US as a precautionary measure.
