The Delhi government has order a magisterial inquiry after three minor sisters died due to 'starvation' on Tuesday.
The girls — aged two, four and years were found unconscious in their one-room house by their neighbours in Mandawali area of east Delhi. They were rushed to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, however, they were declared brought dead.
According to family members, the two sisters were vomiting due to diarrhoea. 
The girls family had moved to Mandawali a few days back and they were living with a relative after earlier landlord removed them from the house due to lack of money.
Their father, Mangal, is a rickshaw-puller, but some people had reportedly taken away his rickshaw a few days ago, and since then there was no work for him. The family is financially weak.
However, Mangal, who went out in search of work has not returned yet, whereas, the minors mother is mentally challenged.
While the police claimed that the case was still being investigated and that the cause of death was not yet known, the doctor of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital said that during the post-mortem, the children's stomachs were empty.
"It seems that the children have not eaten anything since eight days."
The police, however, have ruled out any foul play as no injury marks were found on their bodies, a police officer said. 
It seemed to be a case of natural death, he said, adding that the bodies were sent for postmortem and an inquiry ordered in the case.
