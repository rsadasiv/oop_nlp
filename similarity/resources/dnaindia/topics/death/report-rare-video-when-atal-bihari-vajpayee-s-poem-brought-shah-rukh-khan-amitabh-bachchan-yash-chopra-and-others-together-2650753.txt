Former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee isn't just remembered as a political leader, but also as a powerful orator and a poet. He left everyone as impressed with his poetry as with his  impactful speeches. His poetry collection is pretty huge. Did you know that one of his poems brought together stalwarts like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Yash Chopra, Jagjit Singh and Javed Akhtar? 
Well, turns out that after becoming the Prime Minister of the country, it wasn't possible for him to attend poetry meets and functions, so he would include a few lines from his poems in his speeched in the parliament. One of his poems was also included in a music album by noted ghazal singer Jagjit Singh. 
Jagjit Singh's 2002 album Samvedna included the poem Kya Khoya Kya Paaya, which was written by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It was crooned by Jagjit Singh himself and it's music video, which featured Shah Rukh Khan, was directed by none other than Yash Chopra. 
What comes as an added treat is the fact that the first few verses of the song have been voiced by Amitabh Bachchan. These additional verses were written by acclaimed lyricist Javed Akhtar. 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee left for heavenly abode after prolonged illness on August 16, 2018. He breathed his last at AIIMS around 05:05 pm on Thursday. 
Vajpayee became the PM in 1996 for a few days and then later on he went on to occupy the post from 1998 to 2004.
