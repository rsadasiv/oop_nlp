Even after the repeated appeals by the government and supporters of Maratha quota agitation, the incidents of suicides to support the agitation are not stopping. This time in Pune district, a 34-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train in Purandar tehsil of the district today.
A body of Dattatraya Tukaram Shinde (34) was found on railway tracks near Daudaj. Shinde was a resident of Pingori village in Purandar tehsil. Police have found a note from his residence which has a mention of Maratha reservation.
Superintendent of police (Pune rural) Sandeep Patil said, "Police have though found a note from his residence which mentions that he was threatening to commit suicide if the reservation was not given by August 5. However, in that note, he had stated that he would end his life by jumping into a river. Now we are still investigating if it is the case of suicide or if it was an accident."
Shinde was working as a driver at a private tour operator in Shirur taluka. His death came to light when a station master of Daundraj railway station informed the Jejuri police station about his body lying on railway tracks at around 6 am today. 
Meanwhile, Pune city police today detained nine persons who had threatened to commit suicide in support of ongoing Maratha quota stir on Friday.
Inspector Satish Mane, in charge of Wakad police station, said, "Total nine persons have been taken into detention today. They are the members of Sambhaji brigade and Chhava sanghatana."
These men had given an ultimatum to the government to accept their demands related to ongoing Maratha agitation or they had threatened to commit suicide by jumping from district collectorate building on Saturday.
"They were demanding immediate monetary compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the kin of Kakasaheb Patil. They had also demanded to register a case of culpable homicide against the chief minister and given the deadline till today. Based on their threats of committing suicide, we detained them," Mane said.
In another incident, some altercation was witnessed between the members of Maratha community and family members of BJP's Member of Legislative Assembly Medha Kulkarni. As a part of the agitation, the Maratha organisations members have been holding dharna outside the residences of elected representatives and today they were holding dharna outside Kulkarni's residence in Kothrud. 
On Thursday, a day before the agitation, there were some media reports about Kulkarni calling the dharna agitation of Maratha community a stunt. The Maratha organisations took objection to Kulkarni's alleged statement and they demonstrated outside her house. The protesters also alleged that while they were holding dharna, Kulkarni's son came to the terrace of the house and used abusive language. 
Kulkarni however has denied all the allegations. She said, "It is absolutely wrong that I am ridiculing the agitation or I am against it. In fact, during the massive rally which was taken out in support of Maratha reservation in Pune last year, I also had participated in it."
"It is unfortunate that my family is being dragged into the issue without any reason. There were some persons who used abusive language against me and my family. I was not at home and when some protesters called me, I invited them at my office for discussion. It hurt me when I was being called as casteist," she said.
