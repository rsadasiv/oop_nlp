A 22-year-old man from Manipur was bludgeoned to death by his cousin as he had withdrawn some amount from his account without his permission. The incident was reported from South-East Delhi’s Sunlight Colony area.
According to the police, a call was received at 5:30 am from the Bhagwan Nagar area. The deceased identified as Suihaimi Khangah lived with his brother AS Shunreiwung and cousin Lei Shingham. On Thursday morning, Lei and Suihaimi had an argument as the latter had withdrawn some money from his account and had not told him. He kept on hitting him until he collapsed on the ground. The police were informed and he was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.
According to their friends who were present when the incident occurred, Lei asked Suihaimi to return his money. Suihaimi had withdrawn around Rs 17,000 from Lei’s account after he got to know his password. But Suihaimi did not inform him about the withdrawal. Later Lei went to his house and got an iron rod with which he hit him. A case of murder has been registered.
“Lei repeatedly hit him with a blunt object after which he collapsed on the ground. The deceased and his brother have been living in Delhi for the past 3-4 years. Lei Shingham was staying with deceased for the past one-and-a-half year. The present accommodation was hired about 5-6 months ago. Before this, they resided at Gandhi Vihar near Mukherjee Nagar. Efforts are being made to nab Lei,” said a senior police official.
