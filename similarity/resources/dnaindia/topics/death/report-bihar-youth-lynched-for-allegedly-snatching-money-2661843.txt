In yet another incident of mobocracy, a man was beaten to death in Bihar's Sitamari district on Sunday 
The victim has been identified as Rupesh. He was thrashed by the crowd after a van driver said that the man had snatched money from him.
Bihar police have registered an FIR against 150 people in the case.
The victim was first taken to the Sadar hospital and then shifted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.
Asked whether the 'snatched' money was found, Deputy SP Veer Dhirendra said the case was being investigated from all angles.
“What kind of law is it to beat someone to death just because you think he is criminal? People are being killed on roads now, people are losing faith in judiciary,” said the victim’s kin.
On Monday, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said those involved in incidents of hate and lynching cannot call themselves nationalists while holding that legislation alone was not enough as a change in societal behaviour was required to prevent such cases.
The vice president also expressed anguish over the politicisation of incidents of lynching, saying such cases should not be linked with political parties.
"Societal change (is needed). This (lynching) is not because of this party or that party. The moment you attribute it to these parties, the cause is lost. That is what is happening, let me be very frank," he said.
