It has been only a month since popular TV actors Rubina Dilaik and Abhinav Shukla tied the knot. The two got married in a fairytale wedding ceremony in Shimla on June 21, and since then have resumed working on their respective projects. 
Rubina plays the lead in Colors' show Shakti Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, while Abhinav essays a negative role in the show Silsila Badalte Rishton Ka. In a recent interview with Hindustan Times, speaking about their marriage, Rubina said, "It has just not sunk in, because immediately after we got back from our wedding, we went for our shoots. We hardly get to see each other after pack up because our schedules are pretty erratic and they really don't coincide with each other's time." She further told the daily, "But we are enjoying this also, because it's kind of exciting when you manage your personal and professional life and the balance you strike." The actress also went on to say that the "newness is interesting and exciting and it has a lot of longing."
Rubina intently waits for the pack up so that she can meet her better-half soon even if that is for an hour. And how does she make up for the lost time? "If I have some time, like 15-20 minutes, I bake something for Abhinav. I love to cook for him. So, we both just steal time for each other," she told the newspaper.
The honeymoon plans for the couple will have to wait for some more time, courtesy, their work commitments. 
Speaking of which, Rubina told the daily, "Honeymoon plans are yet to be finalised, because we are committed to our work as well. So, it will happen only after a couple of months. I have a few destinations in mind and depending upon the days and offs we get together, we will zero down on a destination."
Rubina Dilaik got her big break in the TV industry with the show Choti Bahu- Sindoor Bin Suhagan. Abhinav Shukla, on the other hand, has featured in shows like Ek Hazaaron Mein Meri Behna Hai, Hitler Didi, Badalte Rishton Ki Dastaan and Diya Aur Baati Hum.
