Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are reportedly set to tie the knot on November 20, in Italy. Buzz is that Ranveer's family is keen on having a typical Sindhi wedding, replete with traditional customs, including Saanth, where friends and relatives tear groom's clothes. 
We had earlier reported that Deepika's mother, Ujala Padukone, is also planning to host a Nandi puja in Bengaluru for the bride and groom, ten days ahead of the wedding. 
The two actors, however, have not confirmed the wedding, yet. They have been cleverly dodging the questions. Recently when asked about the big day, Deepika played safe by saying, "You will know soon." 
Ranveer and Deepika's wedding will be a close-knit affair with only 30 people in attendance. The couple is expected to host grand receptions once they return to the country as man and wife. A source had earlier told DNA AfterHrs that the couple has requested their guests to not carry mobile phones to the wedding venue to avoid getting any pictures leaked.
