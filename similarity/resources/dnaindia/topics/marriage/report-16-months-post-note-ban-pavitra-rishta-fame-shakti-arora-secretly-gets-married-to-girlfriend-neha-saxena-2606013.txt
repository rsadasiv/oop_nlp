Finally! Popular TV actor Shakti Arora, who shot to fame with the daily soap Pavitra Rishta, has tied the knot to her long time girlfriend Neha Saxena in a secret ceremony. The duo was to get married last year itself, but reportedly their marriage got postponed due to the note ban that was imposed in November 2016. 
Shakti shared a picture of the two of them together, post their wedding. The newly wed couple can be seen in colour co-ordinated outfits in maroon and golden colours. Shakti captioned the picture writing, "Together is a wonderful place to be!"
The duo got married on April 6 this year in a private ceremony. Shakti told an entertainment website that they got married in a hush hush ceremony. The Haldi ceremony took place in the morning and the 7 pheras took place in the evening. Only a few close family members were present on the occasion of their wed-lock. 
Shakti and Neha got engaged back in the year 2014. Last year, rumours were rife that their relationship has gone kaput and that they've decided to part ways. Then Shakti had come forward to deny the rumours and called them baseless. 
Together is a wonderful place to be!
