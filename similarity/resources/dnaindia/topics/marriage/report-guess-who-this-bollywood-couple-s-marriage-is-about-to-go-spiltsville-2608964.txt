This Bollywood couple (both good-looking) have been in a troubled marriage for years on end. Earlier, there were tremors in their relationship because a star wife did a cameo in both of their lives (yes, the husband and the wife) causing a major upheaval. More recently, the trouble increased because try as much as they did, they could not get rid of the ghosts of their past.
Now, the sad news is that the couple, both in their 40s, may split up. The only reconciliation is that their decision to part ways is being treated with a lot of maturity. A source says, “They are separating because they cannot get along. However, there is nothing ugly about the split anymore.”
In fact, the most beautiful part about their separation (if splitting can be termed beautiful that is) is that both the parents are committed to the welfare of their children.
And, they will definitely co-parent amicably like many other celebrity couples across the globe, who are all committed to giving their children as much love and care as they can. After all, the kids are innocent victims.
