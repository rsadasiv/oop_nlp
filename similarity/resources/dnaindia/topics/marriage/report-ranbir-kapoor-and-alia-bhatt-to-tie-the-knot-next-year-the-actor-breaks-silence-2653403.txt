Speculations about Ranbir Kapoor's relationship with Alia Bhatt have been rife even before he admitted being in love with her. The actor, who's basking in the glory of the success of his last release, Sanju, has been rumoured to tie the knot with the Raazi actress by next year. 
Now, speaking about his marriage plans with Alia in a recent interview with the Hindustan Times, Ranbir said, "It’s [such rumours] all a part of show business. You make up a story, and soon, there’s another story of the first story, and so on. I have always believed that marriage is something that will happen naturally."
Ranbir was further quoted as saying by the daily, "It can’t be like, ‘Okay, I am 35 now, so it’s time to get married’. It should come to you and your partner naturally and you should both feel, ‘This is the right phase. Now, we should take this relationship to the next level’. But abhi aisi koi baat nai hai. I haven’t decided on marriage yet.”
When quizzed about dating Alia, Ranbir told the daily that he's not playing hide-and-seek and that he's in a happy, positive and beautiful phae of his life. "But you can talk about your personal life only to a degree. Otherwise, it becomes the forerunner of your life and your work takes a back seat. There is always excitement to know about someone’s personal life. But you want to give the relationship respect so that people don’t malign it in a gossipy way. It is something beautiful, sacred and really important to you, so you want to deal with it in a nice manner," he added. 
Meanwhile, on the work front, Ranbir is currently shooting for Brahmastra with Alia Bhatt. The movie is being helmed by Ayan Mukerji and bankrolled by Karan Johar's Dharma Productions.
