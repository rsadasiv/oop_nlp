Angad Bedi and Neha Dhupia’s wedding was nothing short of a surprise. Though there is a constant buzz about their marriage, not many know about the story of their wedding ring.
A source close to the couple reveals that the wedding ring has been passed from generations and this is the third generation which is wearing it.
“This is a family legacy that is now passed on to Neha and Angad. His parents have been married for the past 40 years and now they want to see the happiness and togetherness forever for the newly-weds. The ring signifies those sentiments,” adds the source.
