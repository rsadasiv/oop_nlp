A music teacher from Thane killed his son before killing himself over debt and marital discord, according to the suicide note found from his home, the police said.
On Wednesday afternoon, Shoumik Ghosh, 39, a resident of Vijay Enclave, killed his seven-year-old son, Ekansh, and then hanged himself. He was allegedly reeling under heavy debts and struggling with a failed second marriage, the police said. Ghosh took music classes in nearby areas and also organised music concerts.
The matter came to light when his driver went to his house but nobody answered the door. The police was called in. They had to break open the door, only to find Ghosh hanging from the ceiling fan in his balcony. The child lay lifeless on the bed.
"We are not sure if the child was strangled or smothered. It will be clear after the post-mortem report," said senior inspector DS Dhole.
"Ekansh was his son from his first wife. Ghosh had remarried last year. But differences between him and his second wife escalated due to his alcohol dependency and profligate habits," the officer said. "He sold 50-60 tolas of her gold jewellery. She left him three months back," he said.
"In his suicide note he said that he was depressed due to debts and his failed marriage, and was therefore committing suicide. He said his body should not be handed over to anyone," said Dhole.
