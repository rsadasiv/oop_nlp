A domestic tussle between a husband and a wife took an ugly turn when the husband attempted to shoot his wife, and upon missing threw acid on her, injuring her seriously, before fleeing. The incident happened at Haringhata area of Nadia district, late on Monday night.
The accused, 30-year-old Kausar Sheikh, had married to 23-year-old Salima Bibi, a resident of Ward 8 of Gayeshpur Municipality of Nadia, about five years ago. They have a daughter.
According to a complaint filed by Salima's father, Kausar was not interested in being in a relationship with Salima. "Domestic problems started soon after marriage. It would often lead to a noisy brawl. He used to torture Salima physically and mentally. On many occasions, he would leave Salima at her father's place, following a fight, and then would take her back with him after a couple of days. It had become normal," said a family member of Salima.
On Monday, a heated argument took place between the two and at one point, allegedly Kausar took out a pistol and fired at Salima. After missing her, in a fit of rage, he threw acid at her and then fled the scene. Neighbours initially took Salima to a local hospital, but when her condition deteriorated she was transferred to Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital at Kalyani.
