Like many B-Town actors, Sidharth Malhotra, too, doesn’t talk much about his love life. However, he admits that currently, he is single. In a candid chat, the actor tells us why he is staying out of the dating arena right now and the fickle friendships in Bollywood. Read on...
Professionally, I don’t have any regrets. I have never wanted to do the same thing. I have learnt something from every film. Yes, of course, the best is yet to come. Personally, too (pauses), there’s nothing. You can’t really call them regrets. Right now, I don’t have the luxury of choosing my personal life over my professional life. In this phase of my life, I have no time or space for it.
Yes, I’m single. I’m not looking for love right now as well. I came to Mumbai with a dream. I need to do a lot of things to achieve my goals. I want to put all my energies in it.
Marriage is definitely not on the cards. It’s not a priority. I’m not thinking about settling down right now. Eventually, hopefully, I will. Maybe, before I turn 40! That means, I still have seven years in hand. My professional life has to take off first. I have to be in a place where I’m satisfied with it. Clearly, I am not at that stage yet.
Yes, there is pressure from the family. Like most other parents, they also want to see me settle down. But I know I can handle them and they, too, understand that work is my top priority. They might broach the topic sometimes, but they don’t push it, so I’m happy.
I cannot call them friends; they are all colleagues. To confuse both would be futile. To have any expectation of them would be wrong. Yes, of course, some of them do become close associations, but I have no opinion on how and what people deal with. I don’t know anyone here who’s my relative or family. I only know them through work.
