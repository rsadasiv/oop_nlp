There have been several incidents of weddings being called-off. Some are broken over dowry and some over the drinking habits, but in Uttar Pradesh, a wedding was called off alleging that the bride spends too much time on WhatsApp.
The incident took place in Uttar Pradesh’s Amroha district, reported Hindustan Times.
Rhe bride and her relatives were waiting for the bridegroom and his relatives to arrive. However, on the day of the wedding, they were told that the marriage has been called off due to her habit of 'excessive use of WhatsApp', said a report.
However, the bride's family refused the allegation and accused the bridegroom family of demanding Rs 65 lakh in dowry.
The girl's father has lodged the complaint against the bridegroom’s family.
Earlier this year in June, a bride in Bihar's Saran refused to marry her groom as he behaved in 'strange manner' after lightning.
In April this year, marriage was called off in Uttar Pradesh after a heated argument ensued between a close relative of the bride and a cousin of the groom over an extra rasgulla.
Last year in April, a wedding was called off in Muzaffarnagar by the grooms family after they found out that meat was not served in the function.
In June 2017, the bride called off the wedding in Uttar Pradesh's Shahjahanpur, just before rituals were to begin after she found groom's 'nagin' dance embarrassing.
In 2016, shortage of ice-cream in a marriage party led to heated argument between the bride and groom sides and finally resulted in brick-batting in which three police personnel were injured and the wedding was cancelled.
