Recently, South actress Nikesha Patel, who made her debut opposite Pawal Kalyan in Puli, grabbed a lot of eyeballs when she expressed during an interview that she wants to marry ace choreographer-turned-director Prabhudheva. In a media interaction, the Puli actress was quizzed if she would like to work with Prabhudheva some day. On this, the actress apparently said, "You are asking about doing a movie with Prabhu Deva but I want to marry Prabhu Deva.” 
Looks like her answer to the question gave way to rumours of her marrying Prabhudheva. In fact, the speculations became too-much-to-handle and the actress had to issue a clarification, saying that her answer was misconstrued. 
Nikesha took to her social media page and shared, "“I’m so fed up with media calls last few days its about time I clarify this is not true…this news has been completely misunderstood. I’m busy with work and family.”
