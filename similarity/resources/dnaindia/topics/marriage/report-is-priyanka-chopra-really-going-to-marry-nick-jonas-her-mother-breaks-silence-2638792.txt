Priyanka Copra and Nick Jonas have been painting the town red with their rumoured romance. The duo has been grabbing the eyeballs both in the country and in the west. Be it numerous dinner dates or navigating the streets of New York together, the two are already giving us all some major couple goals. 
During their recent short trip to India, both Priyanka and Nick were seen wearing promise rings. Rumour mills have been busy churning that they are likely to get engaged pretty soon. Speculations about marriage being on cards for Priyanka have also been doing the rounds for wuite sometime now. 
But is that really the case? Is Priyanka's family really thinking seriously about the wedding of the actress? Well, when PC's mom Madhu Chopra was quizzed the same during a media interaction, she said, "Are you serious? If you are, then we'll also get serious about it." 
Well, her answer neither confirms nor denies the wedding rumours of Priyanka, in fact, leaves us further bewildered. So the million dollar question of will they or won't they, still remains unanswered. 
In the meantime, our desi girl is having the time of her life while celebrating her birthday with beau Nick in London. The actress went on a pre-birthday double dinner date with Nick's brother Joe Jonas and his fiance Sophie Turner (who plays Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones). 
PC and Nick later went on a romantic date to kick start the birthday madness. Buzz is that the duo is planning a quick getaway to Greece soon.
