A 17-year-old Muslim girl in Alwar managed to get her nikah cancelled by calling up the police and seeking help. The girl though a major under the Muslim marriage law, told the police that she was forcefully being married off and sought their help to stop the marriage.
The girl Ravanna Bano  was to get married on June 24. A resident of Lakshmangarh, Ravanna the eldest child of Akbaruddin Khan and Akbari called up the police on Thursday while pre-wedding festivities and rituals were going on at their home. She told the police that she was being forcefully married off when she wanted to study.      
“There was a call at Alwar police control room, the girl said she was a minor being forcefully married off and would kill herself if her marriage was not stopped. Our team responded to her distress call and reached their home. After initial resistance both families agreed to call off the marriage. But the girl refused to stay at home,” said Ram Swaroop officiating SHO, Lakshamangarh police station.   
It was a curious case for the police too because as per Muslim Law a girl can be married off at 16. “We could not treat her as minor, but since she was alleging forceful marriage we had to intervene. As the girl was refusing to stay at home and we have sent her to government women’s home,” added the SHO.    
Speaking on the issue chairperson of Rajasthan State Women’s Commission Suman Sharma informed, “Our local team has told us about the matter. If the girl wants to study, she will be supported and encouraged. We will also set up a feedback and monitoring system to ensure that her wishes are respected.”  
Ravanna is a student of second year at undergraduate college. She wants to study and make a career for herself. Incidentally Ravanna’s father Akbaruddin Khan is a retired teacher.
