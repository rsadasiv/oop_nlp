Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has welcomed the suggestion made by environment NGO Vanashakti and has asked BMC to study the feasibility of installing nets across storm water drains to collect waste before they enter creeks, rivers and sea.
MPCB submitted its affidavit to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), Western Zone bench hearing the petition filed by Vanashakti seeking implementation of the Maharashtra Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 2006 as well as implementations of several measures that would ensure stopping of sewage waste entering the sea along with solid waste.
During the hearing on July 2, MPCB stated that it has always tried it’s best to comply with the directions issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the provisions of Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016, says that its mandatory for every local body to segregate the waste. “Therefore applicant’s suggestion about installation of nets in storm water drains to stop solid waste from entering the creeks and the water bodies would be a welcome move after conducting feasibility study for the same,” the affidavit mentioned.
Stalin D, Director Conservation for NGO Vanashakti said that these nets can be installed all across the city in the storm water drains and will help ensure the non-biodegradable wastes will not reach the creeks or sea and it should be collected regularly by the BMC. “It’s a simple cost effective solution that will prevent tonnes of such waste from getting into the mangroves and sea and then returning on to the beaches, which several Mumbaikars are cleaning every weekend without realising that it was a never ending process,” he said adding that these wastes not only pollute the beaches but also impact and endanger the sensitive marine ecology and several marine species.
