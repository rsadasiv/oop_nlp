In a bid to provide employable skills to youth in environment sectors, the Environment ministry has put into motion a plan to train 5.6 lakh youth between 2018-2019 and 2020-21. Officially called the Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP), the training will be funded through the Environmental Information Systems (ENVIS) central scheme, which was allocated Rs 24 crore in the recent budget. To that end, in 2018-19, the ministry has proposed to train an estimated 80,000 people under various skill courses.
"This ministry is generally viewed as a regulator. But, we want to also look at employment generation and train people for environmental causes," said Dr Harsh Vardhan, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
Last June, the ministry began a three-month pilot on GSDP courses for skilling biodiversity conservationists and Para-taxonomists. This was done in select districts, covering nine bi-geographic regions. Under the pilot, 94 trainees successfully completed the basic course qualifying as skilled biodiversity conservationists and 154 students are enrolled for the advance course on para-taxonomy, expected to conclude in March, 2018. The training for pilot scheme is being carried out by the Botanical Survey of India and Zoological Survey of India respectively.
The expanded all India GSDP will include courses on pollution monitoring, effluent treatment plant operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting and auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, marine taxonomy, coastal biodiversity and bamboo management.
