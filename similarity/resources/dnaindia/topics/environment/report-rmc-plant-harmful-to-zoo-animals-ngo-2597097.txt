Dust generated from the Ready Mix Cement (RMC) plant set up at Byculla Zoo is hazardous to animals and trees at the zoo, claimed an activist from the Watchdog Foundation, a city-based NGO, who also said that the plant was working like slow poison for the animals, birds, reptiles, and trees at the zoo who were being subjected to the polluted air.
Godfrey Pimenta, a senior member of the Watchdog Foundation, said, "The dust generated from the plant will harm the environment of the zoo and it will affect the animals as well." Pimenta pointed out that dust from the cement plant settles on the water bodies in the zoo. He added that its impact will be seen in the long-run which the civic body must look into. The NGO also demanded that the plant should be shifted to another location.
The NGO highlighted similar issues at a cement plant in Somaiya Complex which is destroying the green cover near Sion heritage fort. To support his claim, Pimenta also referenced satellite images from 2017 and 2018 which show how the green cover around the area has reduced.
As per the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) norms, the commercial RMC plant should not be within 100 metres of buffer zone from human habitation. "In fact, in sensitive areas, the buffer zone should be more than 200 metres. But, in this case, the authority did not follow the norms before giving No Objection Certificate (NOC)," said Pimenta. He added that the state chief secretary has directed the concerned officials to take necessary action against those flouting norms after the NGO sent an email regarding the plant.
