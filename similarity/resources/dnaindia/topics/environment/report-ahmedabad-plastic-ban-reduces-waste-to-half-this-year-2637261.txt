The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's (AMC) efforts to effectively enforce its plastic ban has resulted in a reduction of garbage waste. This year, during Rath yatra, the amount of garbage that was collected came down to 12 tonnes from 25 tonnes last year.
Interestingly, against around 12 tonnes of plastic waste generated last year, this year it had been reduced to mere 500 kg. Mainly because of the ban on plastic water pouches, plastic glasses/cups, and bags, claim AMC officials.
"There is a drastic reduction in the waste collection during on the Rath yatra day. This is mainly because of the effective plastic ban in city. Last year, we had collected around 25 tonnes of garbage from the route, which has reduced to 12 tonnes this year," said Harshadray Solanki, Director of Solid Waste Management, AMC. "Main difference is the reduction in the plastic waste. This year, of all the waste collected, only 500 kg was plastic," added Solanki.
"The collected plastic has been sent to a private firm for recycling. Even their collectors have observed a reduction in plastic waste. People have voluntarily ditched the usage of plastic, which is good for the environment in a lot of ways," the director said.
