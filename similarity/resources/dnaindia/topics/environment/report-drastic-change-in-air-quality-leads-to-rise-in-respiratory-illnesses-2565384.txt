Medical experts in the national Capital have started witnessing a steep rise in the number of cases of asthma, lung infections and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
The experts are of the view that the rise in such cases is due to the air pollution which happens due to the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.
"The weather has changed drastically in the last two days. The cases of respiratory illness are on the higher side as compared to the last year. Also, the pollution levels have also gone up suddenly in this week. The weather is dusty and people who already have a history of respiratory illness are having a tough time," said Dr Raj Kumar, Head of Department, Pulmonology, Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute.
Experts have advised that the patients, particularly elder persons and newborns should take extra precautionary measures."Newborn and elderly should stay alert and take preventive measures. The weather is going to be worse in the next three to five days," said Dr KK Sethi, Chairman and Managing Director of the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute.
Even the city residents are feeling the change."Carrying an inhaler has become a must in this weather. There is dust in the air which is also causing irritation in the throat," said Aman Sharma, a resident of West Delhi. Singh was diagnosed with asthma three years back and since then Delhi's high pollution level gives him a tough time every year during winters.
"One should cover his/her face while travelling. Even staying indoors is not safe as the suspended particles enter through windows," says Dr JC Suri, HOD, Pulmonary Medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.
