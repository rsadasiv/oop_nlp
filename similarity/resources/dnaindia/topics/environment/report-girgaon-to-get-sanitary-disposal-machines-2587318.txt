Girgaon residents are coming up with a plan to install sanitary napkin disposal machines at various locations in the area for women residents. The local citizen group, Aamhi Girgaonkar, had a meeting with the machine manufacturers on Wednesday, February 21, and will soon be setting up disposal machines in at least five main locations of the area.
Speaking about the initiative to install the machine, Shilpa Nayak, member of Aamhi Girgaonkar, said, “The planning to install disposal machine was started two years ago, but not many of them were aware of this technology. Also, the women are too shy to come forward and accept the concept. But now, through media and a movie, many women are aware of the concept. While installing the machines, we also organize presentations to make women aware of how the machine works and it’s impact.”
While the group has located few schools and main junctions of Girgaon area, the first location to install the machine will be Bhimabai Rane School. The funds will be collected among the group to install the machine and maintain it further.
Gaurav Sagwekar of Aamhi Girgaonkar, explained, “The members will be contributing funds. A telephone booth kind of structure will be set-up in which the machine will be installed so that women don’t feel awkward while coming to dispose of the sanitary napkins. We will also be assigning a worker to maintain the machine. The entire cost will be taken care by our group.”  
According to members, they came up with the idea keeping in mind the hygiene of the women during menstruation days. “Many a times, the women throw it in a dustbin or wrap it in a plastic bags and throw it in the nullah. It is harmful to the environment due to which we want to install the machine,” added Gaurav.
