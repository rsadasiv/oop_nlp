The Bombay High Court on Thursday responded to a PIL filed by Thane-based green activist Rohit Joshi against the Thane Municipal Corporation. In his PIL, Joshi told the court that waterfront development undertaken by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) should be stopped as it is harming the environment and is also against CRZ norms. In its response, the civic body has told the court verbally that it will stop the dumping of debris and will file an affidavit in the matter in three weeks. Thursday was also incidentally the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem.
A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla was hearing the PIL filed by Joshi on July 20. TMC’s waterfront development project is a part of the smart city scheme. Under this project, a stretch of over 10.58 km from Mumbra, Gaimukh to Ghodbunder road and other locations along Thane creek were to be developed with jogging tracks, walkways, play areas, gyms, food courts, gazebos, etc.
Joshi, in his petition, has alleged TMC’s project will in fact lead to floods in Thane. “Since the area near the creek where the development is being undertaken is a wetland and below the road’s level, the TMC is dumping debris to raise its height.  This will, in turn, lead to floods at Ghodbunder road and in the areas where the waterfront is being developed,” said Joshi.  “These mangroves are like sponges which absorb water during high tide and floods and dumping debris on them will lead to floods in the city,” he said.
He also said that the TMC has violated the CRZ (coastal regulatory zone) norms under this project. He further said that though the TMC claims to have necessary CRZ permissions, dumping on mangroves is illegal.
On July 26, the TMC told the HC that the debris had not been dumped by them. And that it was the remnant of illegal structures demolished by them. The matter will come up for hearing next on August 28 when the TMC is to file its reply.
