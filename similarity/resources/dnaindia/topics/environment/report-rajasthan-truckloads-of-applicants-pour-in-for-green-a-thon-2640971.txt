A unique initiative ‘Green-A-Thon’ by the state pollution control board and department of Information technology and communication  (DoITC) is receiving overwhelming response. The event proposed to promote application of pollution-free and sustainable technologies has been introduced as part of the Digifest of DoITC department from this year. The organising department received more than 3,000 applications for the event, however, due to space constraint, nearly 10 per cent of these got selected for the final showdown. 
“The number of applications has increased six folds as compared to the first Green-A-Thon held few months earlier. These included equal number of proposals for both IT base and non IT base projects. We selected the best 300 of them to be presented at the main event,” a senior official from DoITC said.
Government has provisioned travel allowance for all the selected applicants to facilitate travel to the event venue in Bikaner. The top three applicants will be awarded financial support of Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh by the department of environment, Rajasthan state pollution control board for implementation of the project. There are also consolation prizes to promote innovation and sustainable development. 
Rajasthan is the only state to hold such an event for promotion of green technologies. The event has been included as one of the sections of the DoITC digifest. The fest started in 2016 to develop and strengthen technological ecosystem in state and it has since become India’s largest technology and startup festival. The last edition of was held in Jaipur that recorded a footfall of more than 1 lakh participants and visitors across the globe. 
The fifth edition of the fest will commence in Bikaner from Wednesday and will have five major events in three-day period. The major attraction of the event remains ‘Hackathon’, which again is the largest in the country. The 24-hour marathon coding competition registered over 18,000 competitors during its last edition, the number of these has though been decreased by a third in the current edition due to space constraints.
The organising department received more than 3,000 applications, however, nearly 10% of these got selected for the final showdown.
