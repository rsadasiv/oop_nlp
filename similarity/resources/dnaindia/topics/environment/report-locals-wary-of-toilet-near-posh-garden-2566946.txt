The Cuffe Parade Residents Association (CPRA) and the Association of Colaba and Cuffe Parade Residents (ACCPR) have come together to oppose BMC's proposal to build four toilet complexes near Colaba Woods garden. The residents fear that the toilets will become a den for drug addicts and encourage illegal activities. In a letter to Kiran Dighavkar, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, BMC, CPRA have strongly opposed the proposal.
The BMC plans to demolish the existing toilet blocks at Sadhu Vaswani Marg but the residents have stated that the garden is a precious green lung and a unique botanical library for the residents of Cuffe Parade, and said that it is a safe study area for students and a recreation space for children and senior citizens which should not be turned into a den for drug addicts.
"Our locality is already dealing with the menace of drug addicts and building a public toilet complex will only lead to an increase in such activities as the drug addicts will squatter near the toilet blocks which will turn away residents from visiting the garden. We had also proposed maintaining the garden jointly which is yet to be approved," said Padmakar Nandekar, Secretary General, CPRA. "The toilet blocks are not maintained properly by the contractors which will further worsen the atmosphere. The garden being located beside the toilet would lead to a stench and an unsafe environment," added Nandekar.
Parag Udani from ACCPR, said, "The residents must feel safe while visiting the garden. The toilet blocks being developed near the garden will increase illegal activities in the locality. The civic body can choose adifferent location for the toilet blocks."
