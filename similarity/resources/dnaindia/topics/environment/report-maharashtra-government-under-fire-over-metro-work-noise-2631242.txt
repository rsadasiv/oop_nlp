The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the state to specify noise pollution rules set for the contractor of the Metro 3 project between Colaba and Seepz.
A division bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla, while hearing a plea filed by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation limited seeking permission to carry out the Metro construction work for 18 months round the clock, said "As a state you have done nothing. No rules have been framed. Have you told the contractor to follow noise decibel levels? Have the standards been set?" The bench further grilled the government over the lack of a grievance redressal mechanism in place for residents.
Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the state government, argued that Metro railway is covered under a special act and thus noise pollution norms are not applicable to it. However, the court reminded him that the Constitution of India assures the people the right to live in a pollution free environment and the state is bound to uphold the same. Kumbhakoni argued it has to be considered how the people would benefit from the construction of the Metro project in future.
The High Court bench has now posted the matter for further hearing to July 2. The state has assured that it would come up with a redressal mechanism by then, and also said that it would inform the contractor about the clauses regarding decibel limits.
The Bombay High Court asked the state if it has informed the contractor about the noise pollution rules.
It also asked why a grievance redressal mechanism for locals is not in place yet.
