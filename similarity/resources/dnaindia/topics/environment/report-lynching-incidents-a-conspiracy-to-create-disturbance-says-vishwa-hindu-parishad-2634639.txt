The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) alleged on Saturday that the mob lynching incidents and the spurt in violence against Dalits were part of a conspiracy to create disturbance in the country.
"There is a conspiracy to create disturbance in the country," VHP's joint general secretary Surendra Jain, told reporters.
He was referring to the series of mob lynching incidents and cases of violence targeted at Dalits that have taken place in different states in recent months.
"Those arrested for Bhima-Koregaon violence have said that they wanted to create disturbance and a violent environment to destabilise the country," he said, adding that a similar design could be seen behind the sudden spurt in mob lynching cases.
The VHP leader also warned "jihadists, Maoists, and Congress" against attempts to delay the ongoing hearing about the Ram Mandir issue in the Supreme Court.
"When hearing in the Ram janmabhoomi case is in the final stages in the Supreme Court, it is not correct to put pressure on the government to come out with a law on Ram Mandir. Efforts should instead be made for speedy hearing of the case. If an appropriate decision regarding the temple is not made by August, we will discuss with religious seers, and launch a nation-wide agitation," Jain said.
Jain took potshots at former VHP chief Pravin Togadia, who recently floated the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP) after exiting VHP, saying a number of such outfits had come and gone over the years. He added that Togadia was not their competitor, but warned him against attempts to damage the outfit.
