Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken into consideration the proposal made by Girgaum locals to install sanitary pad disposal machines in building premises and mandating the same in upcoming building projects. Residents believe this will help them get rid of the sanitary pads properly instead of harming the environment.
The local group, Aamhi Girgaumkar had written a letter to the chief minister. The letter included a request to the chief minister to make amends in the building permissions, and mentioned that every building should have either a dedicated spot or a machine for disposing sanitary pads. Even during Holi, the locals had made sanitary napkins, its disposal and usage as one of the prime agenda.
The letter signed by Shilpa Nayak,secretary of Aamhi Girgaumkar, reads, "During period, the biggest challenge for every woman is disposal of sanitary pads. Because of no option available, women are forced to wrap it in a plastic bag and throw it along with other garbage. This is impacting the environment adversely and impacting the health too. This problem doesn't arise in our area, hence we have got sanitary disposal machines but we cannot reach every building and every place. Hence, it be made mandatory in every building permission that the sanitary pad disposal machines be made available and in future buildings there be a spot reserved for it."
When contacted, Nayak claimed that she has written the letter to the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Aaditya Thackeray, and the commissioner of Municipal Corporation. "I have already received a reply from the chief ministers office within three days of filing the letter with his office. In old buildings there are no places where one can have these machines but the new buildings when they redevelop such systems can be easily made place for. It will help women to a larger extent."
During Holi and even during Gudi Padwa, the locals had put the sanitary pad disposal machines in Girgaum on display to spread awareness.
When contacted Fadanvis said, "It is a good suggestion and we will try to work on it."
