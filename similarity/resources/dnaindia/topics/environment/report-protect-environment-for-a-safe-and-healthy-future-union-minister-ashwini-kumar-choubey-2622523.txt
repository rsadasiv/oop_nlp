'Pollution Explosion: Threat to Environment', a special event to mark the occasion of World Environment Day was organised in the city by India Eye International Human Rights Organization on Tuesday. The event was graced by Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, who was the chief guest.
"We all should be guided by the philosophy of vasudhaiva kutumbakam which means the world is one family. We should all strive to protect our environment to the best of our abilities in order to gift a safe and healthy planet for our posterity", said Choubey to a three-hundred-plus gathering present on the occasion.
The minister also highlighted the need to strike a sustainable balance between the demands of growth and the exploitation of nature for the same. "We cannot ignore the growth of the country but we also need to assess and evaluate the parameters that can harm the environment", he added.
Rakesh Sharma, the chief organiser of the event, raised concerns in his inaugural address about the slow pace of initiatives around the globe to protect and restore the environment.
"Ever since the first World Environment Day was observed by the United Nations in 1974, we have adopted 45 different slogans to work towards protecting the environment. But the results so far are not promising enough. We must enlarge and speed up our efforts before it is too late", Sharma asserted.
Tuesday's event was also graced by Sadhvi Bhagwati Saraswati, an American lady working for the Clean Ganga Project in Rishikesh. Delivering the keynote address, she urged everyone not to indulge in symbolic environmentalism but rather treat every day of the year as the World Environment Day.
A panel discussion by leading environmentalists from across the country on various issues related to pollution was another highlight of the event. The panel also deliberated on several other issues threatening the environment and focused on the need to adopt an inclusive approach to growth and development.
A total of thirteen environmental activists engaged in different walks of life were invited from different parts of the country and were felicitated for their contributions. The event came to an end with a prize distribution ceremony to more than forty winning students of essay writing and painting competitions held at the national level by the organizers ahead of the World Environment Day.
