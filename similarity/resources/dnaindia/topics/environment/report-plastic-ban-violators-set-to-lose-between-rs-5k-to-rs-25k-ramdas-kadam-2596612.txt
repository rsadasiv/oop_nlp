Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam on Thursday announced that the state government will charge a minimum fine of Rs 5,000 and maximum of Rs 25,000 if someone is found manufacturing and using banned plastic.
Talking to DNA on Thursday, Kadam reiterated the government's decision of banning the use of plastic in the state, "We will give a month's buffer period for plastic manufacturers to dispose of their produce. We will stop the complete manufacture and use of plastic bags in Maharashtra. If anyone violates the ban then there will be a minimum of Rs 5,000 and maximum of Rs 25,000 fine or three-month imprisonment."
Kadam said that Shiv Sena youth leader Aditya Thackeray and Amruta Fadnavis, wife of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, played an instrumental role behind the decision. "Aditya himself wrote me a letter asking for the ban on plastic. Mrs Fadnavis had also called a meeting with NGO and film actress Juhi Chawla who is working to protect the environment."
Kadam said that the government will take steps to encourage people to use cotton carry bags. "We had given Rs 5 crore to the BMC to make cotton and jute carry bags. We will make funds available in every district to purchase cotton bags. We will make use of our CSR fund and give the contract to manufacture cotton bags to women Self Help Groups," added the minister.
