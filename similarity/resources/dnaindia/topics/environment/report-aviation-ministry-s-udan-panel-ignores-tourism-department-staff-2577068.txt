The Centre's air connectivity programme, the UDAN Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) has ruffled the feathers of another department the wrong way. A committee formed under the civil aviation ministry to monitor and coordinate the programme has left out officials from the tourism ministry from co-opting into it. This despite a directive from the cabinet secretary, who sent the directive as part of another committee, a department-related one, of the tourism ministry of which both the ministries are a part.
The civil aviation ministry formed the Inter-Ministerial Monitoring-cum-Coordination Committee on April 4, 2017 to look after the implementation of the UDAN scheme. The committee had representations from the ministries of finance, defence, home, petroleum and natural gas. Apart from that, the chairman of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), representatives from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security) and officials of airlines and states concerned are also part of the panel. As per the notification announcing the committee, it was further decided that civil aviation secretary can co-opt any officer or expert.
However, officials of both the ministries meet as part of the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee on Tourism Sector (IMCCTS), which meets periodically to irons out issues relating to tourism. The committee, chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, has the secretaries of home affairs, external affairs, civil aviation, environment, forests & climate change, urban development, culture, AYUSH, textiles, road transport & highways, information & broadcasting, DONER, with the secretary of the ministry of tourism being the member convener.
During the meeting of the 6th IMCCTS meeting, it was decided that the tourism ministry will be co-opted as a member to "provide inputs about tourist destinations". The tourism ministry contended that since it is in the process of developing a pan-India thematic circuits, the regional connectivity scheme could benefit from it.
Yet, the civil aviation ministry has not heeded to either the decisions of the 6th IMCCTS meeting, or to a request from the ministry of tourism. In fact, the matter was even discussed in the 7th IMCCTS meeting held in October 2017. Despite the directive and discussions in the tourism committee meetings, the civil aviation ministry has not yes responded.
