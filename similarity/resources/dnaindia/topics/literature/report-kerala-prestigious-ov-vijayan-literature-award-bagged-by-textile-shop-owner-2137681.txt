The committee that decided the winning novelist included writers NS Madhavan, Dr Azad and Usha Nampoothirippad. They felt Ushakumari’s novel about a woman who lived in a remote village in the hills in 21st century Kerala was compelling. 
The novel is Ushakumari’s second one post Tharayum Kanchanayum Randu Poralikal’. The writer told Malayalam Manorama that Chithirapuram is one her favourite places and it somehow captured her mind.
