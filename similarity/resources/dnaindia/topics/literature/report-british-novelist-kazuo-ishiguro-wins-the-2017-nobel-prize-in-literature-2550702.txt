The Swedish Academy on Thursday have awarded English author Kazuo Ishiguro as the Nobel laurete for English.
"The highest honour was given to Ishiguro, who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world,” the Academy said in its annoucement.
The Academy praised Ishiguro's works which are “marked by a carefully restrained mode of expression, independent of whatever events are taking place”.
Ishiguro’s latest novel, “The Buried Giant” (2015) magnificently explores how memory relates to oblivion, history to the present, and fantasy to reality.
With the dystopian work in “Never Let Me Go” (2005), Ishiguro introduced a cold undercurrent of science fiction into his work.
Ishiguro’s most renowned novel, ”The Remains of the Day” (1989), was turned into film with Anthony Hopkins.
This year, with the likes of Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami and Nigerian writer Ngugi Wa Thiongo, the choice came as a surprise.
Ishiguro's choice have drawn cracks in the Japanese media as they had high hopes over their favourite Murakami. However, this win may work as a consolation for the Japanese lads as the winner is of Japanese origin. He was born in Nagasaki in Japan in 1984. Ishiguro’s family moved to the United Kingdom when he was five years old.
Last year, the Academy suprised everyone by announcing musician and songwriter Bob Dylan as the winner of the prestigious award.
At least 240 proposals were recieved and approved by the Academy for this year and 195 candidates were nominated.
