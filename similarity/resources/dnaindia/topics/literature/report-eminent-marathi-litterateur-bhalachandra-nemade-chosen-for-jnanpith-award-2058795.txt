Eminent Marathi litterateur Bhalachandra Nemade has been chosen for the 50th Jnanpith Award for 2014. His nomination was decided at a meeting of the Jnanpith selection board chaired by writer and scholar Namwar Singh.
Born in 1938, Namade occupies a unique place in Marathi literature. His hugely celebrated works, from "Kosala", 1963 to his recently-published magnum opus "Hindu", have earned him a reputation as a self-aware, globally conscious and alert writer, said a statement issued by Bharatiya Jnanpith on Friday.
He has also been conferred the Padma Shri and has won the Sahitya Akademi Award besides many other accolades.
