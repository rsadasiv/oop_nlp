A panel of sleep experts has declared some new sleep guidelines for almost all the age groups.
The National Sleep Foundation issued the recommendations for all and mentioned that newborns (0-3 months) should sleep 14-17 hours each day, infants (4-11 months) should sleep 12-15 hours, toddlers (1-2 years) should sleep 11-14 hours, preschoolers (3-5) should sleep 10-13 hours, and school age children (6-13) should sleep 9-11 hours every day.
The guidelines continued by stating that teenagers (14-17) should sleep 8-10 hours, younger adults (18-25) should sleep 7-9 hours, adults (26-64) should sleep 7-9 hours, whereas older adults (65+) should sleep 7-8 hours each day.
Charles A. Czeisler, PhD, MD, chairman of the board of the National Sleep Foundation, said that this was the first time that any professional organisation has developed age-specific recommended sleep durations based on a rigorous, systematic review of the world scientific literature relating sleep duration to health, performance and safety.
David Cloud, CEO of the National Sleep Foundation told that the National Sleep Foundation's 'Sleep Duration Recommendations' would help individuals make sleep schedules that are within a healthy range. The report is published in Sleep Health, an official journal of National Sleep Foundation.
