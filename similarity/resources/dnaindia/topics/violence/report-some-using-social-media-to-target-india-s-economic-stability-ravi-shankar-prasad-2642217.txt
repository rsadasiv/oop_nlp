Rubbishing allegations that the ruling party is behind promoting fake news to cause unrest and violence in the country, Minister for Information and Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday told Rajya Sabha that social media platforms are being abused for "weaponisation of information against India's strategic interest and economic stability". "But the government is committed to deter such action," Prasad said.
He added that after the government issued notice to WhatsApp, the company reduced number of forwards to five. "It now plans to remove the forward button and also bring fact checking and fake news verification mechanism," Prasad said.
Replying to a calling attention motion on "Misuse of fake news causing unrest and violence", Prasad said that the government is also thinking of locating grievance officer.
"The duty of such grievance officer will not only be to receive grievances on real time basis but also to inform law enforcement agencies," the minister said.

The government plans to promote initiatives to increase awareness among the citizens to become adept in noticing fake news and to avoid becoming a party to viral circulation of fake news. "The government will strengthen the legal framework to ensure that social media and instant messaging service providers targeting Indian users do not deprive them of the right to hold proceedings in India and protecting Indian laws," Prasad said.
During the debate, the Opposition members expressed concern and accused government of inaction. Many members, including Ghulam Nabi Azad of Congress, expressed "shock" and "shame" at ministers and MLAs of ruling party felicitating and garlanding people allegedly involved in mob violence. "They should be dropped," Azad said.
RJD's Manoj Jha warned that if measures were not taken to stop hate messages on social media, it would spill on to the streets. He also mentioned about the incidents involving trolling of senior ministers on social media.
Derek O'Brien of TMC alleged that the BJP came to power in 2014 using social media to create the culture of social mobs. He sought to know from Prasad why BJP MPs, MLAs and ministers were demanding that Facebook bring back POSTCARD news. Javed Ali Khan from Samajwadi Party said the government has "washed off its hands", saying it does not regulate social media.
