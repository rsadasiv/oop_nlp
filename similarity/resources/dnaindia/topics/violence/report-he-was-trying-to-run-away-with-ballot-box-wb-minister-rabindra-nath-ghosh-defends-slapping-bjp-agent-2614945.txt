Ballot boxes were looted at gunpoint on Monday by unidentified people at polling booths in West Bengalâ€™s Murshidabad where Panchayat Election is underway.
The ongoing Panchayat Election saw huge-scale clashes between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers, resulting in the death of one.
