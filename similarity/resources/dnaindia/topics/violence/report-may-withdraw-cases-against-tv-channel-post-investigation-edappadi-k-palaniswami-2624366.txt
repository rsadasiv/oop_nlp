Asserting that the state government respects freedom of expression and the press, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday said the Opposition demand to withdraw the cases filed against Tamil news channel Puthiya Thalaimurai, for allegedly attempting to incite tension during a roundtable, would be considered once the investigation was completed.
Responding to a special call attention motion by members of the Opposition DMK, Congress and others in the State Assembly, he said that the media should act responsibly while holding programmes in a communally-sensitive city like Coimbatore, selecting the topic and speakers.
Pointing out the reasons mentioned in the FIR filed against the channel and director Ameer, he said that trouble started when film director Ameer, who was among several political leaders participated in the roundtable on "Are continuous protests for people's basic needs? Or for political reasons?'', made a controversial remark. Referring to the protests by various media associations and political parties, who are condemning the decision to slap charges against the Channel and Ameer, while stating that it was an affront on freedom of expression, and demanding that the case be withdrawn, Palaniswami said a decision would be taken after the investigation.
During the debate, state BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan said that those who engage in violence and burn public properties during protests are 'anti-social elements'. To which, Ameer said if those who burnt vehicles in Tuticorin are 'anti-social', vandalism by Hindu groups after murder of Hindu Munnani leader Sasikumar in Coimbatore in 2016 are also anti-socials.
