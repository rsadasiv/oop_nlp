Reacting to the split-up between ruling partners in J&K, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the alliance of opportunism had set fire to the state. “The opportunistic BJP-PDP alliance set fire to J&K, killing many innocent people including our brave soldiers. It cost India strategically & destroyed years of UPA’s hard work. The damage will continue under President’s rule. Incompetence, arrogance & hatred always fails,” Gandhi tweeted. 
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said the consequences will be good for the people of the state and said he had told PM Modi that this was a Himalayan blunder on the Floor of the House in March 2015.
“While I hold the PDP responsible for this, the BJP and Centre cannot shy away from its responsibility in the escalation of violence in the Valley. The initiative for the alliance was taken by no less than the PM,” said the former J&K CM.
