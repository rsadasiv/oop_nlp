It has become a common trend to take the law into one's hands these days and this has resulted in the rise in lynching cases. People don't even bat an eyelid before killing another on the mere suspicion of an act and this dangerous trend is fast catching up.
Smita Pandey, a psychologist says, mob lynching is very different from any other physical harm or violence or murder as it is done by the crowd before the crowd. Actually, in the case of lynching, the fear of law and order or state is missing and mostly it challenges the law and state authorities thus it is extrajudicial or execution or illegal enforcement of punishment. "The people or crowd, involved in lynching have the same goal, social identity, shared collective emotions. Intentions of the crowd are always very clear --- they aim violence and killing. In lynching, the crowd always want to prove their social, political identity and conformity with the group. Individuals who get involved in lynching are always charged with emotions to prove and establish some thoughts, beliefs, identity and these emotions are mostly guided by prejudice and biases," Pandey said.
