With another death on Friday, the death toll in Thursday’s violence at Darivit High School in North Dinajpore has risen to two.
Tapas Burman, the 20-year-old former student of the school, succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. He used to run a sweetmeat shop in the locality where violence erupted on Thursday.
On Thursday, Rajesh Sarkar, a former student of the school, was killed and bullet injuries were found on his body.
The BJP called a 12-hour bandh on Friday and bandh supporters vandalised two government buses and few two wheelers. The bandh had a lukewarm response in the area with several shops shut and fewer vehicles plying.
State education minister Partha Chatterjee said that the RSS was involved in the violence. “The district inspector of schools, Rabinidra Kumar Mondal had taken a decision on his own to appoint teachers without the knowledge of the state. I have talked to him and he has been immediately suspended. We are certain that RSS had brought in people from outside and instrumented the murder. Those RSS and BJP people will not be spared,” Chatterjee said.
BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, on the other hand, demanded a CBI inquiry in to the matter.
