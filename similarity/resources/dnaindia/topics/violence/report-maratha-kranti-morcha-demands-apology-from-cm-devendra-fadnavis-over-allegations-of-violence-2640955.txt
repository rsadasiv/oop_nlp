Claiming that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the Maratha community of planning to stir up violence in the holy town of Pandharpur, the members of Maratha Kranti Morcha have demanded an apology from the Chief Minister.
"The Chief Minister has used objectionable language against the Maratha community. He has accused that members from the community were planning to stir up violence to disrupt his visit to Vitthal temple in Pandharpur. He has insulted the entire Maratha community with such baseless allegations, he should apologise for his statements," Pravin Gaikwad, coordinator of Maratha Kranti Morcha today said.
While explaining why Fadnavis cancelled his Pandharpur visit, the CM told media persons that there was an internal report from police that some people were going to create ruckus in Pandharpur which could have led to stampede, and since there were more than 10 lakh devotees present in Pandharpur, he decided to cancel his visit to avoid any law and order situation.
However, members of Maratha Kranti Morcha demanded the Chief Minister to make the report public. "As per his claims, he got a report that the Maratha community was involved in conspiring against the Warkaris. We ask him to make the report public," Gaikwad said.
Gaikwad also accused that Fadnavis cancelled his visit to Pandharpur due to personal reasons. "On Sunday it was his birthday. Apart from that, BJP president Amit Shah was also in Mumbai. Due to these reasons, he cancelled his visit. However, he gave the pretext of conspiracy, which is very unfortunate," he said.
He further claimed that the Maratha community has never resorted to violence for their demand. "The community has carried out 58 rallies across the state and not a single rally has witnessed any violence. The Chief Minister should have been careful while making such statements," Gaikwad added.
