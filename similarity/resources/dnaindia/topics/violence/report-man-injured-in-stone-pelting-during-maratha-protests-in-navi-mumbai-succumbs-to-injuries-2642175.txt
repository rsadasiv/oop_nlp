A 21-year-old man injured in stone-pelting in Navi Mumbai during Marathas' agitation for reservation succumbed to injuries, on Thursday.
The victim has been identified as Rohan Todkar, a resident of Kopar Khairane.
Todkar was admitted to JJ Hospital on Wednesday after he got injured. However, today doctors' declared him dead.
The matter is being investigated by PSI Karanjavane who is associated with JJ Marg Police Station.
The police had lobbed teargas shells and used baton-charge in Kopar Khairane area after a group of protesters stoned vehicles, clashed with local people and indulged in arson.
The mob then hurled stones in which some offices and shops were damaged. They also set fire to a police chowky (outpost) near D-Mart supermarket in sector 6. 
The bandh in Maharashtra called by pro-quota Maratha groups was marked by violence and arson. Protesters attacked buses, indulged in arson and pelted stones at local trains in several parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai and the adjoining Thane city.
However, after the bandh was called off shortly before 3 pm in Mumbai, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis released a statement in which he said the Maratha community should come forward for talks with the government instead of resorting to agitation and violence. The BJP leader also accused "certain leaders" of trying to create caste division in Maharashtra but did not elaborate.
Fadnavis said his government was committed to grant reservations in jobs and education to the Marathas, and pointed out that the government passed a law in this regard, but it was struck down by the high court.
Marathas, a politically-influential community constituting around 30 per cent of the state's population and a huge vote bank for the Congress-NCP combine, have been demanding reservation in jobs and education that has become a contentious issue. The bandh was called by Maratha Kranti Morcha and other groups.
Last Sunday, 27-year-old Kakasaheb Shinde, a pro-quota protester, jumped off a bridge over Godavari River in Aurangabad and died. This led to the agitation being stepped up.
