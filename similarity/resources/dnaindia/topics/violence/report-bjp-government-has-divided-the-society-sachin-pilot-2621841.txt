In the run up to the assembly polls slated to be held in December this year, the parties are grabbing every opportunity to make a connect with the people of the state. 
On Sunday, PCC chief Sachin Pilot targeted the Raje government over corruption while citing several scams that surfaced during the four-and-half year tenure of the BJP rule. 
He was addressing the public during ‘Mera Booth Mera Gaurav’ program at Chittorgarh’s Begun Assembly constituency on Sunday.
He also accused the Modi government for creating problems for people of scheduled caste on the issue of reservation. 
“In this government, people can’t expect to get their work done without paying bribe. Be it mines or anything else, all scams happened in the tenure of Raje government and no action has been taken so far,” said Pilot.
The state Congress head also raised issue of Bharat Bandh during which several innocent people of scheduled caste were booked for violence. 
“In the tenure of former prime minister Manmohan Singh no such incident like Bharat Bandh took place,” said Pilot. 
The farmer suicide and inflation were the other issues that Pilot addressed in his speech. He slammed the BJP government for ignoring the issues of the farmers and dividing the society on caste lines. 
Ge said the BJP has broken the spine of the common man with its anti-people policies while the Congress continuously served the people selflessly. 
“Instead of debating and sorting out issues in peoples’ interest, the BJP government has divided the society on caste and community lines. We have to take 36 castes together and ensure their welfare. I want to assure that after six months the Congress will form the government in Rajasthan,” said Pilot. 
He also accused the Raje government for disrespecting huge mandate given to her government as it has done nothing concrete in its tenure so far.
