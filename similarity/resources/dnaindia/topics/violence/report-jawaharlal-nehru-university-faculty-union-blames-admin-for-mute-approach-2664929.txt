The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers Association (JNUTA) is gunning for the varsity authorities now for being "mute spectator" to the mob violence that rocked the campus during students' union elections. The teachers' union has accused the administration for an "uneven approach", which has only "encourage and embolden the perpetrators of such violence".
The JNUTA expressed serious concern at the situation in the university where "several students, including many women, have been targets of mob violence within the university". In an official statement, the teachers' body said that the administration seems to have been standing by as a mute spectator. "An air of insecurity is prevailing in the campus as there are several reports of incidents and there is a palpable lack of response on the part of the administration."
They said that these incidents were undermining JNU's "great democratic traditions", alleging that the disciplinary powers were being used "very harshly and excessively" to penalise students and students' union activists protesting peacefully against the Administration's policies.
"We have also been similarly targeted while others indulging in violence (particularly against fellow students) have been favoured with kid glove treatment. The untoward incidents during the counting process of the recently conducted JNUSU elections have also seen a similar role of the administration," said Sonajharia Minz, President, JNUTA.
Meanwhile, the ABVP, in a press conference held on Tuesday, said the "Left goons" were out toÂ "teach them a lesson", vitiating the atmosphere by their threats and provocation. The leaders said that the Left have sought to "mob lynch" several of their members, "clearly emboldened" by their victory in the recently held JNUSU elections.
