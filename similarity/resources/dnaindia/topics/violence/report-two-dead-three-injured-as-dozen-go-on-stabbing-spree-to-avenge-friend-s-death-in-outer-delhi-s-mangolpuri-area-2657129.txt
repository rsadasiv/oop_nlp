The Mangolpuri area in Outer Delhi was a hotbed of violence on Wednesday evening when the friends of a 20-year-old man, who died in a clash with another man last week, went on a stabbing spree. Two people have died and three were injured even as heavy security was deployed in the area to ensure that the situation did not go out of hand, the police said.
According to the police, Abhishek alias Chuha (20) had had an argument with a man identified as Prince alias Kake (22) last week. During their argument, Abhishek was assaulted and stabbed by Prince's brother Rancho. Prince, on the other hand, also sustained injuries when Abhishek retaliated.
"We had registered cross-FIRs against both the parties. Based on Abhishek's complaint, a case under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) was registered. On Prince's complaint, a case under IPC section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) was registered," said Rajendra Sagar, additional DCP (Outer Delhi).
On Wednesday evening, Abhishek succumbed to his injuries after which around a dozen of his friend's marched to Prince's house to search for Rancho. None of them were present in the house and the accused men who were also in an inebriated condition went on a stabbing spree. Around five persons in two different blocks - I and M were stabbed. Two of them died while three others have been injured.
The deceased have been identified as Karan Veer who works as a painter and Dinesh Sharma who works at a factory in the Bahadurgarh area. The three injured have been identified as Vinay Kumar, Irshad and Suresh. It may be noted that the deceased/injured had no connection with Abhishek or Prince or the alleged accused men who attacked them.
According to the police, the accused men were drunk and wanted to avenge Abhishek's death and hence stabbed anyone and everyone who came in their way.
Teams were formed and informers were deployed after which some of them have been taken into custody. A case of murder has been registered at the Mongolpuri police station and further investigations are underway, the police said.
