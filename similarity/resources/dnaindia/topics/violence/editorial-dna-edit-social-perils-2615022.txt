Social media is now becoming a constant for our politicians, whether it is during polling time or otherwise. But as parties showed in the run-up to the crucial panchayat polls in West Bengal on Monday, the medium is now starting to take a dangerous turn.
According to reports, political parties in the state set up social media cells on polling day where they allegedly showed images and footage of rival parties capturing booths, threatening and inciting violence amongst people. Such moves obviously were an attempt to sway the voter on election day. This new trend is disturbing as it has the potential to ‘fix’ elections and also heighten tensions in communally-sensitive areas. 
Given that India has a number of state elections and with the national elections just a year away, the technology’s potential to spread misinformation is only likely to grow. The Election Commission (EC) has already laid down clear guidelines on campaigning for elections, but now it needs to consider — in conjunction with cyber experts, judges and political parties —  rules governing social media and how to implement them.
This is easier said than done though. Should social media be shut off in the run-up to a crucial election? Can it even be done? Should parties and party candidates, who are tweeting and Facebooking, be banned or fined? If so, how is this to be monitored and carried out?
The biggest threat though comes from the parties’ promise to highlight and circulate violent images of other parties on polling day. Continuous use of such methods will render the EC ineffective as an institution, and with it, a heavy blow will be dealt to the promise of free and fair polls. It’s thus crucial to get guidelines in place, otherwise parties will soon not need a Cambridge Analytica to manipulate voters.
