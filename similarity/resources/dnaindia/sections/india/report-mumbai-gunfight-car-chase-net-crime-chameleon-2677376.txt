A fierce exchange of bullets for hours netted a prize catch for the Navi Mumbai police on Saturday -- 26-year-old Faiyaz Khalid Shaikh and his associates.
The hardened criminal's name features on at least 90 FIRs (First Information Reports) in Navi Mumbai, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Vapi police stations.
The Panvel-resident's criminal bio-data includes robbery, attacking police teams, murder attempts, illegal possession of firearms, and also the odd chain-snatching attempt.
What has made Shaikh so hard to nab is his enthusiasm to change his appearance. "Shaikh is a master of disguise," says one police officer. "He frequently changes his looks and way of dressing to hoodwink the police. We have come across at least five distinctive looks."
On Friday night, Shaikh continued to add to his crime sheet -- he had committed two robberies in Khargar and threatened a car owner with a pistol before fleeing with his vehicle.
Navi Mumbai Police received a tip-off that Shaikh has taken shelter at his associate Sakharam Pawar's home in Nadhaal village in Raigad.
"We tried to get hold of Shaikh in the early hours of Saturday and he fired at the police party using his pistol," says an officer.
Two officers were saved by bulletproof jackets, but five policemen were injured in the skirmish.
The police fired back and injured Shaikh and his accomplice Haji Peer Mohammad Shaikh alias Salim.
"Shaikh and Salim tried to flee despite the injuries, but we caught up with them after a few kilometres. Pawar was arrested too," says Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Navi Mumbai Crime Branch).
Shaikh and Salim were rushed to a nearby hospital and later shifted to MGM Hospital at Kamothe for further treatment.
A case against Shaikh and his accomplices is registered at Khalapur police station for attacking police. Shaikh has also been booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.
"Shaikh's arrest is a big deal; citizens can heave a huge sigh of relief. He has been a big menace in Navi Mumbai and nearby areas for a while," an officer said, "He is ruthless and can even kill people to escape arrest"Shaikh had carried out life-threatening attacks on police parties on at least three prior occasions.
Recounting his last encounter with Shaikh, an officer said, "On the night of October 14, we intercepted Shaikh at Kahanivade toll point in Virar. When we tried to nab him, he fired at the police team and injured two officers."
