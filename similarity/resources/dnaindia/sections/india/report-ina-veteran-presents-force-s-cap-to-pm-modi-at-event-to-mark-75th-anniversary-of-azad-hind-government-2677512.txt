Indian National Army (INA) veteran Lalti Ram presented a cap of the pre-Independence force to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday at an event to mark the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the 'Azad Hind Sarkar' by freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose.
Lalti Ram, who is among the few INA members who are still alive, presented the cap to Modi before he hoisted the national tricolour at the historic Red Fort here.
"Netaji had promised an India where everyone has equal rights and equal opportunities. He had promised a prosperous nation which was proud of its traditions, development in all areas. He had promised to uproot 'divide and rule'. Even after so many years, those dreams remain unfulfilled,'' Modi said.
"We have reached 'Swaraj' after lakhs of sacrifices. It is our responsibility to maintain this 'Swaraj' with 'Suraaj'," he added.
Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, survivors of the INA, Indian armed forces veterans and followers of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose attended the event at the Red Fort.
Bose had established the provincial Azad Hind Government in Singapore on October 21, 1943.Â
