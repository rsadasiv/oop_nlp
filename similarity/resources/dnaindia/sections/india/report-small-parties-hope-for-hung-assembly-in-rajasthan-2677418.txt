President of Bharat Vahini Party Ghanshyam Tiwari predicts a hung Assembly and rise of a decisive third front in the state. In a media interaction, the former BJP leader and founder of BVP, claimed the BJP is set for a crushing loss, and Congress too will need support of others.
BVP, also also AAP and BSP, claims to contest all 200 seats. Tiwari, however, has been working for a consensus among the parties for a united ‘third’ position. The other smaller parties too want a hung Assembly, even as they campaign ahead with claims to form the next government.
“BJP and Congress may still emerge as the major parties, but the myth of Rajasthan being a two-party state will be shattered,” says a senior AAP leader. Most of the smaller parties leaders are in regular contact, though differences prevail. The issue of maintaining distance from BJP and Congress remains a point of contention for these parties. “It’s a matter of future concern and for now we are focusing on making a united presence felt and wait for the public verdict,” says Communist party leader Amra Ram.
Leaders of Left parties have also expressed a willingness to align with BVP. “The alliance will be with several parties and accordingly seat preferences will be decided. We are open for alliance to provide people a considerable option other than BJP and Congress,” says Amra Ram.
The Left parties have previously called for a united mega-alliance of Opposition parties. The Left-led ‘front’ already has seven parties, including SP on board, though their voteshare remains meagre.
