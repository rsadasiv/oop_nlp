Residents of Aman Apartments in Faridabad's Surajkund woke up on Saturday to see blood oozing out of the house on the building's ground floor.
Within minutes, they realised four siblings had hung themselves from ceiling fans, and the news spread like wildfire, reminding many of the tragic incident that took place in North Delhi's Burari in July this year.
Rajesh Mehta, a first-floor resident, said they will move out of the building now. "The smell and sight of bodies hanging is still fresh in my mind. If i can't get over it, I'll move out and look for another place. My children haven't seen anything and I don't want them to be curious. Memories will still haunt me every time I pass the ground floor though," he said.
Raj Kumar, the building caretaker, said the Mehtas might not be the only residents to move out. "The place will be labeled as haunted. Nobody would want to occupy the house, as they would fear it would bring losses to business," he said.
The Mathews family had been suffering from financial difficulties since quite some time, he said. "All tenants paid rent on time. However, they would usually pay only by the 10th or even 15th of every month," he added.
Another resident said the family kept to themselves and were rarely seen outdoors. "In the last six months, I haven't seen anybody visiting them. They would usually go to church or stay indoors. I tried speaking to them on a couple of occasions, but they refused to speak," said Nitin Meena, another resident.
Another elderly man from the neighbourhood claimed he had visited the Mathews residence to recite the Bible a few weeks ago.
The neighbours worry the house may be haunted and may bring losses to the neighbourhood. They say they will move out if they canâ€™t live down the memories attached to the place.
