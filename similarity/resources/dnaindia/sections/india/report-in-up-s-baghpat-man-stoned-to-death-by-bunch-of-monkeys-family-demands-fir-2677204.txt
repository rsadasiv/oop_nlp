In a bizarre case, a man from Baghpat was stoned to death by monkeys. The incident took place when the victim, identified as one Dharampal, had gone to collect some wood for haven at his home. 
According to a Times of India report, the family of the 72-year-old victim are demanding an FIR and say that the ‘real culprits’ — the monkeys — should be punished. 
The local police have so far not taken any ‘action’. The family says that the monkeys threw bricks at Dharampal, which hit his head, chest and legs. The victim died later in hospital during treatment. 
While the family seeks FIR, SHO Chitwan Singh says that the police can’t file a case as it would make the cops a laughing stock. 
This is not the first time that a monkey attack has claimed a human life. Earlier in April, a 17-day-old boy was snatched away by a monkey from his home in Odisha's Cuttack and later found dead in a well near his home.
The futile search 
The baby was sleeping next to his mother at their home in Talabasta village when the monkey snatched him, sources in the forest department said. 
The mother saw the monkey fleeing with her baby and raised an alarm. Thereafter, the villagers reported the incident to the authorities.
Forest department and fire services personnel reached the village and launched a massive operation to trace the baby.
A forest department official engaged in the rescue operation had said, "As the child has trouble crying, we cannot hear his voice. It has, therefore, become difficult for us to trace him in the forest." He said 30 forest department personnel in three teams led by Sangram Keshari Mohanty, the ranger of the Damapada Forest Range, are combing the nearby forest along with the villagers.
