Former chief minister of Maharashtra and Congress leader Ashok Chavan has criticised the Shiv Sena for not being serious about the Ayodhya temple matter, adding that the name of the temple is being taken as the 2019 general elections are inching closer.
Reacting on Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's upcoming visit to Ayodhya, Chavan told ANI on Saturday, "Uddhav Thackeray is giving new statements every other day. The Shiv Sena has never been serious on Ayodhya matter. Ayodhya name is being taken again and again because elections are approaching."
Upset with the delay in the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Thackeray, on October 18, announced that he would visit the city on November 25.
"We warn everyone who thinks that Hindutva has died. We are still alive. We are saddened that Ram Temple has not been constructed yet. I will visit Ayodhya on November 25," Thackeray had said.
Meanwhile, the Congress leader also responded to senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's recent remark that the Supreme Court cannot solve the Ram Temple issue because it is a matter of faith.
Chavan said, "Our country functions on the basis of the Constitution. Whatever decision will be taken by courts will be followed by the entire nation."
The long-standing Ram Mandir matter is pending before the Supreme Court for its final resolution. The matter will next be heard on October 29.
Earlier, the court had asked the stakeholders of the issue to resolve the matter amicably out of the court.
The Babri Masjid, built by Mughal emperor Babur in Ayodhya in 1528, was, on December 6, 1992, pulled down allegedly by a group of Hindu activists, claiming that the mosque was constructed after demolishing a Ram Temple that originally stood there.Â
