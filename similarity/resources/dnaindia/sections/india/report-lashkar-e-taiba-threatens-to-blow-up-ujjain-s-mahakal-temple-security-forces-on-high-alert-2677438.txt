Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistan-based terror group, has threatened to carry out series of attack in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. 
According to an HT report, Lashkar’s area commander Maulvi Abu Sheikh had written a warning note from Rawalpindi, which was ‘received’ by railway officials in Jaipur on September 29. 
The letter said that attacks will be carried out on October 20 and November 9. With October 20 passing off peacefully, the security agencies are on high alert for any untoward incident on November 9. The terror group will be specifically targeting railways stations across Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal, Gwalior, Katni and Jabalpur have been put on high alert. 
The threat comes at a time when two of these states are preparing for the state Assembly elections in December. Both Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh is witnessing intense poll campaigning by various political parties. 
Lashkar is the same group that carried out deadly 26/11 attacks in Mumbai in 2008. A group of 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET) terrorists from Pakistan carried out coordinated attacks in Mumbai from November 26 to 29 in 2008, which claimed 166 lives and left more than 300 injured.
Nine of the attackers were killed by police while lone survivor Ajmal Kasab was caught in Mumbai and hanged after being handed down a death sentence. Not only is the probe going slow, the masterminds Zaki-ur-Rehman and Hafiz Saeed are currently roaming freely in Pakistan.
Hafiz Saeed has launched a political outfit whereas Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi is reportedly raising funds for the outfit's terror activities. He is actively organising collection of donations in Punjab coinciding with the wheat harvesting season, said a report quoting sources. Zakiur Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Sadiq, Shahid Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younis Anjum – have been facing charges related to the attacks since 2009.
There were reports that a mosque in Haryana’s Palwal was built with help of Lashkar funds.
