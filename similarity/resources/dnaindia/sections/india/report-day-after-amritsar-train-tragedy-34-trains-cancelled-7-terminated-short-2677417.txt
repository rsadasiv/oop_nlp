Chaos reigned at New Delhi railway station on Saturday, as 34 trains were cancelled and seven more were terminated short, a day after the tragic accident in Amritsar where over 60 people watching Dussehra festivities were run over by a train.
The cancellations hit people from the capital who were planning an outing over the long weekend. Not only trains heading to Amritsar but also other train services throughout the northern belt were impacted. “My brother had gone to Beas a couple of days ago, and I was supposed to join him today, but my train was unfortunately cancelled,” said Jatin Arora, a resident of New Ashok Nagar. “I wish I had gone with my brother even if it involved taking a day off. Now I have to hope for another train or try for road ways.”
Cancellation of trains, however, resulted in a windfall for private bus operators, many of whom hiked their prices. “I was to attend my neice’s wedding, but since the Amritsar Shatabdi is short destined, I would have to try booking a bus seat. I hope the operators haven’t hiked their prices,” said SK Sharma, resident of Model town.
The Kashmere Gate Inter-State Bus Terminus saw increased commuter activity towards Amritsar and by evening, most buses were running full. “There are days when we even travel with empty seats, but today it took us just 15 minutes to fill the bus to capacity,” said Taufiq, a conductor in an Amritsar-bound Volvo bus.
