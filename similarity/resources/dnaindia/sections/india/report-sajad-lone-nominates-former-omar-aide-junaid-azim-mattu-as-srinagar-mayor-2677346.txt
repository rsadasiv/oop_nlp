Ending suspense, People’s Conference led by separatist-turned-MLA Sajad Lone nominated former National Conference spokesman Junaid Azim Mattu as party's candidate for the post of Mayor of Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC).
"Congratulations to PC Mayoral Candidate @Junaid_Mattu and the victorious candidates from PC for heralding a new change in Srinagar and thanks to Irfan Ansari and all my senior colleagues for his successful campaign management during the ULB elections", tweeted Lone after the results.
Mattu, who quit National Conference  on September  25 and decided to contest the urban local bodies (ULB) elections, won from three wards.  Mattu was contesting as independent.
"I am humbled by my nomination by @JKPC_ as the Mayoral Candidate and join @sajadlone in congratulating all the victorious candidates. We have emerged as the single largest group by a convincing margin and will be heading the movement for change in Srinagar inshallah", tweeted  Mattu.
Congress, which reluctantly joined the electoral fray, has emerged as single largest party winning 16 wards in the 74-member Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC).  Independents have won 53 wards and BJP four.
"I had earlier mentioned that we don’t have a common symbol allotted to us. That is the reason our candidates are shown as independents. We have taken six towns and are sure of getting the mayoral position in Srinagar," Lone  said.
On October 9, a political storm- hit Jammu and Kashmir after governor Satya Pal Malik stated that a foreign educated man will be the Mayor of Srinagar, even before the election process was over in the restive state.  Later he retracted saying television channel misrepresented his statement.
