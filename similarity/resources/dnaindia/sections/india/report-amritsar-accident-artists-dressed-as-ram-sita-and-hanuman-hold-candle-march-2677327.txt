Â Artists of the Shree Ramleela Committee on Saturday held a candle march in Chandigarh as a tribute to the victims of the Amritsar train tragedy that took place during Dussehra celebrations on Friday.
Dressed as Lord Ram, Goddess Sita, and Lord Hanuman, the artists walked on the streets accompanied by many sympathisers of the tragedy.
"We are holding this candle march to request the authorities to make strong guidelines for Ramlilas from next time onwards. Such type of incident has never happened in the past. We are really upset with what has happened in Amritsar. Hope, the government will take appropriate action," said Chakshu Puri, one of the artists.
As many as 59 people lost their lives and 57 others were injured after a local passenger train ran over a crowd watching Dussehra celebrations near Joda Phatak area in Choura Bazar on Friday evening.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved an ex-gratia payment of Rs. 2 lakh for the families of those killed in the train tragedy, along with Rs 50,000 for the injured.
Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased. He has also ordered a judicial inquiry into the matter.
