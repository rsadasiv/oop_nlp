The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) has asked affected villagers of proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) to not believe any rumours and to only consult with officers designated by CIDCO for any kind of details on rehabilitation. Prajakta Varma, joint managing director of CIDCO visited Ganeshpuri village on Saturday and interacted with villagers.
The CIDCO reiterated that the state government has offered best rehabilitation package to the project affected persons (PAP) of NMIA and they should not get carried away with rumours.
"We have designated officer to each of the 10 affected villages and they will provide all the details sought by villagers," said Varma.
Ashwani Patil, a designated officer for Ganeshpuri, was also present during the meeting and informed that out of 214 PAPs in Ganeshpuri village, 151 have already signed an agreement with the CIDCO, while 45 of them have also received land as compensation.
"We have already demolished 24 houses after the agreement," said Patil.
According to CIDCO, there is also a court case regarding some plots of Ganeshpuri village, and the state government has decided to depute its advocate general. "We are expecting a positive result soon," said Patil.
Meanwhile, the PAPs of NMIA can vacate their homes till November 7 as the CIDCO has extended the deadline. The extension has come after continuous demands from villagers.
CIDCO has also agreed to give the special incentive of Rs 500 per sq feet to the villagers who give their consent and allow to demolish their houses by November 7. More than 3,000 families in 10 villages fall in the core zone of the airport.
However, there is a very narrow chance that all the villagers will vacate their home by November 7 due to festival season. According to villagers, a further extension will be sought as Diwali is falling around the same time and it will not be possible for them to vacate their homes during the festival.
