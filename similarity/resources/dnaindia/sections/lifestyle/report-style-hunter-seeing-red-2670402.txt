Statement coats have been ruling the Spring Summer 2019 line-up with aplomb! Realised in the jewel-toned duchess satin in bold, bright red hues — these staples have been the mainstay on the Milanese runways. 
From Versace’s come-hither tailored take on it to Prada’s preppy cocoon shape to Salvatore Ferragamo’s masculine cut version. While Versace teamed it with a colour-blocked turtle neck jumper and tights, Mrs Prada accessorised hers with a studded beret. Ferragamo, on the other hand, layered theirs on a neutral shirt.
