Maximalism has been the key runway story over the last many seasons and this Fall-Winter, it’s all about the mega-wattage shimmer induced by fringes, tassels and chainmails. 
Labels like Gucci and Balmain have been the key catalysts in introducing pieces with statement-making sparkle on separates. Be it the chainmail dresses seen at Paco Rabanne or the mesh overlay at Christopher Kane — it’s hard to overlook the all-pervading 3D shine, which has also dazzled the high-street racks. We get experts to share their take on this phenomenon. Stylist Mohit Rai says, “The maximalist aesthetic will continue for another season, maybe with some military influence.”
Shine has been the key component of our core aesthetic and it’s hard to envision a festive closet minus embroideries. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Fashion Director, Vogue India observes that in India, we often take our embellishments for granted while internationally, it’s considered luxury. “An average person’s outfit here always has a bit of embroidery, but we don’t give it much importance. However, globally it’s seen as an expertise. Of course, its placement and amount may vary depending on the label, for example, they may use just one stone, but in different sizes.” 
A section of stylists feel that these visually-arresting pieces don’t really translate into everyday style. Stylist Divyak D’Souza says, “This kind of fashion has a place on the runway and at the Met Gala, but doesn’t fit into everyday life of people.”
