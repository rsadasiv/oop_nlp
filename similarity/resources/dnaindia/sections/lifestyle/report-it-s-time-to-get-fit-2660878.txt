According to researchers from the World Health Organisation (WHO), lack of exercise will soon make one in four people across the world prone to cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and some cancers, too.
In 2016, around 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries (1.9 million people) showed that around 32 per cent women and 23 per cent men were not doing recommended levels of physical activity — 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity per week. 
The bad news for Indians is that at least 44 per cent women reported insufficient activity compared to 25 per cent men, which is a grave concern. Experts suggest how you can get your minimum quota of physical activity per week.
For professionals, long working hours, tiring commute and household responsibilities take up most of their existence, which means fitness is put on the back burner. For such individuals, Leena Mogre, fitness expert and Director, Leena Mogre’s Fitness, recommends beginning with 30 minutes of brisk walking (not just walking), five days a week. Also, do a warm-up before and cool down post your walk.
Gradually, you can increase it to 45 minutes to an hour. After a few weeks, add variety by doing a combination of jogging and brisk walk. After your body gets used to this, try running. Mogre adds, “Once your body gets used to this in a month’s time, it’s time to push your body further by doing strength training by doing light weights at home (buy dumbbells for home use). Also, resistance bands are great especially, when you’re travelling. Later, you can take up high intensity activities like kickboxing, circuit training, spinning classes, etc.” CrossFit is for those with advanced fitness levels. 
If gymming isn’t your thing, why not give dancing a shot? Shalini Bhargava, fitness expert and director, JG’s Fitness Centre, teaches dance fitness through Bollywood Fitness, Masala Bhangra, Zumba and Bokwa. “Dance fitness is popular, especially with women, who get bored of working out at gym. It’s also a great way for beginners to start getting fit. It serves as a low to moderate intensity physical activity depending on the trainer, the moves and class,” she says. These dance classes are usually one-hour sessions, thrice a week, so once can easily fulfill their minimum quota of 150 minutes of physical activity per week.
Alternatively, Shalini also suggests brisk walking coupled with yoga and exercises at home by watching fitness DVDs and on YouTube. But don’t be content with just 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, that’s the minimum for normal inactive individuals. For those overweight and obese, a lot more vigorous physical activity needs to be done along with eating right.
For those who do not have time to go to the gym, fitness expert, Swapnil Hazare recommends beginners to climb stairs for 10 minutes as a cardio warm-up, and then proceed to a combination of squats, push-ups, lunges and plank variations for 10 minutes and then gradually increase the time, number of sets and intensity. Those who haven’t done squats before, can begin with wall squats, then free squats and for push-ups, begin with wall push-ups, then go on to knee push-ups and eventually full push-ups.
“When you’re starting off for the first time, you don’t have to start with 75 minutes per week, you reach there gradually in a few weeks. Then just don’t stick to the minimum 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, you have to go beyond that to challenge your body. Later, you can start doing burpees,” advises Swapnil.
