If the very idea of stretchy bottoms puts your sartorial nose out of its joint, have a look at the recently-concluded Paris Fashion Week, which revived the cycling shorts like never before. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel created a faux-yet-stunning beach in the Grand Palais lashed by the artfully-engineered undulating water waves as his girls frolicked on the sand in sporty shorts teamed with the label’s signature tweed blazers. 
Prada’s version came in jewel-toned satin and Mugler’s presented them in a colour-blocked style. They were also seen on the runways of labels like Zadig et Voltaire and Each x Other. Malini Banerji, Fashion Director, Elle India sees their resurgence as an extension of the athleisure trend, which has been around for the past so many seasons now. 
“The athleisure look was all about comfort, being cool and lending oneself a sense of identity along with ease. I see cycling shorts stemming from that idea. However, they’re tricky to pull off for sure and only complement a certain body type and don’t look flattering on everyone. Also, they don’t allow much styling experimentation,” says Malini.
