People’s approach to dating varies according to how they perceive things. While some are laid back and relaxed others are methodical in their approach. Katie Miller, a student and millennial recently created buzz online with her exit-survey for exes. Here’s why.
Katie’s exit form was shared on Twitter by a friend, who tweeted, “There’s this girl I know who sends an exit survey to every guy she casually and seriously dates.” The tweet went viral as many people labelled her a genius for coming up with the idea of an exit-survey for exes even lamenting why they had not thought of it. This is not the first time people have suggested approaching dating like an interview for a job you really want. However, it appears to be the first time someone actually thought of putting together an exit-survey to gather feedback on what went wrong rather than torture themselves mulling over it after being ghosted.
It’s a basic set of questions like:-
The survey ends on a positive note giving one a chance to express themselves by providing additional feedback ending it with ‘Katie can’t be alone forever!
We asked experts to weigh in on using an exit-survey to get closure when things go south in a romance and you are absolutely in the dark about why things did not work out. And both were unanimous about it not being a good idea. Here’s their take on it. Psychiatrist Dr Hemant Mittal says, “Ghosting is a cruel dating trend that millennials and others have had to contend with in recent times. However, a survey like the one above is not going to fix that. It doesn’t hold much value because it’s not standardised and relies on the truth as expressed by the other person.” 
Clinical psychologist Seema Hingorrany agrees and adds, “This type of a survey has no validation because an ex may have a biased point of view. If the person is emotionally conflicted there is a chance past baggage will be projected in his or her viewpoint. Also, anger if any will also reflect in the answers. Considering, break-ups tend to take a toll emotionally and physically on both sides, any kind of negative feedback can mentally affect a person and this can take a toll on the process of trying to find closure.” Instead, Seema suggests to approach a counsellor to help you figure what went wrong as only a trained professional has the expertise to guide you through an emotionally unsettling time.
