Are designers looking at nomad imagery while working on their moodboards? Be it Chanel’s top coats or Etro’s tribal prints or Stella McCartney’s chunky knits — designers seem to be penning folklore tales in their outing. Folklore is essentially a refined boho and that’s how the Western fashion world reinterprets the ethnic/gypsy look without being too literal and overboard. Think peasant frocks, smocked tunics, patch-worked maxis or anything suede. “Folklore is what would be country or prairie chic for fashion.
Eclectic prints, earthy palette, artisanal details along with a rich melange of exotic textiles such as crinkled silk, deep velvet and suede are regular details which are associated with the trend. Largely speaking, folklore was born out of the East European and Balkan dressing and it continues its heritage in the form of volume details, layered looks and embroideries,” says designer Aniket Satam.
With more people travelling, the gypsy folklore trend is back on point. It is easy to carry off for the modern global woman. It is also a trend that translates easily from day to night with the right accessories. Designer Saaksha of label Saaksha & Kinni says, “For a toned down look, make the outfit itself the focal point and reduce accessories. Instead of heels, pair boots, and instead of statement jewellery opt for classic elegant pieces.”
