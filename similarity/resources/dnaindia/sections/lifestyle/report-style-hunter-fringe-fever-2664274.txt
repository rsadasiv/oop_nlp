Statement-making fringes and tassels were out in full swing at the recently concluded New York Fashion Week. From Norma Kamali’s tiered fringed twin sets to tassels accenting Anna Sui’s printed dress to Tom Ford’s high-voltage evening take on it. Gloss-heavy outings by Cushnie and Prabal Gurung saw a flurry of tiered fringed party dress which will be the red carpet favourites in weeks to come. Raf Simon’s Jaws-meet-The-Graduate-inspired line at CALVIN KLEIN 205W39NYC extrapolated fringes to wreak an artisanal assault. On the other hand, Oscar de la Renta presented floor-length tassels that had a luxe-nomadic spin.
