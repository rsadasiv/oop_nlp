Looks like Bernard Arnault Chairman and CEO of LVMH had a clear-cut strategy chalked-out, when he got Hedi Slimane on board to run the creative direction of Celine, after its beloved designer Phoebe Philo left the house in December. Given Hedi’s stellar performance at Saint Laurent, he is expected to double the revenues, of around €800m. The new Celine’s (minus the accent on the logo) offerings also include perfume, menswear and couture.
Also, the game plan is to counter rival Kering’s Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello. However, as Hedi’s post dark creatures — skinny boys and rebel girls strutted down the Celine runway in disco dresses and micro minis — the cyber-sphere was inundated with vitriolic reactions — both from critics and Phoebephiles, who were hurt by the death of everything the label represented to them. Fashion critic Jo Ellison in FT.com noted, “Slimane’s success has been defined by his skill in “wardrobing”. But the show was still a head-scratcher. Like, for example, why didn’t LVMH just give Slimane his own label?”
She went on to argue, “And, lastly, how relevant is Slimane’s design, two years after having been out of the picture? The world has seen a huge cultural shift in the interim and the politics of clothes have arguably changed. The Celine show seemed to celebrate a world preserved in aspic — super-skinny, teenage, and near exclusively white. I was hoping we might have moved on.”  
Fashion columnist of New York Times, Vanessa Friedman observed, “Despite an audience crammed with rock’s hipster elite, the lyrics that most came to mind were Mamma Mia! Here we go again.”
Not that anyone expected Hedi to embrace the smart, working woman’s grown-up, practical and wearable aesthetic — Celine under Phoebe stood for, but none of the house’s code were carried forward. There was an addition of a trench coat and the press release clarified, “The entire wardrobe worn by the male models is unisex, and therefore will also be available for women.” After Hrs gets fashion experts to share their take on the new change of guard...
Phoebe Philo’s core aesthetic can’t be summed up in box. It wasn’t just about being pared-down or minimal. It was a powerful design sensibility which appealed to the thinking women. Malini Banerji, Fashion Director, Elle India says, “There is still the old Celine customer out there and I’m afraid they’ve alienated her. Is it only about the 16-year-olds? There are still women who enjoy classic and beautiful clothes. Is it about feeding a man’s ego? This brand could be called anything. Why call it Celine? Hedi does bring in a rock n roll spirit, but it’s such a limited language.” In fact, a lot of pieces were brought back from Hedi’s archive from Dior Homme and Saint Laurent without any changes. “I am not sure where this conversation is heading anything and I don’t see any positivity,” adds Malini.
Slimane’s often been called a one-trick-pony and this single-minded vision was criticised across the board. However, some recalled the windfall he caused at Saint Laurent and felt we should wait and watch. Edward Lalrempuia, Fashion Director, Harper’s Bazaar says, “At Saint Laurent too, everyone questioned Hedi’s approach to design, but the business boomed. Now he’s competing with Saint Laurent and we need to see how the titans battle it out. I’m assuming LVMH wanted drastic rebranding. Having said that, I’d like to add that Hedi has a singular vision — he was the first to start the skinny trend at Dior Homme with rocker jeans. Now we have two places to shop party pieces — Saint Laurent and Celine.”
A section of fashion commentators also opined that we live in a different time when there’s a collective movement to empower women. Against this ‘woke’ backdrop, Hedi’s Saint Laurent and Dior Homme redux felt out of touch. Stylist Divyak Dsouza observes that clothes lacked polish. “The minute you thought of baggy yet bohemian, pragmatic yet chic, a minimalism which was comforting, you thought of Phoebe. However, Hedi’s models reminded me of a badly behaved party girl, who expects everyone to clean up after her. I think there was a snub to the age-less audience and club kids were the only focus. Also, the menswear didn’t appeal to me at all and the gender fluidity seemed like a gimmick. All in all, it felt early ’2000s and didn’t feel progressive. However, the critics and the front row crowd aren’t paying for these clothes.”
