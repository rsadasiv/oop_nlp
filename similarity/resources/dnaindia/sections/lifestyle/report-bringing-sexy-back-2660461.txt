In a scenario when words like dad-core and athleisure are thrown around without much thought, it was refreshing to see Tom Ford reigniting his runway with his unapologetic take on evening glam. Body-skimming pencil skirt flirted with risqué lingerie and their sheerness was offset by faux croc bombers.
Our very own Lakshmi Menon walked the ramp. Looks like the line was inspired by Tom’s all-time muse Carine Roitfeld, former editor of French Vogue whose personal uniform has always been a tight body-con skirt teamed with a soft camisole and a jacket. The menswear stood out thanks to tone on tone layering and super glossy evening pieces.
