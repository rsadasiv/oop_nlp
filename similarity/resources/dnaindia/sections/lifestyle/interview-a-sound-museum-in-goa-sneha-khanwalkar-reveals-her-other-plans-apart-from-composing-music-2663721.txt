Sneha Khanwalkar’s music has been called many things — rustic, earthy and quirky, being a few of them. But the music composer herself doesn’t like to attach any adjectives to her art. “I don’t think I can lie too much in my music,” says the musician, best known for her compositions in Gangs of Wasseypur. One of the few women composers in the industry, Sneha says she allows all sorts of instruments and reflections in her songs. “I say no to nothing. I don’t have an opinion whether this kind of style is good or not. I think music is too big a concept to call opinions out of. I just want to have fun with it,” she adds. Up next, she has Manto, but Sneha has some other plans up her sleeve as well. Excerpts from a conversation...
The song stands for something peculiar in the film. The track itself is really groovy and we have used banjo, mandolin and violin to bring out the period. The sound is new, but the attitude is from a haunting, older time. 
Yes, we would search for poetry together. That’s how she chanced upon a couple of poets that she gave me as an option. Then I would think of the tune, and then call her and tell her, this is how it sounds in my head. We were both looking for a haunting quality. She wanted to explore new sounds without using too much electronic music.
I don’t work from the point of view of just doing a lot of films. Also, I was taking time off to figure out whether I’m doing stuff to please myself or to please others. I don’t have the aspirations of emerging as the most daravana (scary) music director! (laughs) I run my kitchen pretty well. I travel a lot around the world and exchange notes with many artistic people. And I will always be this way. I was doing a few art residencies too. Also, tindering. 
Yes, of course, what else would I do? Look back at an IMDB page? (laughs) On a serious note, there are phases where I feel like doing a lot of work and there was that phase in 2012. I did two films and Sound Trippin that year. And then for some time, I didn’t want to do anything. And now again, I feel like doing a lot for the next two-three years. Maybe, I’ll do a lot of work and again go back to not doing much.
I’m starting two other films. I’m also building a sound museum in Goa. It’s going to be a temporary one for the time being. Let’s just say, I have been reading up a lot on different musicians. The sound museum should come up in December, so you will just have to wait and watch.
