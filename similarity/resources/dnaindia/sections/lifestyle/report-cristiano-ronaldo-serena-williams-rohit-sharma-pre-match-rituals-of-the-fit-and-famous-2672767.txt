Have you ever wondered what goes on in the mind of some sports personalities as they prepare for their matches? How do they bring about their A game? Well, besides tonnes of practice and strategising, some of them are in the habit of doing what can be termed as “pre-game rituals”, and some of them are quite quirky. Recently, it was revealed that footballer Cristiano Ronaldo stands buck naked in front of the mirror and admires himself before every match. Though it might be termed narcissistic, it apparently helps him feel as if he’s a cut above the rest and perform better for his team. Want to know what your other sports heroes do? Read on...
Recently, the 23 Grand Slam singles titles winner has been in the news for calling out sexism in tennis. But here’s something interesting that many might not know about her pre-game ritual. Serena washes her hands thoroughly before every match. Well, this isn’t just a superstitious tradition she follows. “To make sure that they’re nice and dry so I can grip that racquet tight enough,” she explained. Also, the tennis star walks on to the court listening to Flashdance What A Feeling by Irene Cara to rev up her spirits.
The 26-year-old is a family guy indeed, and his number one thing on the list is talking to his daddy dearest. Hearing his father’s voice gives him strength. “I always call my father, to talk before the game,” he says. Since Neymar Jr is also a religious guy; a prayer is a must for him. Last but not the least, the Brazilian and Paris Saint-Germain FC hero posts a picture on social media for his fans before the game.
The handsome Spanish midfielder, who also plays for Chelsea FC, kisses his ring gifted by his wife four times before he gets on the pitch, as he believes it brings him good luck. “I’m not superstitious at all but there is one thing that I started doing four years ago — it went well and I didn’t stop doing it. I kiss this ring that my wife gave me four times — my lucky number — and then I leave it in my locker and I go out,” he has revealed.
The Spanish tennis star takes the cake when it comes to being superstitious. Nadal is known for various precise, complicated routines before and during the game. In his autobiography, Rafa: My Story revealed that he has a cold shower 45 minutes before heading to the court. “Freezing cold water. I do this before every match. It’s the point before the point of no return. Under the cold shower, I enter a new space in which I feel my power and resilience grow,” he said. 
The 17 Grand Slam singles titles winner also places his water bottles in a specific manner on the court. He has said, “I put the two bottles down at my feet, in front of my chair to my left, one neatly behind the other, diagonally aimed at the court.” He continues, “If it were superstition, why would I keep doing the same thing over and over whether I win or lose? It’s a way of placing myself in a match, ordering my surroundings to match the order I seek in my head.”
Besides playing for team India, the right-handed batsman is also the captain of the Mumbai Indians team in the IPL. One of Rohit’s pre-game rituals involves having a cup of joe and talking to his wife before heading to play. Now comes the quirky part — while entering the pitch, the 31-year-old puts his right foot on the field first.
