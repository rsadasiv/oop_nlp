The 10th season of MasterChef Australia has kicked off on Star World and the show, which has changed the way the culinary world is looked upon, has an exciting line-up of things to look forward to. Taking the much-loved show's legacy forward in India, the channel celebrated #10YearsofGourmet with Chef Saransh Goila of Goila Butter Chicken, by hosting an event at Kode in Mumbai.
The highlight of the evening was the showcasing of the ten most iconic dishes from the MasterChef kitchen over these ten years, as well as a delicious Italian meal specially curated for the guests. Some of the dishes included Texture of Parmesan, Duo of Asparagus soup, Camembert and black garlic with edamame quiche and caviar, Lamb cutlets with eggplant puree & minted iceberg served with fresh mint oil, Risotto with braised mushroom & hazelnut and parsley among others. Just like the show, the evening also saw some fun challenges for the guests, including a Mystery Box challenge where the guests had to guess the names of five different types of cheese. The second challenge was to guess the dessert served at the end, and that too, blindfolded!
But before that, Saransh, who happens to be the first Indian chef to judge an elimination challenge on the show, shared his experience of the shoot. “When Matt Preston talks about food, he talks like a poet. I thought I knew about Hyderabadi Biryani, but when he spoke about it to me, I wanted to have it right there and then!” he said with a laugh. He spoke about judge Gary Mehigan's observation about the change he's seen over the years in the show. “He observed that when the show started, contestants would take pasta out of packets and use ready-made dimsum roll sheets. Now, they make it all fresh and from scratch!” said Saransh, who made the contestants cook his famous Goila Butter Chicken with roomali roti, chutney and sirke wale pyaaz on the show. Now, we think that's enough reason to get cracking on MasterChef Australia!
