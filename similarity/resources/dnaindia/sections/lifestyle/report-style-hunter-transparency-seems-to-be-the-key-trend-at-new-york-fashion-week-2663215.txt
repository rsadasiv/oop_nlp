The recently-concluded New York Fashion Week saw designers sending out diaphanous creations which injected a tinge of sensuality to their offerings. Christian Cowan sent out a sheer gown with hoodie detailing which exposed the breasts and Christian Siriano sent out men in transparent and printed onesies. Jonathan Simkhai’s prairie-like dresses had a play of transparent tulle and lace, Presley Gerber was seen rocking an embellished translucent shirt at Prabal Gurung’s runway. Labels like Boss, Rodarte and Self-Portrait too sent out ensembles with sheer accents. 
Malini Banerji, Elle India’s Fashion Director says, “My personal favourite was Rodarte, which made a remarkable comeback to New York. It was feminine, girly and there’s something about making women feel pretty and special using tulle and a sentiment of lightness, which can be achieved with transparency.” Sheer fabrics and designs have been the key runway story since 2017 and their popularity has reached its peak with this season. 
“The constant appearance of this trend highlights body positivity, confidence and feminine strength. Women and men are both investing in crafting the desired body ideal and celebrating their anatomy with planned lifestyles, which in return they celebrate by sporting translucent and sheer designs. From a stylist perspective, they make for a great layering piece, which adds to an interesting overlay to your mundane basics. What interestingly has emerged this season are the printed sheers which when layered with contrasting pieces will give a different effect every time it’s teamed differently. My personal favourite would be the sheer animal skin body-hugging silhouettes, we saw at Christian Siriano as it almost screamed second skin,” says Aniket Satam, designer and guest faculty, Istituto Marangoni.
