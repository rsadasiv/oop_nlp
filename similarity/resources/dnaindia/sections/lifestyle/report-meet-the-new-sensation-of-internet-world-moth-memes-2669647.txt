Moths have taken over meme world and there is no stopping. The winged creatures are the new obsession of the meme universe and there are various versions of them popping up on social media platforms.
According to BBC, first moth meme was generated in July this year when a Reddit user posted a close up of a moth on their window. Capitalising on these insects love for lamps, another user tried out a line, "Hey buddy you have any LAMPS?!"
Currently there more than 6000 images on Instagram with #mothmemes that also include repurposed 'distracted boyfriend' meme in which the moth cannot stop looking at a lamp. One meme is about the moth turning a French citizen after learning about Paris' nickname of City of Lights. The moth has also replaced rapper Drake in memes.
Here are some examples -

Moths' attraction towards light is reportedly explained by a theory that suggests they use the light of the moon to navigate in the night and bright artificial light confuses them. Another theory suggests that male moths confuse the candle flames with a female moth's sex hormones.
Whatever be the real reason, moths are having their moments under the spotlight. You either laugh along or wait for the trend to die down. Psst, hit the mute button if this not your cup of tea.
