It’s been a season of shimmery brocade, jewel-toned chanderis and recycled polymer fabrics hinting at a celebration-focused closet, which can be worked from day to night with a few tweaks here and there. Be it Arpita Mehta’s tropical wedding bling-meets-print offerings or Abraham & Thakore’s gold and black brocade saris or Pankaj and Nidhi’s appliquéd separates. Nachiket Barve’s millennial maharanis have a penchant for floor-length gold embroidered jacket and Payal Singhal’s rose gold separates had tone-on-tone floral embroideries. We get experts to analyse this soiree-focused wardrobe... 
If Arpita Mehta’s fun bridal separates brought to mind a summer wedding, Nachiket’s pairing of embroidered jackets with tulle pocketed lehengas married comfort with elegance. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Fashion Director, Vogue India says, “There’s a move towards a more dressed up runway. One saw a lot of starburst and sparkle on day wear. The party pieces had a tropical day feel, like seen at Arpita’s collection. Nachiket’s blazers teamed with tulle skirts work for a fun bride. Shweta Kapur’s green trench with black sparkle on it was a new take on embellishments.”
Azmina Rahimtoola, owner, Atosa seconds that. “Arpita’s offering is the answer to young brides and their entourage of bridesmaids. It’s something which the young millennial girls would wear at a destination wedding. Abraham & Thakore wove brocade into suits and classic pieces — which are worth investing in,” says she.

Stylist Divyak D’Souza sees the treatment of shine as rather dramatic. “Shiny effect was executed in different ways, for example, Kallol Dutta’s shine was different mimicking a treated foil. I liked his tent-like kurtas and cargo pants,” says Divyak.
Some of the menswear pieces with shine had a wearable appeal to them, Amit Aggarwal being a case in point. Stylist Mohit Rai says, “Amit’s take on shine was amazing. It’s masculine and well-cut — something a man with a classic sensibility would wear.”
