I think my cousin is gay. Actually I’m pretty sure he is. He hides it from me and the entire family. But I’m so close to him. I wonder why he hides it from me. Can you please suggest what I can do to let him know I’m absolutely supportive of him? How can I help him come out of the closet?
Namaskar! It is really heart-warming to see you so supportive of your cousin. You seem like a very sweet cousin. I wish you were my cousin too. Not to say I don’t have sweet cousins, but this is next level sweet!
Having said that, what makes you so sure he’s gay? Maybe you could take him into confidence and let him know that he can share whatever he wants with you and eventually ask him whether he’s gay. If he confides in you, well and good.
If you think that it’s bothering him and his personal as well as professional life, you could speak to a counsellor and probably fix an appointment with your cousin as well. 
It’s better to consult a professional first rather than cause permanent damage to a beautiful relationship. Once he’s out of the closet (if he’s gay, that is), I’m sure you will be by his side and support him with whatever he chooses to do.
