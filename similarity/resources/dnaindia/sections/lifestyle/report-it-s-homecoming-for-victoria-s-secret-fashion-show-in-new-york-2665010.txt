The lingerie giant will stage its 2018 Fashion Show in the Big Apple this winter, as reported by WWD.
The brand took to Instagram to share the news with its 61 million followers, by sharing a series of posts featuring its famous ‘Angels' Josephine Skriver, Elsa Hosk and Sara Sampaio out and about in the city. "Start spreading the news..." the company captured the images. "The #VSFashionShow is back in New York City!"

The move signals a return to home turf for the US brand, which has staged its past two productions in Paris and Shanghai.
The 2018 show will welcome 18 new faces to its catwalk, among them Canadian model Winnie Harlow and Australian star Duckie Thot, who will take to the runway alongside a slew of the label's returning stars such as Georgia Fowler, Sui He and Grace Bol.
The annual show takes place in November and usually features some of the world's most famous supermodels as well as a stellar line up of musicians, although a date has yet to be publicly confirmed for the 2018 event. Last year's edition in Shanghai starred Bella Hadid, Alessandra Ambrosio and Adriana Lima, and included live music from Miguel, Leslie Odom Jr. and Harry Styles.
