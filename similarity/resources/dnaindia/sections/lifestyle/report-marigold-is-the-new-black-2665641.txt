Bright, happy and vibrant — marigold yellow was the clear winner at the recently-concluded New York Fashion Week — seen on the runways of Boss, Brandon Maxwell, Carolina Herrera, Escada, Monse, Oscar de la Renta and Pyer Moss. Wes Gordon, creative director at Herrera, sent out a floor-sweeping off-shoulder number in jewel-tone, which is likely to scorch the red carpet in coming months. The nomad vibe at Oscar de la Renta’s outing came alive, thanks to three pieces in this saturated hue — a halter dress and two off-shoulder dresses. Malini Banerji, Fashion Director, Elle India sees shine as a way of celebrations. “It’s a cheerful hue that welcomes Spring Summer in style — quite a departure from Fall’s deeper tones. It reminds you of the sun, the outdoors and is also considered auspicious back home,” she says.
For Indian festivities, this colour has always been the mainstay. Designer Aniket Satam says, “Last season’s butterscotch has gone deeper and reinvented itself in the form of warm marigold shade. It has an ethnic intensity.  This particular hue could prove to be an instant hit amongst regional markets.”
This hue has a strong festive appeal, too. Stylist Prayag Menon also roots for the luscious colour. “It’s a gorgeous colour that instantly brightens a look; I do think it will turn out to be major trend for Spring. I’d pair marigold yellow with deeper shades of khaki or with dark brown suede to create a balanced/put together look,” he says.
