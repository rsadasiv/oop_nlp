The government is likely to appoint a new chief economic advisor (CEA) in the next one or two months, sources said.
A search committee appointed by the finance ministry is expected to finalise the list of suitable candidates soon and appointment is likely in 1-2 months, they said further.
The government on June 30 invited applications for the appointment of CEA on deputation basis after Arvind Subramanian quit the office ahead of completion of his term.
The finance ministry has appointed a search committee headed by former Reserve Bank of India governor Bimal Jalan to shortlist candidates for the post. Economic affairs secretary Subhash C Garg and B P Sharma, secretary, department of personnel training are also members of the selection panel.
Subramanian was appointed as CEA on October 16, 2014, for a 3-year term and was given an extension last year. His official contract was till May 2019.
Subramanian is currently a visiting lecturer of public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Â 
On a day Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian announced to step down on June 20, RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch had said the next economic consultant should be one who believes in Indian ethos and values, and is not obsessed with FDI or is on sabbatical.
The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) alleged that Subramanian lacked an understanding of the country and "ignored" farmers.
"Subramanian lacked knowledge about India, he was obsessed with only Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and ignored the most important aspect of our economy -- agriculture and farmers," SJM co-convener Ashwani Mahajan had said.
"Like former vice-chairman of Niti Aayog Arvind Panagariya, he was also speaking the language of 'Washington Consensus'. His agenda and purpose was not clear," said Mahajan, who has been critical of Subramanian on various policies.
