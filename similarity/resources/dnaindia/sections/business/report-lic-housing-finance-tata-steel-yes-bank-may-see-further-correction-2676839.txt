The bearish momentum of Wednesday is expected to continue in today’s session too. We may see a fall towards 10350 – 10320 in Nifty.
We may see further correction in stocks such as LIC Housing Finance, Tata Steel and YES Bank. Stocks such as ITC, NIIT Tech and Exide Industirs are likely to do well in upcoming days.
Auto, realty and private banking space may remain in red in coming days too. On the other hand, one should look for buying opportunities in Pharma counters on dips.
This is a sell on rally market and we continue to maintain our negative stance on Nifty for the target of 10200 – 10150.
Sharp correction in NBFC and auto space dragged the benchmark indices lower.
