With a rare decrease in fuel prices, citizens on Thursday received some respite from skyrocketing rates of petrol and diesel. The prices of petrol and diesel were decreased by Rs 0.21 and Rs 0.11 respectively.
With the rare dip in the fuel prices, petrol and diesel prices are now sold at Rs 82.62/ litre and Rs 75.58/ litre in Delhi. In Mumbai, the prices of petrol and diesel have come down to Rs 88.08/litre and Rs 79.24/ litre. 
A continuous hike in the fuel prices has been witnessed across the nation from past few months.
While the Opposition has repeatedly blamed the Centre for the steep hike in the fuel price, the latter has maintained that global crude oil prices and other international factors are responsible for the increase in prices of petroleum products.
This is the first fall in fuel prices following Centre's October 4 decision to slash the prices by Rs 2.50 by reducing the excise duty and announcing subsidy. The Centre had also even asked the state government to cut taxes on fuel to bring down the prices. The central government's decision was backed by several states, which reduced local sales tax or the VAT.
While the revision in prices was implemented in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam, Jharkhand and Goa, a number of states are yet to implement the decision.
Delhi government also refused to slash prices further saying it is among the states with the lowest rate of VAT on fuel. 
The Delhi Petrol Dealers Association (DPDA) has announced a one-day strike on October 22, after the state government refused to reduce the VAT. 
All the petrol pumps will remain closed in the national capital from 6 am onwards on October 22 and till 5 am on October 23.
