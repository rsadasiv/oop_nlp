Recently, Bharti Airtel announced massive network roll-out plans for Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand with the aim of enhancing customer experience as well as expanding high speed data and voice services to deep rural pockets.
As a part of its network expansion program – Project LEAP, during FY 19 Airtel plans to deploy more than 17,313 new mobile sites along with 6,650KMs of fresh optic fiber across the two states.
The deployment will create significant high speed data and voice capacity within the network to serve the explosive surge in mobile usage, driven by affordable smartphones and tariffs. Customers will be able to enjoy superior network coverage – indoor and outdoor - thanks to deployment of cutting edge technology solutions. 
With a deployed base of 43,219 sites at the end of FY 17-18, this planned rollout would grow Airtel’s network in UP and Uttarakhand by 40 percent to 60,532 further enhancing the speeds and voice qualities. The addition of fresh optic fiber would extend Airtel’s fiber backbone in the two states to 26,800 KMs in the region, supporting the growth of high speed data services in the region.
