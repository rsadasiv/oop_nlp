Canadian start-up Kupol has joined forces with the 3D printing specialist Sculpteo to develop and manufacture a unique, ready-to-market cycle helmet promising improved levels of comfort and safety.

This 3D printed helmet has a proprietary three-layer protection system designed to absorb multidirectional impacts while ensuring optimal comfort and breathability. The helmet's "Kinetic Bumpers" absorb low-speed impacts while the "3D Kore" takes the brunt of larger hits, from all angles. Finally, over 100 sucker-shaped flexible "Oktopus" pods adjust to the wearer's specific head shape while also providing protection against quick rotational movements.
The project is currently the subject of a KickStarter campaign where it can be pre-ordered from CAD$199. It is available in six sizes and seven colors.
