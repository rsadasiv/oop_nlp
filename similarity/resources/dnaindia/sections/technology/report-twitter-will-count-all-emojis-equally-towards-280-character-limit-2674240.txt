 Now, irrespective of which modified emoji you use, it will be counted equally towards Twitter's total character limit of 280. Previously, Twitter would count modified emoji, based on gender and skin tone, as higher in characters than the default ones. 
Now, as part of its latest update, Twitter announced through its developer forum that it will count all emoji equally, including the ones with gender and skin tone modifiers, leaving room for users to express more liberally. It was last year that Twitter increased its original character limit of 140 to 280 characters.
Twitter is killing the ability for its users to create Moments - a series of their favourite tweets in a story format - from their iOS or Android apps. The company made the announcement through its official Twitter Support handle, acknowledging the feature was not being used much by its users.
On October 23, 2018, the feature will be removed from the mobile apps. However, if you still want to create a Moment, you can head straight to twitter.com on desktop to create and share it.
When Twitter announced its Lite app, one of the highlights of the trimmed version was the ability to soak in less of your data. The company is now introducing the feature to its main app. You will now be able to switch to a data-saving mode on your iOS or Android version of the Twitter app. As Twitter explains in its tweet, you will be able to reduce the data usage by switching on the data saver mode.
To get the feature, ensure that your app is up-to-date. Now, head to the Data Usage settings and turn on the mode. When enabled, the images will load in lower quality and the videos won't autoplay. You can choose to see a higher quality image by tapping on the more icon and selecting 'Load High Quality'.
