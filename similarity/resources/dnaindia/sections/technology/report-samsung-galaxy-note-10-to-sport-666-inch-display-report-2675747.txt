It is now believed that Samsung’s upcoming flagship device, the Galaxy Note 10, will come with a 6.66-inch display.
According to The Bell, Samsung Mobile handed the specifications over to Samsung Display so that the company can start work on the Super AMOLED panel.  The company has also given the code name "DaVinci" to the upcoming Galaxy Note 10 and has stated development on the same.
Recently, rumours suggested that Samsung may merge the Galaxy Note and Galaxy S series. This would result in lower production costs and also increase the profit margins.
Samsung was reportedly struggling to adjust its flagship model lineup to defeat profitability deterioration caused by the saturation of the smartphone market.
The Galaxy Note and the S Series are almost similar. The only difference between the two is the fact that the Note series offers an S Pen and a few other software features. The discussion that the two products should be unified into a single cost reduction has been raised inside the IM division.
The company is also said to have a modest sales goal for the Galaxy Note 9, aiming to ship a total of 12 million units. The reports points out that this move is to rather, retain existing customers, rather than win over new ones.
Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 9 in August this year. In India, the 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant is priced at Rs 67,900 while the 8GB RAM/512GB storage variant is priced at Rs 84,900.
