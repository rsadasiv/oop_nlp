Facebook has updated its policy for the News Feed where links from websites promoting stolen content will be demoted. The target for the social network is to push interesting stories to users over posts which are not relevant. According to Engadget, Facebook has updated its AI system to better detect websites which scrape content or republish articles from other sources, without correct attribution or making very little changes without permission.
Facebook explains that users will now be shown fewer posts with low-quality sites that predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without adding any unique value. 
British former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, a leading anti-Brexit advocate, said he would be starting a job at Facebook, as the US giant faces up to regulatory pressures. "I am delighted to be joining Facebook. After almost 20 years in European and British politics, this is an exciting new adventure for me," Clegg wrote on his Facebook page. Clegg said Facebook was "at the heart of some of the most complex and difficult questions we face" such as "privacy of the individual", "integrity of our democratic process", and "the balance between free speech and prohibited content".
The Press Association news agency and the Financial Times said Clegg would be Facebook's new head of global affairs and communications and would move to California in January. The 51-year-old is also a former European Commission trade negotiator and member of the European Parliament. Clegg used to be head of the Liberal Democrats, a small opposition party, but was voted out of parliament in a 2017 election when the party suffered major setbacks.
The former politician has pushed for a second referendum that could stop Brexit but the proposal has been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. His most recent book is entitled: "How to Stop Brexit (And Make Britain Great Again".
