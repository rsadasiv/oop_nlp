Google is introducing some strict changes to its Play Store policy after facing a major USD 5 billion fine from the EU in an antitrust violation case. In a first, Google will charge Android phone makers a licensing fee who want to sell devices in Europe with pre-installed Google Play Store and other apps, Mashable reported.
While Play Store and other apps including Gmail and YouTube come under the new guidelines, Google Search or Chrome will remain available for free to the OEMs. However, Google Play Store will be allowed in devices running custom versions of Android. 
Recently, Google started rolling out a test version of Google Lens this week, giving the app the ability to analyze imported images, snapped images, live images, ALL images.
As predicted by 9to5Google, a new day of Google Lens dawned for some users, with the application supporting an expanded capability of image analysis.
In June of 2018, Google released its most advanced image recognition app to date in a standalone version available on Google Play. Now, a year after the initial rollout on the Pixel 2 in October 17, anyone can download the app, and the latest beta version is increasing its functionalities.
To summarize, Google Lens is an application that, previously, could only tell you about anything in your viewfinder. If you point your camera at a cat, the app will tell you it's a cat; if you are directing it at a bush of flowers, Lens could tell you that you're looking at hydrangea paniculata; basically, if you're looking at it and can take a picture of it, Google can help you figure out what exactly it is.
