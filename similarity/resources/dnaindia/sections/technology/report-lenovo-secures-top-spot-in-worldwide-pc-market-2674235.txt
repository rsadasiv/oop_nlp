Lenovo acquired a major chunk of the PC industry in the third quarter of 2018 as per latest estimates by both IDC and Gartner. orldwide PC shipments totaled 67.2 million units in the third quarter of 2018, where Lenovo secured 24 per cent of the global market share. Following close second is HP with close to 22 per cent share, followed by Dell at 17 per cent. 
According to Gartner, the PC shipments witnessed flat growth in the Q3, 2018. The firm noted that the shipments increased by 0.1 per cent y-o-y, while IDC noticed a slip of 0.9 per cent. However, in the US market alone, HP reigns the list with 30 percent market share with Dell and Lenovo following up at 25.9 per cent and 15 per cent. The top five companies in terms of Q3, 2018 market share are Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer Group, and Apple.

Lenovo's bending smartphone, which first made its appearance in concept form at the Lenovo Tech World Conference in 2016, is making its way back -- this time without cracking. The company shared a 10-second video captioned, "We are just so terribly good. It's time to show off. We'll see you in October," on their Weibo account, one of the most popular microblogging platforms in China. 
You can see the new and improved phone's ability to bend with the widgets adjusting in real-time to more appropriately display the content based on its new shape.
We've been waiting for more news about this innovative phone for two years and, according to the video caption, the phone is right around the corner -- maybe not yet for purchase, though. But will it be worth the hype? The company itself posted a video with unexplained dark spots along the right edge that appear to be due to wear and tear...but, then again, maybe they're intentional.
