In a bid to promote a healthier and safer environment for children on the internet, Google has kick-started new initiatives for parents to educate their children how to be safe online. Googlehas joined hands with the National PTA and DonorsChoose.org to create a workshop kit called ?Be Internet Awesome? for parents to teach one another on initiating discussions on digital safety and citizenship.
The kit includes a Pixelbook and presentations for co-learning at home about online reputation, social sharing, phishing scams, privacy, cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and such topics to promote a safer internet experience. Google will also be awarding grants worth USD 1,000 to local PTAs in every state in the US to help facilitate the workshops. 
Recently, Google's India-born chief executive Sundar Pichai quietly paid a visit to the Pentagon to ease tensions that erupted after employee outrage prompted the tech giant to sever a controversial defence contract to analyse drone video, according to a media report. 
Pichai met with a group of civilian and military leaders mostly from the office of the Under Secretary of Defence for Intelligence, the Defense Department directorate that oversees the artificial-intelligence drone system known as Project Maven, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the meeting, The Washington Post reported.
Google had worked with the Defense Department to develop Project Maven, which uses AI to automatically tag cars, buildings and other objects in videos recorded by drones flying over conflict zones. But in June, the tech giant said it would not renew its contract following an uprising from employees, who criticized the work as helping the military track and kill with greater efficiency, the report said.
