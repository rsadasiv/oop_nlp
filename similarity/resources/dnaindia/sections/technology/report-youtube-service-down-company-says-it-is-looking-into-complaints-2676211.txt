Google-owned video streaming website YouTube on Wednesday suffered a global outage with millions of YouTube users unable to access videos on the platform for nearly an hour. The users from across the globe took to social media to complain about the issue. 
In a tweet, YouTube acknowledged that its service was down and it was looking into the issue. 
"Thanks for your reports about YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music access issues. We're working on resolving this and will let you know once fixed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will keep you updated," it said. 
Over an hour later, the company tweeted that the service was back. 
"We're back! Thanks for all of your patience. If you continue to experience issues, please let us know," Team YouTube said in a tweet. 
As the popular streaming service with over one billion subscribers faced outage, social media users vented their anger on Twitter. Hashtag #YouTubeDOWN soon became the number one trend worldwide. 
Several users who were trying to access the video sharing platform on Wednesday morning complained of seeing '500 Internal Server Error' messages and '503 Network Error' messages popping up on their screens. Some users only saw a blank screen on the YouTube page. 
The global outage of YouTube comes a day after Twitter users, particularly iOS users, went into a frenzy for about an hour, when the app began streaming notifications in a cryptic series of alphanumeric characters. 
Another prominent social media platform, Facebook also faced a security breach a few days back.
One of Google's subsidiaries, Youtube was launched in 2005.
Currently, YouTube is one of the most visited websites on the internet.
