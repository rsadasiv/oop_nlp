One of the most gracious and beautiful actresses of all times, and a loving mother to her two daughter- Renee and Alisah, Sushmita Sen is a lady, several women look up to.
Sushmita, a single mother, was earlier dating Ritik Bhasin but had called quits with him a while back.
And now, according to reports the model-actress is dating Rohman Shawl, who too is a model. 
Sushmita met Rohman at a fashion event two months ago and hit off instantly. 
Recently, Rohman was seen cheering the actress at Neeta Lulla's fashion show, and was also seen interacting with Sushmita's kids. 
And, while the two have not confirmed their relationship, a source close to SpotBoye has said that Sushmita and Rohman are 'more than friends.' 
"It’s too early to comment on their relationship status but they are definitely more than just friends," said the source. 
The same report also states that Rohman gets along well with Sushmita's daughters- Renee and Alisah. And since they have just begun seeing each other, they are not making it official anytime soon.
Talking about Sushmita Sen's previous relationship, the actress was in love with a Ritik Bhasin. However, they ended their relationship last year but are still on good terms with each other.

On the professional front, Sushmita Sen has not signed any project yet. But, she is open to mark her comeback in Bollywood.
Earlier in an interview with India Today, she had said, "I have been looking at scripts again for the past one and a half year. I think I am ready to commit six months of my life to a film. But, just because I am ready, doesn't mean the perfect script is ready for me."
