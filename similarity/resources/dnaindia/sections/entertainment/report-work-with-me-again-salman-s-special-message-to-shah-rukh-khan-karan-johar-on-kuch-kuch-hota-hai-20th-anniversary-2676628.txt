As the 90s iconic film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai clocked 20 years, a special conference was organised by the film's director Karan Johar on Tuesday, which saw a deluge of stars from the Hindi film industry. 
Almost every cast and crew member, including Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji, who worked on the film was present at the event, making it a reunion to remember. 
Other celebrities who witnessed the special celebration included, Abhishek Bachchan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Varun Dhawan, Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter among others. 
However, one of the most important persons to have been a part of the film, Salman Khan was not present for the celebration, and obviously his absence was felt. 
Even the Bigg Boss 12 host couldn't join the celebrations, he made sure that he was part of the festivities. 
How? Well the Bharat actor recorded a heartfelt video for the cast and attendees of the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai anniversary party with a special message for King Khan, Shah Rukh Khan.
In the video shot on the sets of Bigg Boss 12, Salman recalled how he landed a role in Karan’s directorial debut. 
He then sent good wishes to cast and crew members of the film and suddenly broke into a special message for SRK requesting him to work with him someday soon. 
“I am happy to be a part of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and may this film be an inspiration to all the young filmmakers and directors,” Salman said.
Soon, while conveying a message to Shah Rukh and Karan, the actor said, “Shah Rukh, Love you, best of luck. And Karan, best of luck and keep on doing great work and someday yaar, work with me again.”
