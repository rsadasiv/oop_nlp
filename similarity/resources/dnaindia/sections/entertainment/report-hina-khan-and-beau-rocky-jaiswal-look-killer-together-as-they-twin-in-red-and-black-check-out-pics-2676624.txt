Hina Khan, the fashionista of the Hindi television industry, has not once failed to impress us with her fashion choices, and this time is no different.
Whether western or ethnic, Hina has left us speechless with her fashion outings and how!
The actress who is reprising the role of Komolika in Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2, was recently seen at the airport, twinning with her boyfriend Rocky and we must say she was looking stunning! 
Donning a black dress, with a colourful belt around her waist, paired with white sneakers and red sling bag, Hina looked absolutely gorgeous, while her boyfriend Rocky Jaiswal wore a black t-shirt teamed with a red leather jacket and black cargo pants. 
Just like his ladylove, Rocky opted for white sneakers to complete his airport outing.

Talking about his relationship with Hina, Rocky had earlier told India Today, "We met on the sets of Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai for the first time where I was the supervising producer and she was playing the lead role. That's how we met. As for what attracted me to her was her dedication to her work. I have seen a lot of actors, but she is one of the smartest of the lot."
He further added, "It is almost unreal if you find a person who's so honest all the time. She calls a spade a spade every single time. And that's the most important thing I love about her. Besides, she is the prettiest woman in the world."
