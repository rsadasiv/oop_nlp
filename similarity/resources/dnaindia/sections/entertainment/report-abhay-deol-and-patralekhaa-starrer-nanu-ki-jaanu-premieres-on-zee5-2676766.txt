India’s second largest digital video on demand platform ZEE5, has been consistently setting the audience expectations higher with digital premieres of latest films week on week. To fortify its content library further, ZEE5 is now set to digitally premiere Bollywood Abhay Deol and Patralekhaa starrer horror comedy Nanu Ki Jaanu on October 18, to enthrall audiences.
Written and directed by Faraz Haider, Nanu Ki Jaanu is a bizarre horror comedy. Couched in robust humor with Abhay Deol and Patralekhaa, it is a quirky film that has its moments of brilliance. The story is about a Delhi land mafia agent, Nanu (Abhay Deol) who faces problems in his personal and work life as an unwanted person occupies a new flat that he wants to usurp.
Manish Aggarwal, Business Head, ZEE5 India, said in a statement, “Our proposition of digital premieres has been phenomenally successful, as the past few films have shown us. Through the global digital premiere of Nanu Ki Jaanu and other famous titles in the pipeline, we endeavor to consistently offer our subscribers premium quality content. Such initiatives act as a catalyst to spur audiences towards the OTT space.”
