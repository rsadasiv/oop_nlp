With the season three premiere just around the corner, showrunners of Daredevil have released a brand new poster of the superhero.
The new poster only adds to the hype of season's arrival. This new poster shows Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, played by Charlie Cox, shed his iconic red costume and return to the black suit we have seen in the trailers and teasers so far. The tagline reads: "Let the Devil Out."
This is your warning that the next season will be a darker take on the story of this vigilante so far.

Talking about the costume, Charlie Cox told Collider, "“The thing with the costume has always been, for me, it sounds silly, but I really need to feel like, from a story point of view, it makes sense and it’s in keeping with the genre and the tone of the show.
"So the way we transitioned into the red costume at the end of season one, the thing that really sold it for me was the conversation Matt had with Father Lantom, where he says, ‘Sometimes it’s important for there to be a symbol to be feared by people.’ It keeps them in check, it allows them to remember why they behave in a moral way. That was the impetus for Matt to go and embrace this symbol, this iconic red suit."
Matt Murdock is done being a superhero. He will be returning to his roots as a vigilante. There will be no moral conflict this time as there will be no prisoners. Kingpin aka Wilson Fisk, played by Vincent D'Onofrio is out and about with a plan to take down Daredevil.
Season three of Daredevil arrives on Netflix on Friday 19.
