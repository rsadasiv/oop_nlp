Actor Keira Knightley says she has barred her daughter from watching Disney films Cinderella and The Little Mermaid.
During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the 33-year-old actor said she is not a fan of every Disney film.
Knightley said she has "banned" her three-year-old daughter, Edie Knightley Righton, from watching 1950 classic Cinderella because "she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her".
"Don't! Rescue yourself. Obviously!" she said.
"And this is the one that I'm quite annoyed about because I really like the film, but Little Mermaid (is banned, too). I mean, the songs are great, but do not give your voice up for a man. Hello! But the problem with The Little Mermaid is I love The Little Mermaid! That one's a little tricky but I'm keeping to it," she added.
Knightley, however, said Disney's Finding Dory is not banned and added that the film is "a big favourite in our house".
"Frozen is huge and 'Moana' is totally fine," she added.
Knightley will be next seen in Disney's The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, where she plays Sugar Plum Fairy.
