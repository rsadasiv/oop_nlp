Writer-producer who had earlier accused actor Alok Nath of rape and violence, on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the police against him. 
This comes just days after the sanskari babuji filed a civil defamation suit against the writer.
While speaking to ANI outside the Oshiwara police station, the writer-producer said, "I have lodged a complaint, which has been accepted by the police. The officials have been really helpful and the process went easy and smooth."
Oshiwara police have accepted my complaint, now the due process has to be followed. The defamation notice was served to me post office hours last night and my lawyers have worked over night. Right now they are in Dindoshi Court and are responding to it: Vinta Nanda #Metoo pic.twitter.com/saWFLaW5Zt
However, she further said that it wasn't easy to recount the whole event which took place almost two decades ago.
In the ongoing #MeToo movement, the writer had accused Alok Nath of rape and narrated her horrifying ordeal in a Facebook post. She was the writer and producer of tele serial Tara in the 90s, in which Alok Nath played a lead role.
In the wake of these allegations, the Indian Film and Television Directors' Association (IFTDA) also issued a notice to the veteran actor, seeking his stand on the rape allegations made against him.
The #MeToo movement started after actress Tanushree Dutta showed courage and named Nana Patekar as a sexual harasser. Tanushree alleged that the actor had misbehaved with her during the shooting of the 2008 film Horn Ok Pleasss 10 years ago.
After the actress came out and spoke about her ordeal, several other women stepped out and named their perpetrators and shared their horrific experiences.
