It's a wrap for Spider-Man: Far From Home.
Tom Holland, your latest web-slinger, made the announcement of his Instagram account and treated fans to two new images from the set of the movie.
Holland started the image by image account of the last day of shooting of the sequel of Spider-Man: Homecoming with the post that showed him walking in with a plain white t-shirt and stylish glasses on.
Walking into our last day like.... #spidermanfarfromhome

The second picture showed his Peter Parker aka Spider-Man hanging by a pole as a camera mounted on rig takes the shot.

In the third image, we can see Holland in the new and presumably improved Spider-Man costume. He is standing next to Zendaya who plays Michelle 'MJ' Jones in the movie.
THATS A WRAP #farfromhome

Shooting for Spider-Man: Far From Home started in the United Kingdom in July. The cast and crew also shot a few scenes in Venice in September. Then they touched home base in New York for the final phase of shooting.
This sort of globetrotting isn't the only reason why the movie is titled Spider-Man: Homecoming. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige told ComicBook.com, "We like (the title) of course because it ties into Homecoming, not just keeping that word going, which we like and we liked it more than Homecoming 2, but that notion of 'home' is a word that has dual meanings we'd like to continue with this (Marvel Cinematic Universe) version of Spider-Man. So, Far From Home has multiple meanings."
Spider-Man: Far From Home is set to release on July 5, 2019. Apart from Holland and Zendaya, the movie also stars Michael Keaton, Maris Tomei, Cobie Smulders, Samuel L Jackson, and Jake Gyllenhaal.
