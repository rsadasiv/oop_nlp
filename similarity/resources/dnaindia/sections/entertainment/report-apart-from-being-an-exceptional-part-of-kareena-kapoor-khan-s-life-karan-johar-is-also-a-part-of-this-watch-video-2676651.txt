For all those cine buffs who have grown up watching Karan Joha's films and have admired his work, it was a big day for them on Tuesday as the filmmaker's iconic film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai clocked 20 years. 
To mark the 20 years of the film, Karan conducted a special conference, which saw several Bollywood stars in attendance, apart from the cast and crew of the film, including Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji and Kajol. 
Not only did these stars make the evening wonderful, but even their testimonials stood out! 
From Janhvi Kapoor-Ishaan Khatter to Varun Dhawan, everyone wore a piece of their heart for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and it was endearing. 
However, Kareena Kapoor Khan's introduction for the man of the moment, Karan Johar was more than lovely. 
Bebo who turned heads at the red carpet in her black Balmain dress, killed it on the dais as well when she said, "Karan Johar is an exceptional part of my life and many many WhatsApp groups. He is my partner is crime. He is my go to person when I have to gossip about the industry." 
The actress also pulled the Takht director's leg during her address and said that he writes his own introduction which says that he is nothing short of best. 
But soon Bebo admitted that there truly is no one like him.

We were aware of the love and friendship Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karan Johar share, but the actress words prove that the bond the two is extra special.
