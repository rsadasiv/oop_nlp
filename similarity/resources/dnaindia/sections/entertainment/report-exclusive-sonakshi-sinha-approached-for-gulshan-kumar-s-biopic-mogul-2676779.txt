In the wake of the #MeToo movement, Bhushan Kumar’s Mogul (a biopic on his father Gulshan Kumar) had hit a roadblock. Aamir Khan, his co-producer, who was also set to act in the movie as the male lead, distanced himself from the project after allegations of sexual harassment against filmmaker Subhash Kapoor came to light. The Jolly LLB director was then ousted from the film. Even though the makers are yet to rope in a director to helm the project, they have zeroed in on one of the female leads.
Our source reveals, “Sonakshi Sinha has been approached for it. The film dates back to the ’70s and ’80s and the team was looking for a heroine, who could exude that retro vibe.” The Dabangg actress has given her nod verbally to the project. “It’s a small, but meaningful role. Sona will only need to shoot for a few days. When she heard the script, she liked it and told Bhushan that she would do it. But the modalities still need to be worked out,” adds the source. We reached out to T-Series that is producing the film, but they remained unavailable for comment till the time of going to press.
Mogul will have three female characters. The source tells us, “It will depict the entire life of the music mogul. Sonakshi will play one of his girlfriends before marriage. The film is being designed on the lines of Sanju, where several A-list actors made small appearances. But among the three girls, Sona will have the most prominent part.” The movie is likely to go on floors by the end of this year and is scheduled for a Christmas 2019 release.
