'Badhaai Ho' is Ayushmann Khurrana's second film this year after 'AndhaDhun'. While Sriram Raghavan's thriller is being called the best Bollywood film of 2018, it's Amit Ravindernath Sharma's light-hearted comedy that got a better opening at the box office. 
Despite releasing alongside Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra's big-budget 'Namaste England', 'Badhaai Ho' is off to a 'flying start'. 
Sharing the day one box office figures of Ayushmann's yet another off-beat comedy, film trade analyst Taran Adarsh wrote, “#BadhaaiHo takes a FLYING START… Gets the advantage of partial holiday… Expected to score over the weekend… Thu ₹ 7.29 cr. India biz.”

This is way better than what 'AndhaDhun' had collected on Day 1. The film could barely garner Rs 2.50 crore (approximately) on its opening day. 
Meera Iyer in her review for DNA gave 'Badhaai Ho' 3.5 stars out of 5. "Unlike most movies, wherein actors essaying parents have a limited screentime, Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao are in focus in this novel and progressive story. Moreover, their romantic moments have been captured interestingly too. The performances are first-rate. Gajraj leads, followed by a superlative Ayushmann. You wonder why Neena Gupta kept herself hidden for so long because she is a delight to watch. As for Surekha Sekhri, well, she is feisty and first-rate. Even Shardul as Gullar complements.As for Sanya, her Reene shows spunk and restraint in equal measure," she wrote.
