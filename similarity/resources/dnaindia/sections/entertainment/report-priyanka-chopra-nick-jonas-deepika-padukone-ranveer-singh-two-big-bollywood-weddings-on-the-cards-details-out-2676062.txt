Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have apparently picked their wedding date. The couple, who got engaged in July this year, will be tying the knot on December 2 in Jodhpur. But this isn’t the only big shaadi on the cards in B-Town. In November, it’s Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh who will walk down the aisle. While the wedding may be held between November 12 to 16, the nuptials are likely to take place on November 13. 
Unlike PC-Nick, DP-Ranveer’s wedding is speculated to be a destination wedding, with Lake Como, Italy, being the frontrunner for the big day.
