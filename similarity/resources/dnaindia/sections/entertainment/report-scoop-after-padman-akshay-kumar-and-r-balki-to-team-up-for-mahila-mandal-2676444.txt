After the acclaim and success garnered by their maiden collaboration, Pad Man, Akshay Kumar and R Balki are reportedly teaming up again. Like their first movie together, the second one, too, is likely to be a woman-centric subject. Says an industry source, “The film is being called Mahila Mandal. In keeping with its title, it revolves around women. Nonetheless, the role that Akshay plays is of immense significance.”
A while ago, speculations were rife that the superstar and the filmmaker were getting together again for a project inspired by the women scientists, who worked on India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan (2014). Our informer tells us that the idea has been narrated to Vidya Balan and Nimrat Kaur and they have apparently given their nod in principle. A couple of other actresses are also likely to be cast in pivotal parts.
Akshay essayed the role of Ranjit Katyal (a fictional character) in the film that was based on the 1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait.
A sequel of the 2013 film, Jolly LLB, the second instalment had tons of black humour that pointed out the flaws in the legal system.
The film emphasised on the need for proper sanitation and eradication of open defecation in tune with the government’s Swachh Bharat campaign. Akshay played the role of Keshav, whose wife Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar) leaves him because they don’t have a toilet in their house.
The movie was based on the short story ‘The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land’ in Twinkle Khanna’s book The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad, which was inspired by social activist Arunachalam Muruganantham, who invented low-cost sanitary pads in rural areas.
