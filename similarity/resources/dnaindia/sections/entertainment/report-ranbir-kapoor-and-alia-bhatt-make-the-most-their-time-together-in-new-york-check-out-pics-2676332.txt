Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, together are absolutely lovely and even though they do not speak much about each other on public platforms or are not spotted out much, there admiration for the other is palpable. 
Alia, who is juggling between two ambitious projects- Brahmastra and Kalank, flew down all the way to New York with her boyfriend when he needs her support. 
Ranbir's father Rishi Kapoor is undergoing a treatment in the foreign city for an unspecified disease. 
While the Sanju actor and his mother Neetu Kapoor, both are there to take care of Rishi Kapoor, Alia didn't hesitate before going herself and spend some quality time with her rumoured beau too. 
Earlier, Neetu shared a picture of her son on her Instagram handle and captioned it, "The Strength." 
How adorable is that!
And now, albeit Neetu didn't post a picture of Ranbir and Alia together, a fan spotted the lovebirds, strolling on the streets on New York City. 
Yes, you read that right! Dressed in casuals, the Brahmastra actors were walking on the streets with their backs towards the camera. 
Take a look at the picture!
If you are disheartened that you didn't get to see their faces, here's another picture of the lovely couple, looking right into the lens and posing for a picture after having a hectic day shopping! 
Can't wait to see more of the two together!
Meanwhile, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt will be sharing the screen space for the first time in Ayan Mukherji’s Brahmastra, which is being produced by Karan Johar and also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna and Mouni Roy.
