Salman Khan's ex girlfriend and former Bollywood actress Somy Ali, took to her Instagram and wrote a post supporting the ongoing #MeToo movement in the country. 
In a long message, Somy has praised actress Tanushree Dutta for kick starting the long due movement in India. 
The Pakistan-born actress also talked about how she was sexually harassed at the age of five and raped at the age of 14, and therefore, she understands what it takes for a woman to speak up.
Somy Ali wrote, “As a survivor of sexual abuse at the age of 5 and rape at 14, I would like to salute all those that have spoken up and plan on doing so. I know it is very difficult to do it because I have been there and it took me many years to be able to talk about it. It takes an immense amount of courage to share this with the world. It’s even harder when you tell those that are close to you and they are supposed to protect you, yet they do nothing. I have been there too and it hurts like hell. But I want these survivors to know it is truly liberating and completely worth it."
 
The actress further wrote, "There is nothing we can’t overcome with strength and courage. Keep smiling and keep fighting. It’s our time now!!! #metoo”
 
Somy Ali also shared two videos on her social media where she can be seen praising Tanushree for being a role model for women empowerment today. 
She posted, “A special thanks Tanushree Dutta for initiating the biggest movement in the history of South Asia”. 
 
In yet another video, she says, “No means no”.
 
Tanushree Dutta had earlier accused veteran actor Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her 10 years back on the sets of 2008 film Horn OK Pleasss. 
After the actor filed a defamation suit asking Tanushree to apologise, the actress too opened the case and lodged a complaint freshly requesting for an immediate arrest for Nana and the other two involved in the matter.
