Thugs of Hindostan actresses, Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh were at their festive best as both the divas were seen donning pink sarees during the recently-concluded Navratri festival.
Fatima attended an award ceremony and the young actress decided to go the desi route for the same by wearing a traditional handwoven pink saree by Bageecha Banaras. The saree was paired with a sleeveless blouse. Golden jhumkas and bindi rounded off Fatima's look.
