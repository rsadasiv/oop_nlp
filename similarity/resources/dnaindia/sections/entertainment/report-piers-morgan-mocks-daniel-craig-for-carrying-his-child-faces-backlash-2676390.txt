TV host Piers Morgan questioned Daniel Craig's masculinity after the James Bond star was photographed carrying his daughter in a baby carrier.
Mocking the Spectre actor, Morgan shared the said picture on Twitter with a caption: "Oh 007.. Not you as well?! #papoose #emasculatedBond."

The remark by the host was met with criticism on social media, which was led by Avengers: Infinity War star Chris Evans.
"You really have to be so uncertain of your own masculinity to concern yourself with how another man carries his child. Any man who wastes time quantifying masculinity is terrified on the inside," Evans wrote on the microblogging site in response to Morgan's tweet.

Several fathers from around the world joined the chorus and shared pictures with their babies.
Some of them gave the Good Morning Britain host the taste of his own medicine.
"Delighted to find out I am as unmanly as Daniel Craig," a user wrote, sharing his photo with his kid on his back as he sprawled on the floor clicking a picture.
A tweeple said, "There is nothing more masculine than a father taking an active role in nurturing and looking after his child.
"About time more in the media celebrated this, I mean aren't you right-wing oddballs always bleating on about lack of family values?" "My wife carried my son for 37 weeks. I proudly carried him around the block. #fatherhood #babywearingdad," another user tweeted.
Craig and his wife Rachel Weisz welcomed their first child last month.
The Bond actor already has a daughter Ella, 25, with actor Fiona Loudon. Weisz has 11-year-old son Henry Aronofsky with director Darren Aronofsky.
