MTV’s most awaited show Ace of Space starting today, is set to take the audience on a ride through all the drama, spice and masti. The list of contestants joining the show has already created a huge buzz around.
In the first episode of MTV Ace of Space, Varun Sood, who gained popularity through the shows Roadies X2 and Splitsvilla 9, expressed angst about his equation with actor Priyank Sharma, known for his stint in Bigg Boss 11 and his ex-girlfriend, Benafsha Soonawalla ditching him.
On being asked by the mastermind Vikas Gupta, about what went down between them after Benafsha’s exit from Bigg Boss 11, Varun Sood narrated his painful story. From loving her unconditionally to letting her go, Varun broke down revisiting his past. He lamented, “I had to let go off many shows because I wanted to be with her. I used to breathe her, I have stood outside her house crying and didn’t sleep for two months.” With things getting all emotional on day 1 of Ace of Space, it will be interesting to see what more can these contestants bring to the show.
To witness new bonds formed, broken hearts mended, secrets revealed and the ultimate fight for Space, tune-in to the first episode of Ace of Space, starting today at 6PM, only on MTV.
