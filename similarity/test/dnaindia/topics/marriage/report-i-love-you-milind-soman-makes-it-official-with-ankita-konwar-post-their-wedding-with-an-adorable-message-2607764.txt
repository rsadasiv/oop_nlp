Breaking the heart of all his female fans, model-turned-actor Milind Soman tied the knot with his long time girlfriend Ankita Konwar on Sunday. The marriage took place in the presence of close family members and friends in Alibaug. The two-day wedding celebrations had netizens glued to social media for the pictures from their Mehendi, Haldi, Sangeet and Wedding ceremonies.Â 
Now that Milind Soman is no more single, the triathlon winner took to his Instagram account to make it official with his newly-wed wife Ankita Konwar. Milind shared a picture of the two of them together from their wedding and wrote alongside, "To love forever and a new beginning everydayÂ  I love you @earthy_5"
While speculations of them dating each other have been doing the rounds for quite sometime, reportedly, the duo has been in a relationship for the past two years. Milind Soman has also been trolled and faced a lot of backlash on social media in the past for dating somebody almost 26 years younger to him, neither Milind nor Ankita ever responded to the backlash.Â 
This is the first time that Milind Soman has publicly expressed his love for Ankita, and that too after taking her to be his wife. IF that doesn't reinstate your belief in the idea of true love, then we don't know what will.Â 
If Milind Soman shared an adorable message for Ankita Konwar on social media, Ankita too wasn't far behind. She also took to her Instagram account and shared a beautiful image from their wedding ceremony. Milind Soman couldn't seems to get his eyes off her, as is evident in the picture. Ankita captioned the picture writing, "Love always finds itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s way #foreveryouandi"
To love forever and a new beginning everydayÂ  I love you @earthy_5

A Mumbai Mirror report suggested that Milind and Ankita got married in an intimate Maharashtrian ceremony. There were a few Assamese customs too that were performed by Ankita's parents (since she's from Assam). The tabloid also reports that about 30 guests had travelled to Alibaug to attend the marriage ceremony and the wedding mandap, that was erected outdoors, was decorated with Warli paintings, roses and marigold.Â
