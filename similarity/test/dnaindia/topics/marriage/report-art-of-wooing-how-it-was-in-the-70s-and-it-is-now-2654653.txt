Chanced meetings when fate would lend her magical hand so that young love may blossom, though rare, are quite awaited. Only its form may have changed with passing generations â€" from accidental run-ins to accidental right swipes (on Tinder).
Who would've thought that phone conversations over a period of six months, back in 1977 would lead to a seven year courtship and a 34-year-long marriage? Debra and Lawrence (pictured inset) didn't think so either. Working at a travel agency, Debra D'Souza made frequent phone calls to another agency in charge of booking travel tickets, where Lawrence Britto worked as a reservation and ticketing agent in the '70s. It was their work that caused them to speak on the phone at least three to four times a day for ticket bookings and confirming reservations.
"I fell in love with his voice," begins Debra, who admits to being warned about Lawrence's smooth talking ways beforehand. To engage in deeper conversation, Lawrence would often break up work talk with witty one liners to get a giggle from the other end of the telephone.
It only took six months of speaking on the phone for the couple to finally meet one serendipitous rainy day (September 2, 1977). "He purposely forgot his umbrella at work so that we could be snug under one umbrella on the way home," Debra asserts.
For Lawrence, six months was too long a period to wait. He made efforts through the office peon to gauge Debra's beauty and even dropped by to chat with her once, not revealing his identity, of course. When asked about the moment he knew he was in love, Lawrence says, "On day one when she answered the phone with her cute voice saying 'hello this is Debbie,' I was smitten!" That was the beginning for this nearly half-century-old love story to boom. Now in their 60s, the couple still celebrate their first unofficial meeting in the rain with flowers among other things.

It has been nearly 20 years since the dawn of the Internet and still many online relationships are fleeting. Ironically, the growing number of ways of meeting a person caused a higher rate of mistrust and paranoia. Yet, the Internet that supports anonymity, is still the main source of budding relationships today.
Before the Internet, one of the ways of seeing someone you fancied was to wait at the railway station for hours on end only to get a glimpse of the train timings the other would take. To those infatuated souls of yore, Kannada film actor Chakravarthy Reddy says, "Get a life."
Hoping to change this fleeting phenomenon into one that lasts a lifetime, Reddy says, "I read somewhere that nearly 40 per cent of online relationships end in marriage. So if this is working for almost half of the population then it (online dating) doesn't have to be only about hook-ups."
A part of the Internet dating generation for a while now, this 25-year old actor swears by it â€" but of course with a few rules. Strict no-no's for Reddy include just plain and simple "not being a creep" and when it comes to wooing a person online, that doesn't require much of an effort either. "There's nothing much you can do to impress someone online other than putting up a good display picture or open with a good line," he adds. Reddy has also had many conversations with people online that have lasted more than six months. However, the intentions and desired outcomes of the meet â€" whether it will culminate in just sex or a relationship â€" need to be made clear.
Let's only hope that the future generations don't forget the art of wooing one another, or else the hope of finding another romantic Shakespearean tale or a real life fairy tale like that of the Britto family will be lost forever.
