After the landmark judgement, starts the fight for other rights such as right to inheritance, surrogacy and marriage. The Additional Solicitor General said in Supreme Court that the court should confine itself to de-criminalizing gay sex and no other LGBTQ rights should be entertained.
Legal experts feel that this is a clear indication that the government plans to oppose every other right for the community, which could cover surrogacy, inheritance, adoption and marriage. The community will have to fight each of these separately.
"If it needs to be fought, we will fight it out," says Supreme Court lawyer and gay rights activist Aditya Bandopadhyay. "Recently the court had offered inheritance rights to heterosexual couples that live together. However, I believe no precedent will help the case gay rights." "We hope this will open doors for conversations on other issues concerning the community," adds Prasad Ramamurthy, senior journalist and LGBT rights activist.
Despite lack of clarity on the legal front, some leading corporate houses have taken the step towards ending discrimination. "Godrej adopted an equal rights policy some years ago," says said Parmesh Shahani, head of Godrej India Culture Lab. "The company has three pillars â€" non-discrimination, equal employment benefits including health insurance and creating a culture of inclusion. As per the policy, partners of LGBTQ employees reap the same benefits as those of heterosexuals."
Harshini Mehkala, who works with JLL, vouches for the changing trend. "I had a sex reaffirmation surgery a few years ago," says the executive officer of the global real estate firm's HR department, "I used to work in an NGO when the firm got in touch with me. My sexuality did not come in the way of me getting the job."
The company is now looking to bring in more changes. "Our company has always been open to LGBTQ professionals," Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head of JLL, "Internationally, they were one of the first ones to participate in the pride march in London. After today's decision, we will go all out to ensure that we can give best in terms of what is accepted in India and in global practice. We can make a policy for medical insurance and other things."
