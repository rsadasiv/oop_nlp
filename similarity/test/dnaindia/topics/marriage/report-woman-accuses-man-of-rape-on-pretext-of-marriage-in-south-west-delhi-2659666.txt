A woman who befriended a Muslim youth of Kashmir through a dating application accused him of allegedly raping her on the pretext of marriage in South West Delhi's Chattarpur area, on Wednesday. He also alleged that he was attempting to convert her into Islam as his family would not accept her because she belonged to other community.
The victim claimed that the accused is said to be posted with the Jammu and Kashmir police. Fed-up with the alleged torture by the accused, the victim had earlier tried to end her life, she claimed.
The incident was reported to South West Delhi's Vasant Kunj North police station one month ago. An FIR was registered but no action has been taken yet, the victim said.
DCP (South West) Devender Arya said that a team has been sent to Kashmir to trace the accused. "We are not sure whether the accused is employed with J&K police or not. The case is under investigation," said Arya.
In an interview with a national news channel, the woman claims that she met with Adil Hassan, a resident of Kashmir through a chatting social media app. Both exchanged their mobile numbers during chatting and got into a relationship later on.
