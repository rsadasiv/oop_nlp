SonamÂ Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's families have confirmed their wedding on 8th May and their wedding invites doing the rounds on the Internet reveal that there are going to be three wedding functions in two days.Â 
Preparations are in full swing but seems like Farah Khan might miss it. We have already told you that the talented choreographer is overseeing the dance performances at the sangeet night where Karan Johar will be dancing on the title track of Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, while Sonam's cousins are dancing to the hit tracks of her likeÂ Dheere Dheere, Abhi Toh Party Shuru Huyi Hai and Veere Di Wedding title track and Janhvi Kapoor is reportedly dancing to late Sridevi's hit numbers like Mere Haathon Mein. But just a week before the big night,Â Â Farah Khan has injured herself and will need bed rest and no work for next few days. She has been advised bed rest for a week.Â Farah Khan posted a picture of her leg in bandage. She also asked Rajkummar Rao to return the crutches and ankle brace. Remember,Â Rajkummar had hurt himself on the sets of Lip Sing Battle, a show hosted by Farah Khan.Â

According to TOI sources, "Farah had committed a time for the show and for the rehearsals. So, her hours got a little extended. She was rehearsing with some contestants till late on Monday night. It was in the wee hours of Tuesday when she was walking back to her van in a tired state when she injured her leg. She was immediately taken to a doctor and it turned out to be a fracture, following which she has now been advised bed rest and medication for a week, at least.â€
Sonam Kapoorâ€<sup>TM</sup>s wedding is one event for the year and celebrations begin on May 7th with mehendi in late afternoon. On May 8th, the couple will get married according to Hindu customs at Sonam Kapoor's aunt's bungalow which will be followed by a star-studded bash in the evening.Â
