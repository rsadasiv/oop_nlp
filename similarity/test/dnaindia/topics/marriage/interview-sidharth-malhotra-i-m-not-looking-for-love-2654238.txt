Like many B-Town actors, Sidharth Malhotra, too, doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t talk much about his love life. However, he admits that currently, he is single. In a candid chat, the actor tells us why he is staying out of the dating arena right now and the fickle friendships in Bollywood. Read on...
Professionally, I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have any regrets. I have never wanted to do the same thing. I have learnt something from every film. Yes, of course, the best is yet to come. Personally, too (pauses), thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s nothing. You canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t really call them regrets. Right now, I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have the luxury of choosing my personal life over my professional life. In this phase of my life, I have no time or space for it.
Yes, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m single. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not looking for love right now as well. I came to Mumbai with a dream. I need to do a lot of things to achieve my goals. I want to put all my energies in it.
Marriage is definitely not on the cards. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not a priority. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not thinking about settling down right now.Â Eventually, hopefully, I will. Maybe, before I turn 40! That means, I still have seven years in hand. My professional life has to take off first. I have to be in a place where Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m satisfied with it. Clearly, I am not at that stage yet.
Yes, there is pressure from the family. Like most other parents, they also want to see me settle down. But I know I can handle them and they, too, understand that work is my top priority. They might broach the topic sometimes, but they donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t push it, so Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m happy.
I cannot call them friends; they are all colleagues. To confuse both would be futile. To have any expectation of them would be wrong. Yes, of course, some of them do become close associations, but I have no opinion on how and what people deal with. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know anyone here whoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s my relative or family. I only know them through work.
