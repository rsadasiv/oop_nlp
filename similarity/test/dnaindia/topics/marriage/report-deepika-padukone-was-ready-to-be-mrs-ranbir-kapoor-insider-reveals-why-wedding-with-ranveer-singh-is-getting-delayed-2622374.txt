Bollywood has been abuzz with Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's impending marriage rumours since more than a year. Though the actors themselves never confirmed it, insiders had it that the couple would tie the knot by the end of 2018 in Switzerland. However, it now seems the wedding might get further delayed.¬†¬†
As per a recent report in Deccan Chronicle, 'DeepVeer' fans might have to wait a little longer to hear the wedding bells of the power couple because Deepika is rumoured to be getting cold-feet. While Ranveer is ready to say "I do", the actress is reportedly having commitment issues.¬†
‚ÄoeRanveer is completely committed to the relationship and wholeheartedly devoted to her. But Deepika fears her heart may be broken again and this time she won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able to take it,‚Äù a director friend of Deepika told the daily.
It's not a hidden fact that Deepika Padukone has earlier dated Ranbir Kapoor. Their break-up had had an adverse affect on DP's emotional health and while Ranbir has clearly moved on, Deepika hasn't really been able to make peace with her past. The actress is still reluctant to completely commit herself into a romantic relationship.
‚ÄoeShe was looking at a life ahead with Ranbir. She wanted marriage and babies and was even ready to give up her career to be Mrs Ranbir Kapoor. They broke up and Ranbir moved on,‚Äù a close friend told Deccan Chronicle.¬†
Earlier while speaking to a leading daily during the promotions of Tamasha, when Deepika was asked if she still loves Ranbir Kapoor, she had said, "Of course I do. I don't think that every feeling has to be broken down as I don't believe that emotions are unidimensional anyway. Feelings and emotions are very layered."
After this latest piece of information, we are sure the fans of the actors will believe the actors' wedding news only when the actors themselves confirm it and not "a source."
On the work front, Ranveer Singh is currently filming Gully Boy and has also signed up for Rohit Shetty's Simmba and Kabir Khan's '83. Deepika Padukone hasn't announced her next project yet.
