Arijit Singh needs no introduction today. The singer, who shot to fame with his songs in the film Aashiqui 2, especially Tum Hi Ho, is known for having sung back to back hits in a number of Bollywood films. In fact, any film album is considered to be incomplete if it doesn't have a song sung by the singer. Arijit celebrates his 31st birthday today. It comes as a surprise that not much is known about the personal life of the extremely popular singer. In fact, not many are aware that he has gone through a divorce after his first marriage and then got married to his childhood friend. 
* Arijit Singh got married to one of his co-contestants in a music show Koel Singh in the year 2013. His first marriage couldn't last for long and the duo got divorced in the same year (2013). There's no picture of the singer with his first wife that's available on social media and not much is known about his first marriage as well.
*Later, Arijit tied the knot to his childhood friend Koel Roy in the year 2014, following Bengali rituals. It was the second marriage for both of them. They reportedly got married on January 20, 2014 at Tarapeeth temple in West Bengal. 
*Arijit's second wife already had a daughter from her first marriage when she got hitched to Arijit. 
*The singer shared the news of his marriage with Koel Roy after quite a long time on social media along with a picture of them. 
*In one of his previous interviews, when Arijit was asked about his second wedding, he asked the reporter not to ask him questions related to his personal life. 
Arijit Singh was born in Murshidabad in West Bengal. His father is Punjabi while his mother is Bengali. His family is deeply rooted in music and he got the initial training in music from his mother who's not just well versed in singing but also in playing the tabla. 

Arijit Singh took part in the reality show Fame Gurukul in the year 2005 when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari convinced him to do so. He was initially hesitant to go for the auditions but when his guru persisted, he gave in and went for the same and the rest as they say is history.
