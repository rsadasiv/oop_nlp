The second season of Karan Johar's hit radio show, 'Calling Karan' is making our favourite Bollywood celebs open up on their personal lives like never before. And, Karan is ofcourse more than enjoying playing the role of an 'Agony Aunt'. After Ayushmann Khurrana, Diljit Dosanjh, John Abraham and Kareena Kapoor Khan, it was his close-friend and current favourite muse Ranbir Kapoor who called Karan.¬†
According to a report in Spotboye, the 'Sanju' actor asked the filmmaker, ‚ÄoeAgar ek relationship mein aap ek galti karte ho, aur phir dobara woh galti karte ho (if you make the same mistake in a relationship again and again), what is the right way to sort out that mistake?‚Äù
We don't know what mistake was RK exactly referring to but Karan clearly understood and here's what he said, ‚ÄoeThen you should exit that relationship. Because there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no way you can make two mistakes, one after the other, without realising that something is actually wrong, Ranbir. So, I am sure, you know what I am talking about?‚Äù
Ranbir has been in long, serious relationships with both Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif in the past and it could be in all possibilty that he was referring to those relationships, here.¬†
In another section where Karan was asking rapid fire questions to the actor, Ranbir threw a reverse question to him. He asked if he had any advice for his girlfriend. To this, Karan replied, ‚ÄoeThat you are the best husband in the world aur mene woh advice de diya hai, Ranbir!‚Äù
Now we donot need a genius to guess who is girlfriend is. He is dating Alia Bhatt and he had confirmed the same in an interview to GQ earlier this year.¬†
