The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to consider listing of a batch of petitions challenging the practices of polygamy and nikah halala.
The court considered the submissions of senior advocate V Shekhar that the petitions be listed before a five-judge Constitution bench for final adjudication. "We will look into it," the court said.
Nikah halala is a practice intended to curb the incidence of divorce. It requires a female divorcee to marry someone else, consummate the marriage and then get a divorce to remarry her previous husband.
Shekhar and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for one of the Delhi-based petitioners Sameena Begum, alleged that she was threatened and asked to withdraw her petition challenging 'nikah halala' and polygamy among Muslims.
The bench asked the government to respond.
