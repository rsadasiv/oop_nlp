From the time a couple gets married, there is always a probability of a divorce. A marriage can't be divorce-proof. Definitely one can work towards making it one. But, the big question is, how? Before coming to this answer, let's talk about some of the distorted thoughts that couples commonly adapt to in a marriage. Such thoughts certainly create hindrance to a relationship.
All relationships have a great start, but end up in the same place. A beautiful common past of love and passion doesn't guarantee the permanence of these feelings. The biggest fallacy most couples make is concentrating only on remaining married. This standalone goal cannot be achieved by itself. But striving towards feeling passionate, alive and free in one's marriage is what makes it work. It is an ideal marriage when one can be one's self. It is also healthy to expect problems in a relationship. And these problems are simply the indicators that some changes are needed. Once couples have the necessary tools and skills of how to become a team and solve problems together, everything can be dealt with effectively for life. It's just about the right approach.
After all the major cause of a divorce may be a marriage, but there are reasons galore for a marriage â€" the odds are one against many. All probability of a marriage winning hands down!!!!
