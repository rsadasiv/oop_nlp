Model-turned-actress-turned-nun Sofia Hayat has been grabbing the headlines for throwing her husband Vlad Stanescu out of her UK home after she got to know about him being a conman. She broke her marriage with him and in a long post on Instagram, shared that he had hidden his identity from her and falsely told her that he's an interior designer when in reality he was in huge debt. Furthermore, Sofia has accused Vlad of theft as well. Now, in a recent conversation with an entertainment portal, Sofia has shared that she has forgiven her estranged husband for his wrongdoings and wishes all the joys for him. 
A report on SpotboyE quoted Sofia as saying, "I forgive him for what he has done. My heart hurts. I am not a mean person and throwing someone out of my home is a horrible thing to do.”
On being quizzed if she's ready to take him back, Sofia told the portal, "I don't think so, not in the near future. He needs to grow-up a lot. His past karmic energy is too strong. Although I helped him heal, I guess it was not enough.  Sometimes you have to set a bird free so that it can learn to fly. I cannot take that risk of having me back in my life right now. I am concentrating on my healing. I truly wish him luck and abundance and joy.”
Sofia added, "A part of me will always love him but I cannot be with him.”
You said you were an interior designer who designed palaces...YOU LIED...infact..you were in debt..You said you loved me..YOU LIED..love does not lie or steal..I paid for our sacred Union..I paid for the bills and I paid for our food and clothes..and yet..you wanted to steal more...you wanted everything I had...I met you..you were working in a shop..but I did not care..I still loved you. Everybody warned me not to be with someone who had no home or money..but..I did not listen..I believed in love..but you proved me wrong. So I pushed you out of my home and my life... I have learnt a lesson..that I will never be with anyone again who is not my equal. Who does not give back....He who is honoured to stand by my side...will be my equal..will inspire..create..love and know no darkness. I allowed my light to shine through you..now you will stay in the darkness that you are. The devil came to me disguised with the face of an angel..and tried to rape me of all that I am..but the sacred Mother is the All and can see the wrong. My power is truth, love and the love for my creation..for all that is good comes from me. There is one creator..Mother..Mata..Sekhmet..Allah Maa..Mary..and one power...LOVE. Anything else..ceases to exist. Now.
