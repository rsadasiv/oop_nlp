Department of Social Justice and Empowerment of Rajasthan is organising the marriage of twelve girls abandoned by their parents at a very early age. The program is scheduled to be held at Mahila Sadan in the city on July 20.
The officials of the Social Welfare Department became the guardians of the abandoned girls and took care of them. After keeping the girls in the Childrenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Home till they were minors, they were shifted to Mahila Sadan, where their education was also completed. Now, the department has taken the responsibility to get the girls married and has found a bridegroom for each of them.
Director of the department, Dr Samit Sharma said that we are making efforts to keep these girls happy forever. He added that the department officials interviewed the bridegrooms and the marriage was fixed after the approval from the girls. All the rituals will be followed in the program where ministers and officers will welcome the guests from the bridesâ€<sup>TM</sup> side and would also do Kanyadan of the girls.
Deputy Director of the department Reena Sharma said that she is taking care of a girl from the day she was two days old and was found on the road. There will be a ritual of Mehandi and Mahila Sangeet in the Mahila Sadan on Thursday. In this marriage, the whole arrangement is being done with the help of Bhamashahs.
There are many officers in the department who are taking care of the girls as parents since childhood, hence, the Kanyadan will also be done by them. Even in the 21st century, people consider girls as a burden. This marriage will set an example for those people and can change their thinking.
