Mohammed Shami's troubles with his wife Hasin Jahan have been going on since several months now. The dust seems to have settled after many rounds of allegations and counter-allegations between the duo.
The cricketer is now in a space where he can afford to see the lighter side of the bitter feud. During a recent interview, Shami joked about how he would invite Jahan for his second marriage.
"I am in much trouble due to my first marriage. Do you think I am mad that I will marry another girl? Hasin has brought a lot of allegations about me in last few months and this is an addition to that. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good, then I will invite her to be present at my second marriage (laughing)," Shami was quoted as saying by¬†xtratime.
The pacer further added that he misses his daughter¬†Bebo (Airah). "Only I know that how much I miss my Bebo. If I return to Kolkata, the problems will grow more and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why I am not returning there. But that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mean that I have forgotten my little angel,‚Äù said Shami.
Meanwhile, Shami has not been passed fit for Thursday's Test match against Afghanistan and will be replaced by uncapped paceman Navdeep Saini, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Monday.
Shami last played for India against South Africa in January before being embroiled in a corruption scandal, which he was cleared of by the BCCI in March. The 28-year-old played four matches for the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League earlier this year.
"The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named Navdeep Saini as Mohammed Shami's replacement in the Indian Test team for the upcoming Paytm Test against Afghanistan," the BCCI said in a statement.
Shami joins injured wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha on the sidelines as the latter recovers from a thumb injury. Saini has taken 96 wickets in 31 first-class matches and has impressed for Delhi at the domestic Ranji Trophy tournament. The 25-year-old has also been named in the India A squad that will tour England next month.
Following the Afghanistan Test, India begin their tour of England in July with three Twenty20 internationals and three one-day internationals before a five-Test series starting in August.
