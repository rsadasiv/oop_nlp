MilindÂ Soman and Ankita Konwar are now officially man and wife. The duo tied the knot in an intimate ceremony which was attended by close friends and family members at Alibaug on Sunday morning. While there were rumours that the duo has gone through a break-up, the news of their wedding were confirmed when a few pictures from their Haldi and Mehendi ceremonies made it to social media on Saturday and went viral.Â 
Now that the Nation's hottest crush, Milind Soman is no more single (yes, even we took a lot of time to accept and digest this fact), looks like the Twitterati is also unable to rest in peace, even after the nuptials are done. While some of the female fans couldn't help but express their envy with Ankita Konwar, for having Milind Soman for her husband, others just lamented over the fact that the 'Made in India' guy is now a married man.Â 
With some of the fans flooding the micro blogging site with best wishes for the newly married couple and others expressing their heartbreak, Twitter is abuzz with a varied range of reactions on Miling Soman and Ankita Konwar's wedding.Â
