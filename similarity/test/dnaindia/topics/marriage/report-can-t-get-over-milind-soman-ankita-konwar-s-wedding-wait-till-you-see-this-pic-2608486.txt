Remember the ending of Alisha Chinai's music video 'Made In India' when shirtless Milind Soman comes out of a box and made everyone go awwww. Years later, his bride Ankita Konwar shared a uber hot picture of her shirtless groom.
Heathrob Milind Soman broke a million hearts on 22nd April by tying the knot with his girlfriend Ankita Konwar. Defying age gap when in love, the two got married in an intimate in Alibaug near Mumbai. The wedding was attended by family and only a few close friends. Milind Somanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s former girlfriend and 16h December co-star Dipannita Sharma was also a part of the celebration. Their stunning pictures and videos from the wedding have been breaking the Internet and now even Milind and Ankita Konwar's PDA on Instagram is winning our hearts.
After the wedding celebrations wrapped up, the newly married Ankita Konwar took to Instagram and shared a candid picture with her oh-so-sexy husband. In the picture,shirtless Milind is seen admiring Ankita who is dressed in a traditional white and gold saree.Not just the picture even her caption won our hearts. She wrote a famous Pablo Neruda quoteI and it reads, â€oeThen love knew it was called love. And when I lifted my eyes to your name, suddenly your heart showed me my way."
Then love knew it was called love. And when I lifted my eyes to your name, suddenly your heart showed me my way - #pabloneruda #myman #foreveryouandi #love

Ankita even confessed that she didn't like attending marriages before this. Ankita thanked everyone who made it a memorable affair and wrote, "Growing up, I personally never liked weddingsÂ  felt like a lot of effort for no good reason Attended no oneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s wedding but my only sisterâ€<sup>TM</sup>s! But that one wedding changed me. The energy, the support from the family and friends is exactly what a couple needs when they start a new life together. We did have a beautiful wedding with the lovely family and friends and their immense effort to make the day memorable for us was/is/always will be a true blessing. "
