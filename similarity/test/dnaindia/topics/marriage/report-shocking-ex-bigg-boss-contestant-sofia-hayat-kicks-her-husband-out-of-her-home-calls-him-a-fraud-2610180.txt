In what comes across as another shocking twist in the life of ex Bigg Boss contestant Sofia Hayat aka Gaia Mother Sofia Hayat, she has kicked her husband Vlad Stanescu out of her home in the UK, claiming that he's a fraud. The model-tuned-actress-turned-nun has reportedly ended her marriage with Vlad, who's 10 years younger to  her. Some publications reported that Sofia has accused Vlad of raping her, apart from theft, fraud and hiding his real identity, but in a video that she shared on her Instagram account, Sofia has clarified that she hasn't parted ways with her husband because of domestic violence or rape, but because of theft and fraud. 
A report on SpotboyE also suggest that Sofia was pregnant and has lost her unborn baby. She apparently told the portal that Vlad "was a devil, a con man."
In a few Instagram posts, Sofia shared that her Romanian husband Vlad had told her that he's an interior designer which was a lie. She wrote, "You said you were an interior designer who designed palaces...YOU LIED...infact..you were in debt..You said you loved me..YOU LIED..love does not lie or steal..I paid for our sacred Union..I paid for the bills and I paid for our food and clothes..and yet..you wanted to steal more...you wanted everything I had...I met you..you were working in a shop..but I did not care..I still loved you. Everybody warned me not to be with someone who had no home or money..but..I did not listen..I believed in love..but you proved me wrong. So I pushed you out of my home and my life... I have learnt a lesson..that I will never be with anyone again who is not my equal. Who does not give back....He who is honoured to stand by my side...will be my equal..will inspire..create..love and know no darkness.
I allowed my light to shine through you..now you will stay in the darkness that you are. The devil came to me disguised with the face of an angel..and tried to rape me of all that I am..but the sacred Mother is the All and can see the wrong. My power is truth, love and the love for my creation..for all that is good comes from me. There is one creator..Mother..Mata..Sekhmet..Allah Maa..Mary..and one power...LOVE. Anything else..ceases to exist. Now."

Those who've come in late, Sofia Hayat had tied the knot in a beautiful and elaborate ceremony with Vlad on April 24, 2017. The wedding took place in Kensington, UK and Vlad was reported to be an interior designer by profession. This comes as a shocking news for many.
