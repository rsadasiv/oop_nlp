Popular fashion designer Masaba Gupta announced 'trial separation' with filmmaker husband Madhu Mantena on Sunday through a joint statement. Not revealing the actual reason behind their separation, Masaba wrote, "We are not strong enough to explain ourselves to even friends who deserve an answer from us."
A day after making the announcement, Masaba took to Twitter to adress what looks like a media person's question about Madhu having had cheated on her.Â 
Posting a screenshot of her husband and questioner's text conversation, she wrote, â€oeGoing to address this because of the infidelity bit attached. Or maybe I will address more as it comes,given that I wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t tolerate a single thing being said about Madhuâ€<sup>TM</sup>s character. Not true.â€

Masaba, the daughter of veteran actor Neena Gupta and her ex-husband and former West Indian cricketer Sir Vivian Richard, had tied the knot with Madhu in 2015.Â 
While speaking about Masaba, Madhu had said in a 2015 interview, "I can marry her any number of times. She has brought stability into my life. The quality that I like best about Masaba is her straightforwardness. She is blunt and forthright. But unlike other blunt people, she isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t rude or insensitive. She is very kind and compassionate. She understands me instinctively and accepts me with my weaknesses."
The couple has asked for privacy, saying they hope to find â€oereconciliation in our individual paths and dreams and hence this privacy is important for us now.â€Â
