A host of factors contribute to rising incidences of infertility among couples in the city, said Dr Bharat Parikh, a gynecologist in the city.
Dr Parikh, who will be carrying out a month-long free medical check up camp for infertile couples in the city, said couples should seek medical help early.
"It has been my observation that by the time couples approach a doctor for a problem, often they have wasted considerable time. And in addressing issues of infertility, often time (age) is very important," said Dr Parikh.
Dr Parikh will be offering free consultation, sonography and semen analysis, among others, for poor infertile patients at his hospital in Vastrapur, during the month-long camp. Dr Parikh, who is also an IVF expert, said that several factors, including late marriage, multiple abortions, lack of exercise, and excess consumption of junk food are responsible for rising infertility among youth.
He also said that Polycystic ovarian disease was also a cause of rising infertility among women. "When a girl is born, she has the capacity to produce around 4 lakh eggs. Every time she ovulates, her body releases just one egg, which can survive for a period of 12 to 18 hours. As women grow old, the number of egg depletes, but more importantly the quality of egg also decreases, which leads to infertility," said Dr Parikh.
He said among men, apart from lack of exercise, poor dietary habits and sometimes genital deformities, a not widely-known factor is the type of clothes they wear.
"The temperature in the genital area of a man needs to be lower than the overall body temperature. But when you wear tight clothings and clothes made of fabric that does not allow for easy passage of air, the temperature in these areas often increase. This also has a detrimental effect on the sperm count," said Dr Parikh.
He also said that infertility is not treated as a disease even now. "Even medical insurance does not cover the treatment cost most of the time," said Dr Parikh.
