¬†After Kashi-based Vanita Institute of Fashion and Designs introduced a course on 'how to be an ideal daughter-in-law', it appears that a Bhopal-based University has taken a cue and is offering a certificate course.
According to a Times of India report, the Barkatullah University has launched a short-term course to 'prepare an adarsh bahu'. The course, which will begin in the next academic year, will teach girls 'how to adjust to their new environment after marriage.' The vice-chancellor of the university confirmed the same to the daily, saying preparing such brides will 'keep families imtact'.
The course will be started in the departments of psychology, socialogy and women's studies as a pilot project.
Earlier, Kashi-based Vanita Institute of Fashion and Designs introduced a course on 'how to be an ideal daughter-in-law'. .
Named ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>My Daughter, My Pride‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, the course was designed with Kashi-based Vanita Institute of Fashion and Designs after conducting a survey. They said they had received 'tremendous response' from the public and parents during the survey.
The survey claimed that up to 75% of girls 'lacked' confidence. ‚ÄoeEven the educated ones were struck with the fear of their future after marriage. Most of them wanted to pick up a job after tying nuptial knot to support the family. But they were not aware of how to strike a balance between the job and responsibilities back home,‚Äù pointed Srivastava.
CEO Neeraj Srivastava told DNA: ‚ÄoePeople wanted a special course for their marriageable daughters to train them in a variety of skills useful for their careers as well as day to day life after marriage.‚Äù
The course has been initiated by Young Skilled India Start-Up which is incubated with the Malviya Nav Parivartan Kendra of IIT-BHU based on demands of parents.
The CEO of the start-up had, however, clarified to DNA at the time that the initiative wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t officially linked to IIT-BHU.
