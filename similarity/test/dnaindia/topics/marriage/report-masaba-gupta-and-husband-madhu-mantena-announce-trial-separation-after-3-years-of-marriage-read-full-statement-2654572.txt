Designer Masaba Gupta has announced her separation from filmmaker husband, Madhu Mantena. The 29-year-old designer posted a statement on her official Instagram account, and said that she and Mantena have taken a trial separation from their marriage.
Masaba, the daughter of veteran actor Neena Gupta and her ex-husband and former West-Indian cricketer Sir Vivian Richard, had tied the knot with the filmmaker in 2015. The couple consulted their "parents and professionals" before taking the decision.
"The only thing we are ready to say for now is that what we both want out of life individually and separately is putting unnecessary pressure on the marriage and love that we share. Hence, we would like to take some time off from each other and our marriage to figure out for ourselves what we want out of this life," Masaba wrote in the post.
The couple has asked for privacy, saying they hope to find "reconciliation in our individual paths and dreams and hence this privacy is important for us now. We are not strong enough to explain ourselves to even friends who deserve an answer from us. All we can say to each of them is give us time and give us love when we reach out to you. We now need a lot of it," the statement read.

"While we know, given the world and the lives we live in will lead to speculation, rumours and dragging us down into the dirt at this time. We are communicating and encouraging each other to be brave and reminding ourselves the only priority at this time is the well-being and protection of our own selves and our families. Madhu & Masaba," it concluded.
