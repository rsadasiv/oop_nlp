Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's engagement reports have kept all the entertainment journalists on their toes, with a new rumour popping up every now and then. 
When Priyanka Chopra was asked about her rumoured engagement at a recent event in Delhi, she had said that her 'life is not for public consumption' and that she deserves to keep 10% of her life private. 
Nick, however, was more forthcoming at an event in the US. According to an entertainment portal, when a fan congratulated him on his engagement, Nick said, "Thanks, man." This is the closest the couple has come to acknowledging their relationship, after director Ali Abbas Zafar tweeted about Priyanka's exit from 'Bharat' in the 'Nick of Time'.
Nick is keen on starting a family with Priyanka."Having a family of my own is the goal, It's definitely something that I hope will happen. I am not sure of the exact timeline. But, I need to give my nieces cousins at some point," Nick added.
Priyanka had earlier said, "I am a very live in the today, maximum live in the next two months kind of person. But [in] 10 years, I definitely want to have kids. That is, it's going to happen in the next 10 years. Well, hopefully earlier than that. I'm very fond of children and I want to be able to do that."
Nick and Priyanka are expected to get married on September 16.
