Ranbir Kapoor's love life has been doing the rounds on the internet for quite sometime now, especially in connection with co-star Alia Bhatt. After some continuous back-and-forth between the stars regarding whether they actually are an official couple or not, it looks like Ranbir Kapoor might tie the knot pretty soon! At least, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s what his father Rishi Kapoor would like to believe.Â 
In a recent interview with Mid-Day, Rishi Kapoor opened up about wanting to see Ranbir getting married soon, so he can have a bunch of grandchildren to play with.Â "It is high time he got married. I settled down when I was 27, Ranbir is 35. So he should think about marriage. He can marry anyone of his choice; we don't have any objection to it. I want to spend time with my grandchildren before I am gone,"Â the 65-year old actor told Mid-Day.
"I haven't been vocal about it, but my wife [Neetu Kapoor] keeps bringing it up with him and he just brushes the question away. Whenever he is ready for it, we will be happy. Our happiness lies in his happiness, after all," he added.
He also says that he understands that it would be a difficult task to find someone suitable enough to marry, since Ranbir doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t spend much time socialising. â€oeActors have blinkers on and are focused on their work. The only women they meet are the actresses. They don't socialise as much; that is the flipside of life in the movies,"Â he said.
Speaking of socializing with actresses, word still isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t out as to whether Ranbir andÂ BrahmastraÂ co-star Alia are actually dating, with Alia herself having been pretty cagey about it and Ranbir talking about the supposed relationship to GQ Magazine a few months ago. Alia and Neetu Kapoor even share a mutual admiration for each other, and often compliment each other on social media.
On being asked about the suspected romance between the two, Rishi Kapoor saidÂ "Jo hai woh hai, sabko pata hai.Â I don't need to say anything more." Ayan Mukerjiâ€<sup>TM</sup>sÂ Brahmastra, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan, is slated for an Independence Day release, 15 August, 2019.
