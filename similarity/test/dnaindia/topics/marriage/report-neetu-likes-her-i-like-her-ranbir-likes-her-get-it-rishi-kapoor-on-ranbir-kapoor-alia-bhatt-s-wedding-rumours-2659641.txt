Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt make for one of the most adorable love birds in B-Town. The duo, who're currently shooting for Brahmastra, indulge in PDA and it's too cute! Ranbir has found his mue in Alia and keeps on clicking her pictures on the sets and his lady love frequently shares them on social media too.Â 
Ranbir's mom Neetu Kapoor too bonds pretty well with Alia, as is evident from her comments on Alia's posts. Speculations about Ranbir tying the knot with Alia, sometime next year are also rife. While they're mostly being trated as rumours, you never know, what may turn out to be the truth.Â 
Recently, when Rishi Kapoor was asked about Ranbir's plans of tying the knot with Alia, the veteran actor told Mumbai Mirror, "tâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Ranbirâ€<sup>TM</sup>s life. Who he wants to get married to is his prerogative. Neetu likes her, I like her, Ranbir likes her. Get it? I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be judgmental. After all, my uncles Shammiji and Shashiji and I chose our life partners. Ranbir is entitled to choose his.â€Â 
It all began when Ranbir Kapoor first confessed about his new found love for Alia in an interview with GQ magazine. The actor later on refrained from talking much about it, in order to not make a mockery of it. Alia on the other hand neither confirmed not denied her relationship stauts.Â 
The duo are currently in Bulgaria, shooting for the next schedule of Brahmastra.Â
