Years back when these 12 girls were abandoned or thrown out by their own parents, they had no clue how they would spend lives and who would marry them after turning adult, even more, who would bear their expenses of marriage. Their concerns ended on Friday when the Raje government solemnized their marriage and performed all rituals which would have been performed by their parents if they would exist in reality.
Friday came with a hope for 12 girls who were raised in Mahila Sadan run by the social justice department. Clad in Lal Joda (for marriage) and decorated hands with Henna, the brides tied a knot with grooms in the presence of social justice minister Arun Chaturvedi and Chief Secretary DB Gupta who performed all rituals which are done by Peehar (girls side).
They welcomed Baraat, sat in Yajna and even gifted the brides with essential things that would be needed in future. Those things gifted to them include TV, Refrigerator, fan, Dressing Table, Bed, Grinder, Sewing machine, Utensils, Gas stove. To support financially, a cheque of Rs20,000 was given to each newlywed couple.
‚ÄoeThese brides are daughters of the social justice department which raised them. After the marriage, the department officials will also take care of their needs. The department earlier rehabilitated abandoned and got married 25 girls in 2015 too. The girls are living happily at their in-laws home,‚Äù said the minister. He added that when these girls will come to their home (Mahila Sadan), they would be received with social-religious rituals which are performed on the return of the bride.
According to the sources, the brides raised by the department are educated and have been married to those who are employed. Before marriage, the department scanned each groom and after satisfaction, agreed to the marriage.
