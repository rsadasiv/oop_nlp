Not all love stories have a happily ever after and the relationship of popular TV actors Juhi Parmar and Sachin Shroff exemplifies the same. Though, the good-looking couple were married for more than eight years, their marriage hit rock bottom after a few years and eventually they decided to call it quits, by mutual consent. In his recent interview with a leading daily, Sachin Shroff broke his silence on the matter of his divorce with Juhi which took place on July 6 this year. The couple had filed for separation in December last year.¬†
An emotional Sachin was quoted as saying by TOI, "The divorce happened with mutual consent, amicably and in a dignified manner. Unfortunately, and by Juhi's own public admission, she was never in love with me. One-sided relationships are doomed from the beginning. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s said, Its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. But the fact is that it hurts to have been in a loveless marriage. Nothing I did could make Juhi love me.‚Äù
When quizzed about considering to get married again, Sachin shares that he's become more realistic now and he feels that love must be two-sided in orfer to have a flourishing and successful relationship. He added that it's too early for him to think about getting into another relationship or marriage since he's still healing emotionally as he was deeply in love with Juhi. "Let God decide what he has in store for me. I look forward to the rest of my life with optimism and happiness," he was further quoted as saying by the daily.¬†
Those who're caught unaware, soon after the couple got divorced, Juhi Parmar had told Bombay Times that it wasn't an ugly split for both of them but it was because of the fact that they were not compatible enough that they decided to put an end to their relationship before it became suffocating for both of them. The Kumkum actress was quoted by the daily as saying, "‚ÄoeI knew Sachin before our marriage but there was no courtship period as such. He expressed his feelings and we got married immediately after that. I was not fully convinced personally but his love was the biggest driving force. I thought that I will fall in love with him but I still don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know if I can label it as a love marriage. After few years of our marriage, our relationship hit rock bottom. It was difficult for me to accept that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not working out and I was just struggling to keep it going. Finally, I decided that it was best for both of us to separate and Aashka Goradia helped me and stood by my side.‚Äù
