There have been several incidents of weddings being called-off at. Some are broken over dowry and some over the drinking habits, but in Bihar, a bride refused to marry her groom as he behaved in 'strange manner' after lightning.
The incident took place in Bihar's Saran district. TheÂ womanÂ refused to marry the groom when he stated that he was afraid of lightning and started behaving 'differently', reported IANS.
However, the bride's refusal resulted in violent clashes between both the families. When the groom's relatives protested, they wereÂ attacked by the people on the brideâ€<sup>TM</sup>s side.
â€oeAfter the lightning (strike), the groom behaved as he was afraid of it. The bride publicly announced she would not marry him, citing his unusual behaviour,â€ a police officer said.
Three people from the brideâ€<sup>TM</sup>s side were arrested for attacking the groomâ€<sup>TM</sup>s family.
In April this year, marriage was called off in Uttar Pradesh after a heated argument ensued between a close relative of the bride and a cousin of the groom over an extra rasgulla.
Last year in April, a wedding was called off in Muzaffarnagar by the grooms family after they found out that meat was not served in the function.
I n June 2017, the bride called off the wedding in Uttar Pradesh's Shahjahanpur, just before rituals were to begin after she found groom's 'nagin' dance embarrassing.
In 2016, shortage of ice-cream in a marriage party led to heated argument between the bride and groom sides and finally resulted in brick-batting in which three police personnel were injured and the wedding was cancelled.
