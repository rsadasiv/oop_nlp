Not giving a damn to what the haters and naysayers had to say, Milind Soman finally got married to his long time girlfriend Ankita Konwar on Sunday morning. The wedding it reported to be a close knit intimate ceremony with only the family members and very close friends in attendance. Milind Soman and Ankita Konwar's marital nuptials and pre-wedding functions took place in Alibaug, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. 
The wedding functions were spread over two days. The Haldi, Mehendi and Sangeet ceremonies took place on Saturday while the wedding vows were solemnized on Sunday morning. 
Sometime back, rumour mills were busy churning that Milind Soman and Ankita Konwar have gone through a break up but soon after that, the first pictures of their pre-wedding functions appeared on social media and went viral, thereby quashing the rumours. 
A video of the bride and groom dancing on Ban Ja Tu Meri Rani had appeared on Saturday. Later, another video of Milind and Ankita dancing on Oonchi Hai Builing too started doing the rounds. Both the love-birds looked completely lost in each other even as they enjoyed the pre-wedding functions. Later at night on Saturday, the couple slow danced their way to the Sangeet ceremony on soft romantic tracks like Ishq Sufiyana and more.
