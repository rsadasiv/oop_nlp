Ex Bigg Boss contestant and model-turned-actress-turned-nun Sofia Hayat aka Gaia Mother Sofia Hayat recently shared that she has parted ways with her Romanian husband Vlad Stanescu and kicked him out of her UK residence. She took to her Instagram account to share a long note in which she alleged that Vlad had lied to her about him being an interior designer and had stolen her belongings. Now, Vlad's ex girlfriend has also reached out to Sofia and told her that even she had been duped by him in the past. 
Vlad's former girlfriend told Sofia over the message that about 2 years back, she and Vlad were together, before he was to leave for working in London. She shared that when  Vlad decided to leave for London, he stole her belongings from her apartment which included a tablet. Post that, he disappeared and blocked her from all possible modes of communication. The ex girlfriend further empathised with Sofia and sent her blessings to Sofia. 
With her permission, Sofia shared screenshots of their conversation, on her Instagram account. Reportedly, Sofia was pregnant with her first baby but she suffered a miscarriage. 
Earlier, she had shared an Instagram post in which she called Vlad a devil, a liar and a fraud. She wrote, "You said you were an interior designer who designed palaces...YOU LIED...infact..you were in debt..You said you loved me..YOU LIED..love does not lie or steal..I paid for our sacred Union..I paid for the bills and I paid for our food and clothes..and yet..you wanted to steal more...you wanted everything I had...I met you..you were working in a shop..but I did not care..I still loved you. Everybody warned me not to be with someone who had no home or money..but..I did not listen..I believed in love..but you proved me wrong. So I pushed you out of my home and my life... I have learnt a lesson..that I will never be with anyone again who is not my equal. Who does not give back....He who is honoured to stand by my side...will be my equal..will inspire..create..love and know no darkness.
I allowed my light to shine through you..now you will stay in the darkness that you are. The devil came to me disguised with the face of an angel..and tried to rape me of all that I am..but the sacred Mother is the All and can see the wrong. My power is truth, love and the love for my creation..for all that is good comes from me. There is one creator..Mother..Mata..Sekhmet..Allah Maa..Mary..and one power...LOVE. Anything else..ceases to exist. Now."
