The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday ordered the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) to maintain status quo and not fell trees for the housing redevelopment project in South Delhi till further orders. The project has drawn the ire of the Capital's citizens who demonstrated in large numbers against the plans to cut over 17,000 trees last week.
The Tribunal also directed the Centre and the NBCC to make a "categoric statement" with regard to the actual number of trees that would be felled for the project and issued notices to the New Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Delhi Development Authority. A three-member bench, headed by acting chairperson Jawad Rahim, was hearing a clutch of petitions that have sought quashing of environmental clearance granted for the redeveloping old government housing colonies in Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar.
The NGT bench observed that the housing project is likely to have a serious impact on the environment unless proper impact assessment is done and said that the imminent danger to the ecology has to be kept in mind. "Even though we give sufficient time to the project proponent to file their replies to the interim relief, we are satisfied prima facie case is made out for grant of ad-interim order in the nature of protective order so as to protect environment which always is a party in absentia before courts and the Tribunal and its preservation is essential," the bench said in its order.
It added, "Applying the precautionary principle, we direct ... status quo, particularly in the matter of felling of trees and direct that there shall be no felling, cutting destruction of trees till further order."
The NGT's order to maintain status quo also comes on the back of Delhi High Court's June 25 order staying the felling of trees for the projects. The high court had asked if Delhi could afford tree-felling of such a large-scale. During Monday's hearing, the petitioner argued before the bench that in light of the Delhi High Court order, there should be no tree-felling as it will severely impact the Capital's environment.Â 
NBCC counsel Pinaki Mishra and counsel for Urban Affairs ministry BV Niren said that allegations made in the petition are factually incorrect and they refuted that more large-scale tree felling was needed.
The re-development scheme plans to replace existing units of Type I to IV with a built-up area of around 7.49 lakh square metre with Type II to VI units with built-up area of around 29.18 lakh sqm with supporting infrastructure facilities.
