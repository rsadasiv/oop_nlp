The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana (BBBPY) has got a Dangal makeover in Jammu and Kashmir. Seemingly inspired by the Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal, the state government is using wrestling to empower women.
Under the BBBPY, Udhampur district in Jammu division held a wrestling competition in which around 42 national and international-level wrestlers from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and J&K participated. This first-ever exclusive women wrestling day-long event was held on Wednesday.
"We are trying to change the mindset of people," said Ravinder Kumar, district development commissioner of Udhampur. "We want to prove that girls can do better than boys. People think we need to protect girls more than boys. We want to prove that our girls can excel in every field and dangal is the best way to showcase their talent."
"Parents need to understand their role in ensuring that their girl child gets proper upbringing, education and all facilities for overall development and emancipation," said Choudhary Lal Singh, J&K Minister for Forests and Environment.
Officials are also trying to relive the magic of the Olympics to motivate the girls to join sports. "When Sakshi Malik won the Olympic medal, she received appreciation and accolades from everywhere. Even boys cannot match the support she got. We have invited students from schools and colleges so that they too feel motivated," adds Kumar.
