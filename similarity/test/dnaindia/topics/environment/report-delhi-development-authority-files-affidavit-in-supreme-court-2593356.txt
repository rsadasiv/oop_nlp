The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finally filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Monday regarding proposed amendments to the Delhi Master Plan -2021 in order to allow relief to traders from the ongoing sealing drive in the Capital.
"The government has filed the affidavit in the Supreme Court regarding sealing issue," Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri took to Twitter to announce the move.
The apex court had pulled up the DDA, the Delhi government and the municipal corporations for not filing the affidavit last week.
The court had stayed the amendments to the Master Plan for the agencies not conducting a survey of the impact of the changes proposed in the Plan on the environment.
The top court had asked agencies that they could not make any amendments to the Master Plan without completing the survey of its impact on the people of Delhi.
The stay in the amendments had come as a dampener for traders who were hoping some relief from the changes.
The sealing drive is being conducted on directions of a Supreme Court-appointed Monitoring Committee.
