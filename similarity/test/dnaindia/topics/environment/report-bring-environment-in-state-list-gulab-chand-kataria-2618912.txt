Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria has suggested bringing in the environment subject in the state list from the centre list.
Representing Rajasthan at the Inter-State Council meeting on the recommendations of the Punchhi Commission, Kataria said that there are many subjects which should be kept in the state list instead of being in concurrent or centre list.
Kataria said that due to lack of environmental clearance, many projects of the state are stuck and added that by moving the subject moved to the state will accelerate development works.
He also said that water distribution should be done on the basis of the catchment area of rivers. As the catchment area of most rivers is not in Rajasthan, therefore, the rules which are made in this regard should not be applied to Rajasthan.
