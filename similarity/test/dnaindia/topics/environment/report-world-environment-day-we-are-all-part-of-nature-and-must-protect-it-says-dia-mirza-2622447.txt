On the eve of World Environment Day, Zee Business's Anil Singhvi, interviewed actress Dia Mirza, brand ambassador for the Wildlife Trust of India and UN Environment's Goodwill Ambassador for India, asking her about her involvment in spreading awareness on environment-related issues.
I have been directly associated with environment-related issues for the past 10 years. I consider myself to be a part of nature and hope that people will also realise the same to then start protecting the things that are provided to use free-of-cost by Mother Nature.
Rumi has said, "You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop". There are people like Aditya Singh a 14-year-old boy who has started a movement in Delhi in which he goes to institutions and industrialists and asks them to curb their plastic intake. Similarly, Rajeshwari Singh, a 32-year-old woman, has walked from Gujarat to Delhi with an aim to raise awareness about plastic pollution and to inspire people to stop use of single-use plastic items.
I don't use plastic brushes and have replaced them with bamboo. I don't use plastic earbuds and have replaced them with earbuds made of bamboo and cotton. I have replaced regular sanitary napkins, which are mostly made of plastics, with bio-degradable napkins. I carry my personal metallic water bottle, so that I can refill them wherever I get a filter. This has helped me to say no to packaged plastic water bottles. Apart from this, whenever I go to the restaurant and order a drink, I always ask the waiter to not give me a plastic straw.
