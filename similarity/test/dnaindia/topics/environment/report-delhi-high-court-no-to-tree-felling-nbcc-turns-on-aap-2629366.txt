Even as the Delhi High Court on Monday put on hold the chopping of 17,000 tress in the capital for urban development, the National Buildings Construction Corporation(India) Limited called out Aam Admi Party's somersault over the tree-felling row and said it was the Delhi government that gave it the go-ahead.
Putting a stay on the decision to cut the trees, the court observed, "We could understand if it was a road-widening work, which is inevitable. You want to cut thousands of trees for housing. Can Delhi afford this?"
Addressing a press conference on Monday, Anoop Kumar Mittal, chairman-cum-managing director, NBCC said that in case of Delhi, the state government called the shots. "The environment ministry cleared the decks for our project. Had it been a Union Territory, the Centre would have taken a call," he said. Not mincing any words, Mittal detailed, "Permissions have been obtained from Delhi government and other authorities for redeveloping Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar where we will plant 10,000 trees apart from paying from green coverage," the CMD said.
In the last few days, the party has raised its pitch against the NBCC's decision to cut thousands of trees, calling it "callous towards environment in their quest to achieve urban development".
Additionally, the party has been drumming support for its own Chipko Movement.
Putting forward the party's stance, Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said that the AAP government will oppose chopping of trees tooth and nail, claiming that the Delhi government has been against the measures all along. "Environment minister Imran Hussain had even given in writing that NBCC should look for alternatives," Bhardwaj said.
To add to the mix, however, Lt Governor Anil Baijal's office said that the proposals for redeveloping Nauroji Nagar and Netaji Nagar were duly endorsed by Hussain. In a statement, Baijal's office said an impression is being created in sections of media that the permission for felling the trees was granted by the L-G directly despite objections from Hussain.
