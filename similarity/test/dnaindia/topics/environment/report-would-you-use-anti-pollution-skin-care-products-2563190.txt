On a daily basis, most of us city dwellers are exposed to a large amount of pollution. Be it the exhaust from cars, factory soot, dirt and dust, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enough to seep into the pores and cause acne breakouts or even dry out skin. Given the recent Delhi smog as well as air pollution levels reaching an all-time high, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s essential to protect your skin from these elements. Catering to these, are a slew of anti-pollution skin care products from creams to masks and facial mists. Experts tell us how to take care of the skin.
The rise in air pollution over the years has had a major impact on skin. Air pollutants such as ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, oxides, particulate matter, ozone and cigarette smoke affect the skin severely, explains Dr Rohit Batra, dermatologist, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and Dermaworld Skin & Hair Clinic. ‚ÄoeProblems arise when an abnormal exposure to environmental pollutants exceed the skin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s normal defensive potential. Air pollutants damage the skin by inducing oxidative stress. In human skin, exposure to ozone causes a decrease in vitamin E concentration, and reduction in skin microflora. Pollution breaks down collagen and the lipid layer in the skin thereby impairing skin barrier functions.¬† It can result in uneven skin tone, dark spots etc. Excessive exposure to UV radiation has been associated with extrinsic skin ageing and skin cancer too. Cigarette smoke too contributes to premature ageing and an increase in the incidence of psoriasis, acne and skin cancer,‚Äù says Dr Batra.
There are simple measures to combat this, says Dr Shefali Trasi Nerurkar, MD Skin, consultant dermatologist, Dr Trasi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Clinic and La Piel. ‚ÄoeUse a long sleeve shirt and cover your face with a scarf or handkerchief regularly. Apply sunscreen on a daily basis in the morning and repeat after every few hours. Develop the habit of washing your face at least two to three times in a day. Today, air purifiers are available in the market. One can get one installed at their homes or offices. Regular intake of water helps hydrate the skin, improves circulation and minimises dark circles under the eyes. Omega 6 found in many foods like eggs, chicken, meat, grains andseeds help too,‚Äù she adds.
A breakdown of collagen and elastin in the body due to exposure to pollution, causes lines and wrinkles and accelerates pigmentation. It can also lead to skin inflammation and irritation resulting in allergies, eczema, rosacea, and acne. Dr Geeta Fazalbhoy, dermatologist and founder Skin N You, says one can combat the ill effects with a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. ‚ÄoeLook for agents like niacinamide in creams, vitamin E and vitamin C. One can use a light, exfoliating cream containing glycolic acid thrice a week. Stem cell¬† creams and hyaluronic acid creams are also beneficial. Add antioxidant vitamins to the diet containing coq 10 , caretonoids and a vitamin called sodox.‚Äù Dr Vandana Punjabi, consultant dermatologist and cosmetologist suggests an anti-acne face wash and acne creams to help combat the pollution and build-up of keratin , thus preventing acne flares.
