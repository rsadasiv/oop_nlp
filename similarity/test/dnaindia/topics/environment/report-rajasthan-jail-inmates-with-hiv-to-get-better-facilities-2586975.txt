As per studies, the people living in prisons and other closed settings are at an increased risk of HIV infection because they lack access to preventive and care services, making these settings a high-risk environment for HIV transmission. With the intention to improve access and quality of HIV prevention, care and treatment services for people living in prisons and other closed settings of the state, a new intervention program has been launched.
The program will cover all the central jails, select sub-jails or district jails and other closed settings in the state.¬†
