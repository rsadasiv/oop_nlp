Seven years ago, Fortune Heights resident Monisha Narke embarked on a mission to do her bit for the environment. She began segregating waste at her home undeterred by the fact that the rubbish coming out other flats in her society was all mixed-up.
Over the next two years, her neighbours and other members at the Mahim society began appreciating her efforts. By 2012, they all went green
‚ÄoeI started composting the wet waste at home, but soon realised that such initiatives at an individual level suffer from limitations with regard to space and the volume of waste generated. As a community, we can do it more efficiently and produce more compost.‚Äù
About her lone journey, Narke said, ‚ÄoeIn the beginning, only a few members supported the cause. People don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have much idea about this concept. The society members raised concerns such as the sustainability of the initiative and space required.‚Äù
Gradually, the members began supporting the cause. ‚ÄoeWe went beyond wet and dry waste segregation to rainwater harvesting, tetra-pack recycling and organic gardening.‚Äù
Narke, now 43, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop at that. Today, she runs an NGO named ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>RUR: Are you Reducing, Reusing, Recycling?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> through which tries to inspire other societies, schools and colleges to manage waste.
