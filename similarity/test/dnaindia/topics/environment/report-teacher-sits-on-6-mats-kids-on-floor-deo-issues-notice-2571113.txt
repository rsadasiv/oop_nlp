During winter, people seek cozy environment! But, when you are at work, this might not be possible.
The District Education Officer (DEO) Mahesh Mehta has recently issued a notice to a teacher of a government school in Ahmedabad district for sitting on six mats even as 25 children of the class sat on the cold floor in winter.
Interestingly, the teacher, Deepika Suthar of government primary school of Loliya village in Dholka block, had placed the mats on the top of two chairs. The mats were meant for Pragya classes.
Mehta spotted this 'insensitivity' on a field visit and as a punishment, Suthar's one year increment has been stalled. The episode will also find a mention in her Service Book. The officer found out that the kids were asked to bring mats from their homes if they want to sit on the same though under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, the mats and school infrastructure has been provided to each school.
The notice read that as per the disciplines and disputes, the teacher has barred the kids from their child rights. It further stated that according to Gujarat Panchayat Service Rule 1997 Act-6, without any future implication she will be barred from an increment.
