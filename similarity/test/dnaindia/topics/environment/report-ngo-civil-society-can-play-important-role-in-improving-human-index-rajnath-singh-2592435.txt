Home Minister Rajnath Singh emphasised upon the collaborative effort by all the agencies towards social development. He was speaking at a corporate event here on Friday. Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, was also present at the occasion.
Giving a spin to the definition of Gross Domestic Product, he said that Gross Domestic Prosperity is the key goal of the government. "In a country like ours it is important for everyone government corporates NGOs and civil society should work together towards development agenda. In the years to come we will work towards gross domestic prosperity," he said. He also released the second edition of the The Fifth Estate - NGOs Transforming Rural India in Environment, Health and Education', which is a comprehensive sector compendium of the NGOs doing path breaking work and striving towards empowerment of rural India.
"I am aware of the reality that the government alone cannot achieve the aim of social responsibility. Along with the government, support from civil society and NGOs is equally important. There are a lot of areas where the government cannot reach but NGOs are doing ground work," Singh said while appreciating the various social work undertaken by not for profit organisations. The Home Minister also acknowledged the slow development of the country because of its sheer size. "India is such a huge country that even after 70 years of Independence, the kind of homogeneous development that should have taken place in the country has still not happened," he stated.
