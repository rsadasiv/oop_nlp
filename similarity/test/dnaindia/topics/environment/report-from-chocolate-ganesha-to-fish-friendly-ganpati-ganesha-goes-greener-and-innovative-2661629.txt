One only has to take a walk on one of the beaches in Mumbai on the morning after the Ganpati visarjan to comprehend the extent of water pollution. Broken pieces of the idols, mostly made of Plaster of Paris (PoP), are strewn around everywhere and the ones that do find their way to the sea, take months to dissolve, polluting the waters and damaging the environment. However, some forward-thinking individuals and organisations are finding ways in which people can celebrate the festival without harming the surroundings, with their innovative Ganesh murtis. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a look at some of them...
For the past 15 years, Dattadri Kothur has been making eco-friendly Ganeshas. But in 2015, when the commercial artist made an idol that could be watered and turned into a plant, the 32-year-old Lower Parel resident received a lot of positive response on social media. Dattadri received 300 orders the following year. ‚ÄoeWe received a lot of orders this year, but have taken on only 2,000 of them,‚Äù he tells us. Made of red soil, organic fertiliser, natural colour and filled with either neem, ladyfinger or marigold seeds, the idols are available in different sizes.
A Ganesha devotee, Rintu Rathod would get disturbed with the sight of broken idol pieces post visarjan day. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a commercial designer and baker, and so, I was struck by the idea of making Ganpati idols with chocolate and immersing them in milk. I would then distribute the chocolate milk among underprivileged children,‚Äù Rintu recalls, adding that not only is the idol eco-friendly, with its ability to put a smile on children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s faces, it is humanity friendly as well. For the past two years, she has also been taking workshops to teach others the art of making Ganpati idols with chocolate. Although Rintu has been making the figurines for the past seven years, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only in 2017 that she started taking orders for it. ‚ÄoeTill last year, I was making them all by hand, and so I could only take 26 orders. This year, I have started using moulds, so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m making 51 of them,‚Äù she says, adding that she has bigger plans for the festival in 2019.
Now, here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Ganpati statue even the fish will love! At Sprouts Environment Trust, murtis are made of clay and filled with fish-friendly food including dried corn, spinach and chickpea powder. These dissolve much faster when immersed in water as they are smaller in size, made of river clay and are hollow inside to stuff in the food filling. Founder Anand Pendharkar says this is the fourth year they are making these eco-Ganpatis, using the campaign‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hashtag #GodSaveTheOcean and the number of orders has only increased by each passing year. ‚ÄoeWe are also using a multifold approach this year. The idea is to reach out to community organisations and schools for children to convince their parents to stop using PoP idols and have workshops where we can teach women self-help groups to make and sell these idols. We are also educating people into immersing permanent idols made of metal or stone into buckets of water so that there is no water pollution,‚Äù he says.
