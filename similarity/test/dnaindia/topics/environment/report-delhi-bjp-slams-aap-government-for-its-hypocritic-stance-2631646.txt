The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has again slammed the Delhi government over the tree row that also has residents up in arms. Senior party leaders have trained guns at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), claiming that the ruling party has done a U-turn by championing the cause of environment after granting permission to cut trees.
The leader of the Opposition, Vijender Gupta, called out the "hypocritic" stance of the AAP which is creating noise for the past few weeks against chopping of trees by the NBCC for its development projects in Netaji Nagar and Nauroji Nagar. He said that the Delhi government was to plant more than 39,000 trees at both these places."Instead, Environment Minister Imran Hussain released orders to cut them without due diligence or following the procedure of first planting trees. It is another of his antics to fool the public," he said.
Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa has been more scathing in his attack towards the AAP. He said that the government is staging another drama to cover its wrongs. "Why cry hoarse now that thousands of trees have already been cut? It is so apparent that AAP minister granted permission for it.Â 
The government, however, is passing the buck to the Congress when questioned by the Opposition," he stated. "Kejriwal government is accusing Sheila Dikshit of the pass given to NBCC. We are curious to know why the AAP in spite of being in power, is behaving like a sitting duck," asked Sirsa.
The Delhi High Court had put on hold the chopping of 17,000 trees in the Capital for urban development, on Monday. Putting a stay on the decision to cut the trees, the court observed, "We could understand if it was a road-widening work, which is inevitable. You want to cut thousands of trees for housing. Can Delhi afford this?"
