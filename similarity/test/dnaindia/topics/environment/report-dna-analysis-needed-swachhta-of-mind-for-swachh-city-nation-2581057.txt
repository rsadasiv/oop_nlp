One of the most ambitious initiatives taken by the government of India, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aims at a clean and hygienic country.¬†
Catering to the need of the hour, the local body of town Jaipur Municipal corporation (JMC) seems really enthusiastic about this one. But is Swachh Bharat an initiative only for the government? Are we, the youth, not responsible for the current state of hygiene and cleanliness of our own country?
‚ÄoeI think it is not only government‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s responsibility to make a Swacch India, people have to play a major role in creating a clean and neat environment,‚Äù said one of the principal of a private school, during Swachh Survekshan of city schools.¬†
During the joint inspection (survekshan) by JMC official, Indrajeet Singh and member of DNA one thing which was observed that the mindset of school kids and administration towards a cleaner environment is changing in a positive direction.¬†
Deputy Commissioner for JMC¬† Indrajeet Singh says that the school kids are future of our country and I think they will play a major role in shaping a cleaner environment.¬†
He further added that by following steps are the key for a Swachh India; Anti-litter campaigns: Create awareness in your apartment community and neighborhood and motivate them to take up the broom; Share pictures: You can share pictures of unclean spots in your neighborhood and the same spot after your cleanliness drive.
Stop complaining & start participating: This should be the mantra for the success of the Swachh Bharat mission.
The reach of youngsters is way beyond political barriers and reach of technology. Swachh Bharat can become way bigger if only we give it a chance to become big.¬†We need to be an active part of the campaign for it to become effective on a nation-wide level.¬†We are the nation and like Mahatma Gandhi rightly said, we should be the change we wish to see in the society!
