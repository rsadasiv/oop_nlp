"Monday ko aana" was the refrain from security guards manning the main gate of Jawahar Lal Nehru University (JNU) which was out of bounds for media persons on Saturday. Violence had marred counting of votes of JNU Students' Union (JNUSU) when a group of students forcibly entered the counting centre and tried to snatch ballot boxes.
Security was beefed up in and around the university with Delhi Police guarding the entrance. A large number of private security guards including women were deployed outside the counting hall. They had formed a ring around the protesting students, to prevent them from going inside the centre. No student was allowed inside without their identity card. Visitors were being checked for their identity card, and no one from outside the campus was allowed to enter. Entering the premises was an arduous task even for public transport like autos and cabs that were being checked thoroughly.
OB vans were parked outside the main campus as journalists attempted to gain access, only to be thwarted by the guards who parroted, "Monday ko aana" again and again. On being asked, one of the guards on duty refused to be named said, "The media has been barred from entering the university since 6 am We have got orders to not allow reporters inside." "Votes are being counted inside. There was some hungama also. Monday is the best day to come and meet whoever you want. University will remain closed tomorrow also," another guard chipped in.
The students' body poll for JNU was conducted in a keenly fought contest on Friday, followed by the counting which was stopped midway in the wee hours of Saturday.
