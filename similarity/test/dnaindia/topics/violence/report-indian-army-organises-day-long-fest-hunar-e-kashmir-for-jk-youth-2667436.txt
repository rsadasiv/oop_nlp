Thanks to the Indian Army, a day-long youth festival 'Hunar-e-Kashmir' (talent of Kashmir) is set to sooth the nerves and promote peace in the trouble-torn Valley.
The festival comes at a time when the Kashmir valley is witnessing resurgence of terror and violence, particularly in south Kashmir region. This year around 37 policemen have been killed in the state, which is the highest in the last 12 years. Around 150 terrorists have been killed in different encounters this year so far.
Leaving behind the turmoil, the Army is extending a hand of friendship to the youth in order to help them build a career and promote peace.
"The Youth Festival is being conducted with an aim to inculcate the spirit of creativity among the youth, provide information on various careers, encourage participation in sports and promote peace," said Colonel Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesman at Srinagar.
Musical and cultural extravaganza involving top Bollywood singers and artists, career counselling and information kiosks, singing and calligraphy competitions are all planned in the day-long festival to be held at Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre on the banks of Dal Lake on Saturday. Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik will be the chief guest of the festival.
"A large number of events, like solo and group singing, band display, painting, calligraphy, etc, will be organised. The grand finale of the festival will be a Cultural/Musical show by renowned and accomplished Bollywood singer Javed Ali. Noted film and television personalities including Gurmeet Choudhary, Debina Bonnerjee and Tina Dutta will also be present," said Colonel Kalia.
Top sports personalities, who carved niche in the national and international stage, will also be felicitated by the Army on this occasion. The list of personalities include participants of Asian games 2018 from the state, winners (both boys and girls) of Jhelum Football Championship and Mountain Expedition Team.
"A large number of youth are expected to participate from all over Jammu and Kashmir in this festival," said Colonel Kalia.
The day-long festival, named Hunar-e-Kashmir (talents of Kashmir) will be held at Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre on the banks of Dal Lake on September 29.
