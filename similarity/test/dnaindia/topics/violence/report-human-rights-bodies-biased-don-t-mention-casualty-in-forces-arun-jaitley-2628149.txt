Union minister Arun Jaitley on Friday accused the leftist liberals of taking over the civil liberty movements by infiltrating into organisations like PUCL and PUDR over the years, and said that these organisations are now actively coordinating with "jehadis and separatists" in Jammu and Kashmir. He also said that the 'Tukde-Tukde' gang in JNU and Hyderabad "have earned Rahul Gandhi's sympathy."
A Facebook blog post that Jaitley shared on Twitter as well, he said that "political adventurists in parties like AAP and TMC are looking at political opportunities in these groups". He also said that "non-weaponised ideological Maoists" have also infiltrated into western human rights organisations to sully India's image".
Speaking of the situation in Kashmir, Jaitley said that "muscular policy in Kashmir" is needed to deal with "fidayeens" who are willing to die and kill. He argued that the government cannot wait for a political situation to evolve.
He also said that human rights organisations that condemn violence in the Valley only reported casualties on one side. "The human rights organisations, which have been taken over by the ultra-left, have never spoken about the deprivation of human rights of innocent citizens who are victims of their violence. They have never a tear to shed in the indiscriminate killing of security personnel. They have a propaganda policy and have successfully infiltrated their evil idea," wrote Jaitley.
"In the past few years, they expanded their strategy and started coordinating with jehadis and separatists, notwithstanding their ideological dissimilarity. The only thing common between them is violence, the overthrow of constitutional order, and secessionism, i.e., breaking up India. Recent evidence suggests that they are trying to rope in some misguided Dalit activists into their fold. This became apparent after the 'Tukde Tukde' agitation in the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the events that followed in Hyderabad thereafter," wrote the former finance minister.
Jaitley's comments come in the light of the first report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights violation in Kashmir, which termed it as "impunity for human rights violations and lack of access to justice are key human rights challenges in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir". India dismissed the report and the ruling BJP party withdrew from the government in the disturbed state where it ruled in coalition with the PDP.
