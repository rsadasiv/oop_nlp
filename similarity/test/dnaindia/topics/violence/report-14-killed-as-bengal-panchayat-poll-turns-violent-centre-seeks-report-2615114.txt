At least 14 persons were reportedly killed and hundreds others injured as violent clashes marred Monday's panchayat polls in West Bengal, though the State Election Commission (SEC) confirmed only six deaths. Police made 311 arrests as reports of booth capture poured in from across the state.
The Opposition blamed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for perpetrating violence to win the elections and further her prime ministerial ambitions. The Union Home Ministry (MHA) sought a report from the state government on the violence. Ruling TMC has already won 20,163 of the total 58,692 seats unopposed.
SEC sources said there was an overall 72.5 per cent polling till 5 pm. "The figure will go up slightly because about seven lakh people were still in queues, one hour after the poll process was officially over," said an official. It's a battle of survival for the Left and Congress. BJP hopes to establish itself as the main Opposition in West Bengal.
State Director General of Police Surajit Kar Purkayastha, however, said polling was overall peaceful. "There were stray incidents, but violence and deaths are less than earlier times," he said. Ruling TMC also claimed polling was peaceful.
BJP state president Dilip Ghosh led a delegation to meet Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi. "We told the Governor about the violence. Many poll officers did not turn up out of fear. About 80 per cent booths in Cooch Behar were looted. Polling officials were hiding. BSF had to intervene to save them. At least 7-8 of our men died today," he said. State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury said, "Our worst nightmares came true. Police and TMC goons together carried out vote loot and violence," he said.
The Left Front also blamed TMC cadres for the violence. "TMC's armed gangs captured hundreds of booths in almost all districts, chased away voters, cordoned villages to force people to remain indoors", it said.
TMC minister Partha Chatterjee said there was one or two stray incidents but the administration was quick to deal with those. "In the past, during the Left rule, there was bloodbath. Today, even TMC people have died," he said.
