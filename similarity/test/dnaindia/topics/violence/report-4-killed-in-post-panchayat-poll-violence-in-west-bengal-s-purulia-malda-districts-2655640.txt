Two more persons were killed at Manikchak in Malda after the formation of panchayat boards. A three-year-old also sustained injuries due to bomb splinters.
Locals said that of the 10 seats of Gopalpur panchayat, Congress and TMC had secured five each and violence erupted following an argument as to who would be the panchayat pradhan.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said, "I have heard there had been trouble in certain parts of Bengal. I have also been told that the BJP brought in people from outside Bengal to create trouble. I have asked police and administration to deal with the matter strictly. Some policemen have also been injured. We will not tolerate such hooliganism."
