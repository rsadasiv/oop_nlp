Four days after violence and arson was reported at some places during the Maharashtra bandh last week, global giant Siemens raised a red flag, saying that the violence had impacted the company's production at Walunj unit in Aurangabad. The company's property at Walunj was also severely damaged during the 'peaceful bandh' called by Maratha quota agitators across the state last week.
Speaking to DNA exclusively, a Siemens spokesperson said, "We are concerned about the incidents of violence on August 9 at our premises in Aurangabad. This has not only impacted our production schedule, but it has also resulted in damage to property. It also compromised the safety of our employees, which is of paramount importance to us."
The spokesperson, however, clarified that Siemens will continue to be committed to its business in Aurangabad notwithstanding last week's violence.
It may be recalled that the Siemens' plant in Aurangabad was among the 60 industrial units, where Maratha agitators demanding quota for the community. Some Maratha quota agitators went on a rampage when most of those units were not operational. The company produces switchgears at its Walunj plant which has completed more than 26 years of its operations there.
The Chamber of Marathwada Industries & Agriculture (CMIA), Confederation of Indian Industry's Aurangabad chapter, Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries & Agriculture (MASSIA) and Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) representing over 4,500 units with investment worth Rs 60,000 crore had voiced their concerns and sought strict action against those involved in arson and vandalism.
CMIA president Ram Bhogle said production in 60 units had already resumed and normalcy has been restored at the Walunj Industrial estate, Aurangabad. The police has arrested more than 60 persons so far and is carrying out further investigations.
