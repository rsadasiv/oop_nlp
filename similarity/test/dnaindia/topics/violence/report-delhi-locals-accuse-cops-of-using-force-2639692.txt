Clashes in Trilokpuri have left the locals anguished and remorseful as well. During the clashes last night, many innocent passersby's were allegedly dragged into the fight and sustained injuries. Stones were thrown inside houses which left them horrified during the late hours on Thursday.
A petty argument between some boys turned into a huge communal clash within just a few minutes."This is not the first time our locality has faced such an incident, another stone pelting incident took place just a few days back. We are used to these clashes, but I just want peace," said Shrishti, a local.
Family members of Shoaib, Rashid and Noor Mohammad, who gheraoed the Mayur Vihar Police station on Thursday night alleged that the cops lathi-charged them to disperse them. "We had gone to register a complaint that our brother Shoaib was brutally thrashed by the other group. The police instead of registering our complaint used force and violence against us," said Noor Mohammad, who was arrested later.
However, police denied that any force was used against the locals.
On Friday, the whole area could be seen covered with broken glass and stones, cars in the vicinity were damaged and the windows of some houses were also broken. "Police banged our doors at night with sticks, I was not even aware of what was happening. They misbehaved with my family, I don't feel safe anymore," said Harman Singh, a local.
