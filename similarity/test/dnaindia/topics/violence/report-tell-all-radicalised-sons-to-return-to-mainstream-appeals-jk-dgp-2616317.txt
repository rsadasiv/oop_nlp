Jammu and Kashmir's Director General of police Dr Shesh Paul Vaid has publicly appealed to families to convince their radicalised sons to abjure violence and return home. "Taking advantage of the fresh initiative of Government of India during Ramzan, families of local militants should urge their sons to leave path of violence and join them to live peacefully. [We] Wish them good luck," tweeted Dr Vaid.
The appeal comes against the backdrop of highly educated youth joining terrorist outfits. More than 50 youth have joined militant ranks since January, including those with PhDs, MBAs and Masters degrees.
"We want to cash in on the halting of anti-terror ops and use the confidence-building measure to send the message that the gun is no solution. Last year, our calls had the desired effect and some youth had shun violence and returned home. This year too we hope Ramzan will be the watershed moment," said a police officer.
According to official figures, 126 Kashmiri youth â€" the highest number in three years â€" joined terrorist ranks in the Valley in 2017. In all, nearly 280 youth have been radicalised in the last three years â€" 66 in 2015 and 88 in 2016.
Official figures reveal that since November 2017, six youth heeded their family's appeal and gave up violence to return home. The trend started in November last year after 20-year-old footballer-turned-terrorist Majid Khan returned home after his mother's heart-wrenching appeal on video went viral on social media.
