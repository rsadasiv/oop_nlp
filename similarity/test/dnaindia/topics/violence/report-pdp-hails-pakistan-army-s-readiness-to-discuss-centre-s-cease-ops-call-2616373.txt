Terming Pakistan army's readiness to hold dialogue with India "a very positive development taking place at a very right time", Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said that after Centre's Ramzan cease ops call, Pakistan military's statement has instilled new hope to the people of the state for a better, peaceful, and dignified future.
Media reports suggested that Pakistani military spokesman Major General Asif Gafoor had indicated to join a dialogue process with India. Major General Gafoor was talking to the visiting Indian media persons in Pakistan.
"The statement made by the Pakistan army has to be welcomed as it aims to put a lid over violence and usher in an era of peace. Perpetual efforts are needed from all sides so that the two countries come closer and make peace an inseparable feature of the sub-continent. The hostilities only have yielded death and destruction," said Mansoor Hussain Soharwardhy, PDP General Secretary.
Mansoor noted that both India and Pakistan should take immediate measures for de-escalation, opening of more routes, initiate talks with the stakeholders, and ensure successful people-to-people contact on both the sides of the border and Line of Control (LoC).
"The time has come when the political leadership, armies, and the civil societies of both India and Pakistan pitch for sustainable dialogue and reconciliation as the only means to address the pending issues and save precious lives. Such a development will strengthen the reconciliatory measures that are in the offing between the two countries," he said
PDP General Secretary also said that foundation of PDP was laid upon the principle of restoration of peace and end of enmity between the two countries. "Time is vindicating the earnest and consistent stand of the PDP towards everlasting, peaceful and honourable solution of Kashmir conflict," he said.
Mansoor leader said that time has come when irrespective of the party lines, the political groups in Kashmir too need to rise above and play a constructive role in unison so that state's present generation is saved from mayhem and bloodshed.
