Six members of Makkal Adhikaram â€" an ultra-Left organisation â€" were on Monday booked under the National Security Act after previously being booked in several cases related to inciting violence during the anti-Sterlite protests on May 22 where 13 people were killed in the police firing.
Kaleel Rahman (47), his sons Mohamed Irshad (21) and Mohamed Yunus (22), Kottaiyan (36), Saravanan (29), and Velmurugan (26) were detained under the NSA on the orders of Home Secretary Niranjan Mardi. All of them are lodged in the Palayamkottai Central Prison.
However, advocate C Raju, state coordinator of Makkal Adhikaram said that the police has been attempting to hike their daylight extra-judicial killing by blaming his organisation. "Except for the fact that all the six people took part in the protest, there is no evidence to prove that they indulged in the violence," he said.
