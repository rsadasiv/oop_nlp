The sudden split with the coalition partner BJP in Jammu & Kashmir could have come as a body blow to outgoing Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, but she put up a brave face to meet media where she detailed her government‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s achievements. She, however, failed to give an explanation on what went wrong, leading to the fall of her government.
‚ÄoeOur basic aim to come together was to start reconciliation process, dialogue, good relations with Pakistan and confidence-building process. Major apprehension was about Article 370. We defended it and special status under Article 370 in courts. We withdrew cases against 11,000 people (stone pelters). We facilitated unilateral ceasefire. We facilitated the offer of dialogue not less than from the level of Home minister,‚Äù she said.
Mehbooba listed her achievements including dealing with Kathua rape and murder, action against cow vigilantes, safety and security of minorities in Jammu. ‚ÄoeWe tried to keep three regions together. Our workers tolerated lot on ground and despite that they worked hard. We tried hard for ceasefire,‚Äù she said.¬†
She also cautioned against having a muscular policy for J&K. ‚ÄoeWe have always said that muscular policy will not work. We can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t treat J&K as enemy territory. Therefore muscular policy will not work here,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄoePeople had heaved a sigh of relief after the truce. Unfortunately there was no response from the other side. Efforts from other side were that the ceasefire should end. Our agenda is always of healing touch, talks, reconciliation and we will continue to pursue that,‚Äù she said.
Earlier, BJP leader Ram Madhav, announcing his party‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision to withdraw support said: ‚ÄoeWe have taken a decision, it is untenable for BJP to continue in alliance with PDP, hence we are withdrawing.‚Äù
‚ÄoeRestoring peace in Kashmir and encouraging fast development in J&K, these were the objectives we joined with PDP. A lot has been done for the state‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s development by the Modi govt. It has done whatever was feasible,‚Äù he added.¬†
‚ÄoeTerrorism, violence and radicalisation have risen and fundamental rights of the citizens are under danger in the Kashmir Valley,‚Äù Madhav said.
The fact that both PDP and BJP didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t use any harsh words against each other also gave rise to speculations in political circles that the parties are keeping the options of future alliance still open.
If J&K comes under governor rule, it will be for the 8th time in 4 decades. Here are the previous cases:
After Mufti Sayeed‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death, allies PDP and BJP defer govt formation till the end of mourning period.
Assembly elections throw up a hung assembly.
PDP withdraws from Ghulam Nabi Azad-led Congress-PDP coalition govt
Caretaker CM Farooq Abdullah refuses to continue after party‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s defeat in Assembly polls
Farooq Abdullah resigns as CM over appointment of Jagmohan as the Governor¬†
State Congress headed¬†by Sayeed withdraws support to Ghulam Mohammad¬†Shah govt
State Congress headed by Sayeed withdraws support to the minority govt of Sheikh Abdullah of National Conference.
