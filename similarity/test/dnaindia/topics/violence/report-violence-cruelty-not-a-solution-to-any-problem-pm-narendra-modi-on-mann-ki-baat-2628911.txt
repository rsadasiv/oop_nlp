Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday came down heavily on the cult of violence and cruelty. While he was referring to the Jallianwala Bagh incident, the message is being attributed to his disapproval of the recent lynching in Hapur allegedly over cow slaughter and reports on suspected child lifters beaten to death.
"The everlasting message left behind by incidents such as Jallianwala Bagh massacre is that cruelty and violence cannot solve any problem," he said during his monthly radio program "Mann Ki Baat".
Referring to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, next year will be its 100th year, the Prime Minister said people must remember the message it has imparted. "It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that is triumphant in the end."
The PM said the history of India's struggle for independence was very long, very vast and filled with countless sacrifices.
"Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; the guiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon."
Modi went on to weave in the teachings of Guru Nanak and Kabir Das to drive home the point that there is a need to eradicate caste-based discrimination and embrace humanity. He said the 550th 'Prakash Parv' (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in 2019.
Referring to his proposed visit to Maghar in Uttar Pradesh on June 28, Modi said that there was a common belief that death in Maghar was a roadblock in reaching heaven. But Kabir Das preferred to breathe his last there, as he recalled the contribution of 15th-century poet and saint who dispelled this superstition.
He also hailed Bharatiya Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who died under mysterious circumstances during detention on June 23, 1954. He had entered Jammu and Kashmir via Lakhenpur border protesting against the permit system that was mandatory for Indian citizens to visit the state.
Modi said the most important thing for the leader was the integrity and unity of India and for this, at the young age of 52, he sacrificed his life. "Let us forever remember Mookerjee's message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India," he said.
He also recalled Mookerjee's contribution as India's first Industries minister, crediting him for laying a strong foundation for India's industrial development and prepared a solid base. "The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision. Mookerjee's dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere," Modi said. He said besides heavy industries, Mookerjee laid emphasis on the development of MSME, textile and cottage industry.
