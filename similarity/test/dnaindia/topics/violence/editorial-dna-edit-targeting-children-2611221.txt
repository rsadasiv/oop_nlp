The agitators in Kashmir Valley seemed to have lost their moral compass. Their conscience was unperturbed when they pelted a school bus carrying children with stones. If this is insaniyat (humanism), the cornerstone of Kashmiri society, then these are indeed dark days for its peace-loving people. Imagine the plight of the kids ‚Ä" one of whom suffered a serious head injury ‚Ä" when they came under attack. A senseless act of violence has left them traumatised, perhaps for life.
The mother of the 11-year-old Rehan Goursi, who suffered a frontal bone fracture when a stone hit him on the head, spoke on behalf of the citizens, when she said: ‚ÄoeThis is not a human act. We need to keep our children away from it.‚Äù A deeply distressed mother held a mirror up to the protestors in her poignant plea. And, the reflection was ugly, to say the least. The outrage following the attack is understandable. Kashmiris have realised that they can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be living in the shadow of terror while their children become victims to stones and bullets.
The amnesty to stone-pelters ‚Ä" an initiative to reform misguided youth ‚Ä" has been misused, and the Valley is paying a steep price for it. No form of protest, however noble the cause, encourages targeting innocent people, especially children. The stone-pelters in Shopian are goons and deserve to be treated accordingly. Kashmir‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s descent into violence and despair in the past few years has been a huge setback for the peace process. There has been a spurt in militancy along with increased radicalisation of the youth. Tourism, its economic mainstay, has suffered, reducing many families to penury. When it comes to the question of livelihoods, Kashmir, in spite of having tremendous potential, has very little to offer.
The state government has miserably failed to connect with the people as the churning in the Valley becomes even more intense. Though politicians across the spectrum have condoned the incident, they are largely responsible for exploiting the anger of young people for disruptive activities. In Kashmir‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s politics, those who advocate peace are sidelined. But there is hope even in this darkest hour if the silent, peace-loving majority can regain its voice. Goursi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words should inspire other voices to speak up for peace. The fate of a people can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be held hostage forever.
Kashmiris need to decide how soon they want to come out of this spiral of violence. A generation has already suffered the consequences of lost development opportunities, ill health, and social, physical, mental disruption. The success stories originating from the Valley ‚Ä" in civil service examinations, entrepreneurship ‚Ä" are the ideal stepping stones in the quest for normalcy. When years of militancy have brought nothing but bloodshed and despondency, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to explore other alternatives. Pakistan cannot offer any constructive solution because it wants the people of the Valley to wallow in violence and poverty. India can and is willing to lend a helping hand.
