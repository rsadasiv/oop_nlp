The date of hearing of a plea seeking that the State Backward Class Commission expedite work on its report on Marathas has been pushed forward to August 7 from August 14.
The advancement of date came after petitioner Vijay Patil apprised the Bombay High Court about the urgency of the situation, stating that the Maratha community was on the boil. Recently, the state has seen a spate of violence and suicides by protesters seeking reservations in jobs and education.
A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Anuja Prabhudessai is hearing the petition filed Patil, a member of the Maratha Kranti Morcha. The plea states that the commission should expedite the recording of evidence and submit its recommendations at the earliest.
Advocates Vijay Killedar and Leena Patil, who were appearing for the petitioner, said, "Recently there have been incidents of suicide and violence, which shows that the community is getting impatient, and thus, the work needs to be expedited to ensure no untoward incidents happen."
The high court had in November 2014 stayed the state's decision to give 16 per cent reservation to Marathas in public service and educational institutions, citing that the Supreme Court had already laid down that reservation cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total seats or posts.
The backward class commission, which conducted 20 hearings during March and June in all 36 districts of the state, will analyse the data collected by five agencies before compiling its report.
The panel, headed by Justice MK Gaikwad, met on August 3 and will meet on August 4 again to review the status and decide a time line for preparation and submission of the report to the state government.
