Tension prevailed in East Delhi's Trilokpuri area after clashes broke out between two communities over an argument during a cricket match. Police said four locals and four policemen were injured during the clashes while 7 people have been arrested.
Stone pelting and bottle bombs were thrown at each other during the clash, following which the police had to use tear gas to disperse the people. Heavy police force has been deployed in the area.
Locals said the fight started at around 9.30 pm on Thursday when Shoaib Mohammad, a roadside vendor, was passing by a park where a group of men was playing cricket.
"Mohammad was passing by the park and suddenly happened to have a verbal spat with one of the men playing cricket. Within minutes, the argument turned ugly as the other party started throwing bricks, stones, bottle bombs at us," said Shabnam, Mohammad's elder sister.
Trilokpuri block 20 is prone to communal clashes. Locals say that these type of fights often break out between boys of different blocks as communal tension prevails in the area all the time but the incident last night aggravated dangerously leading to serious injuries for people on both the sides.
"My brother was playing in the ground with his friends when he saw some boys drinking alcohol and tried to stop them, which made the drunk boys furious. They threw stones inside our house and brutally injured my brother and uncle. This is not the first time he has been injured. We don't feel safe even inside our homes, " said Pooja, sister of Ankit, who is a suspect in the case.
"Seven have been arrested. Efforts to identify others who fuelled the violence are being made," Pankaj Singh, DCP (East).
