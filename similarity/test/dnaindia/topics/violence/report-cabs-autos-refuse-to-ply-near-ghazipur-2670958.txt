The lockdown of Ghazipur border by thousands of protesting farmers who camped here since Tuesday morning affected cab and auto services in Delhi and the national capital region as a domino effect. The drivers refused to ply to places adjoining Ghazipur, leaving a lot of people inconvenienced.
The Ghazipur border became out of bounds from early Tuesday morning with more than 4,000 thousand cops from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police cordoning off the Delhi-UP border to prevent entry of farmers into the national capital. They wanted the Kisan Kranti March started at Haridwar to against apathetic government, to culminate at Kisan Ghat in Delhi.
As the news of violence at the protesting sight spread like wildfire, drivers of private cab aggregators stopped taking bookings for those headed towards Ghazipur, Ghaziabad or even to localities located nearby citing security reasons and diversion of roads. "Cops are deployed everywhere and we do not have much clarity on the diversions. It also means that commuting time will increase than normal. Hence I have been refusing all bookings to Ghaziabad," said Sushil Tomar, a cab driver. Akram Khan, another taxi driver said, "These protests can get extremely violent. I cannot risk my life for a few hundred rupees."
Rumour mongering also propelled the refusals to ply cabs on these specific routes. Few auto and cab drivers claimed to have heard from their counterparts that taxis have been vandalised. "My friend called me to inform that farmers are damaging cars in Ghazipur. I switched off my device to avoid any booking even though I could have earned some extra bucks owing to surge pricing," Anand Yadav, another driver said.
Meanwhile, people also faced a harrowing time on Tuesday with limited availability of cabs and autos. "Most cabbies were unwilling to travel to Indirapuram. I cancelled as many as 10 bookings from each service provider in a span of 20 minutes," Rajbir Singh Mor, a resident of Sector 62, Noida complained.
