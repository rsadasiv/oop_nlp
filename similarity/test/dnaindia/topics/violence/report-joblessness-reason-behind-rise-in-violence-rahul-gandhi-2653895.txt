In a no holds barred attack on the Modi dispensation during his four-day tour of UK and Germany, Congress president Rahul Gandhi broached issues of mob lynching, attacks on Dalits, women safety, demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and unemployment.
He described demonetisation as one big faulty decision responsible for taking away lakhs of jobs by destroying the cash flow of small and medium businesses.
"China produces 50,000 jobs every 24 hours, India only 450," Gandhi said, adding that bad implementation of GST had let to the closure of thousands of businesses.
"These things have made people in India angry. That is what you get to read in the newspaper. When you hear about lynching in India... when you hear about attacks on Dalits in India... when you hear about attacks on minorities in India, that is the reason for it," Gandhi said.
He said the transition that is shaping the world requires certain protection for people. "That protection is being taken away and India is reacting to that. It is very dangerous in the 21st century to exclude people. If you do not give people a vision in the 21st century, somebody else will which is not going to be good," he said.
Decrying prevalence of violence in India, Rahul said hate is a dangerous thing in a connected world and is a choice.
"I can fight you, take you on. I can compete with you but be hating you is something I have to actively choose to do."
The Congress president called for a change in the attitude of Indian men at the way they treat women. He said the level of violence is increasing in India and "women were getting a huge share of it."
"Non-violence in India was a foundational philosophy of India's nationhood and violence can only be fought by non-violence," Rahul said.
On a question regarding his hug to the PM Modi, Rahul said certain "hateful remarks" made against him by Modi prompted him to do so but "he (Modi) didn't like and was upset by it."
Gandhi also accused the Modi government of not following the path that was laid by the Congress government to smoothen the process of change in the lives of Dalits, tribals and minorities by creating support structures.
"They feel that tribal communities, poor farmers, Dalit, should not get the same benefits as the elite of the country gets...The other thing they have done is they have started attacking the support structures that were designed to help certain groups of people," Rahul Gandhi said.
Blaming the BJP government for weakening the welfare measures of UPA government such as the right to food and the right to guaranteed employment, Rahul alleged the money that was going into these schemes is going into the hands of very few people, the largest corporates in the country.
