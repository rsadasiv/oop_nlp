Speaking to Naipaul about his life and writings was Farrukh Dhondy, his long-time friend and eminent British novelist and scriptwriter, even as his wife, Lady Nadira, sat in a chair behind him, taking notes, holding the microphone when he became too tired to hold it, and prompting the words when he forgot what he was saying or ran out of steam.Â 
He may be old or ill, but Naipaul hasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t run out of steam or his sense of droll. â€oeI donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t like to talk about sunsets,â€ he told Dhondy who suggested, by way of opening line, that they pretend there were sitting in their homes in England, sipping wine and looking at the birds at sunset. â€oeIt can be used against me to infer that I am in the sunset of my life. Unhappy metaphor,â€ Naipaul replied, much to the amusement of the full house at the Rajnigandha Front Lawns.Â 
The conversation, with Dhondy filling in every time Naipaulâ€<sup>TM</sup>s memory of events or anecdotes seemed to fail him, ranged over how Naipaul came to be born in Trinidad (â€oeI can assure you I had nothing to do with it,â€), to how he came to be a writer, his early comic novels set in the Caribbean, the Caribbean authors he admires and the ones he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t, and India, a subject on which Naipaul has written three books - An Area of Darkness (1964), India: A Wounded Civilisation (1977) and India: A Million Mutanies Now (1990).Â All three books were hugely controversial when they came out, with Indian readers taking exception to Naipaulâ€<sup>TM</sup>s unsparing critical eye that homed in on the chaos and dysfunction on the streets, the filth and â€oepublic nuisanceâ€, and the venal hypocrisy of the politicians.
Speaking now, Naipaul says the title â€oearea of darknessâ€ was not a description of India, but a reference to the â€oedark placeâ€, a place that he had never seen but one that had been a presence all his life. As such, Naipaul said he was bewildered by the reaction. â€oeIt was written with a desire to be true to the visual facts. I learnt to live with it.â€ To which his wife added the story about how Naipaulâ€<sup>TM</sup>s mother, who only knew the one Hindi word beta, had told him not to worry about the Indians. â€oeLeave India to the Indians beta,â€ she is supposed to have told him.
Modesty or hindsight, Naipaul also seemed keen to demystify the â€oegreat writerâ€ myth. Writing, he claimed, was as â€oehard for me as it is for most people in the audience. His writing, and the success of his books, he said, were a â€oegreat bit of luckâ€. His first book he wrote, Miguel Street, he said, heâ€<sup>TM</sup>d taken to an English critic who told him to give it up and do something else. The only reason heâ€<sup>TM</sup>d stuck to writing was his â€oeinordinate confidence and faith in my talent. I felt that if I didnt stay true to my talent that would be the end of meâ€.Â
