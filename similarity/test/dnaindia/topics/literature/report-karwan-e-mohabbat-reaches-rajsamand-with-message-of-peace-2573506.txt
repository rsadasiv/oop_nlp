A month after the gruesome murder of Afrazul by Shambhu Lal Regar on December 6 in Rajsamand, social activists and other people from Rajasthan and other parts of India congregated at Rajsamand to form the Rajsamand Insaniyat and Aman Citizensâ€<sup>TM</sup> Committee. The committee pledged to ensure peace and harmony in the district and also to make sure that the basic humanitarian values will be protected under all circumstances.
Eminent Activist Aruna Roy, on the occasion, said that committees like these must be formed across all the districts of Rajasthan and in fact across the entire country. She emphasised upon the need to understand that the composite culture of India cannot even exist if efforts at erasing parts of our language, literature and heritage are not nipped in the bud. She said that the constitutional values on which our nation was formed must be protected and no powers should be allowed to meddle with these values.
It is worth noting that the formation of this committee came in the wake of a nation-wide Karwan-e-Mohabbat which began from Noakhali in Assam and travelled across several states spreading the message of peace, harmony and brotherhood at more than 55 locations where crimes of hatred and violence have taken place in the recent past.
Harsh Mander, who anchored the Karwan-e-Mohabbat expressed his concern over the increasing crimes of hatred and violence and said that the formation of this committee in Rajsamand is actually a victory of love and hope over hatred and violence. Apart from the people of Rajsamand, the event saw the participation of eminent writer Ashok Vajpeyi, Prof Apoorvanand and many others.
