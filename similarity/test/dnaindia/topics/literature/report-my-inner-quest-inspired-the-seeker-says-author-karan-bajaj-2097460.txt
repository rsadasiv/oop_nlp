Your motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s death set you off on the path of a yogi, in turn inspiring The Seeker...
My mother went through a dramatic decline in a span of three years due to cancer. It raised many existential questions in my mind. Yoga and spirituality always pulled me, but they were at the back of my mind. My motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s death brought them forward. It was a major catalyst for my journey, one that made me accept constant change, be it growth, ageing or decay, so you are not attached to the sense of permanence at all. I saw the change happening viscerally during my motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s deteriorating health. It has helped me accept the nature of life.
How did the worlds of writing and spirituality merge for you?
My novel Keep Off the Grass came out in 2008 and, Johnny Gone Down, in 2010. Meditation and yoga happened in 2013 when my wife Kerry and I took a year off to backpack from Europe to India.Â We wanted to develop a more intuitive side to ourselves. We made a lot of decisions spontaneously. The objective was to get rid of attachments and materialist comfort, the desire to plan things out. We met many people during that time who shaped our journey. Interesting and unexpected things happened during that period. All that is reflected in The Seeker.
We did a six-week yoga teacherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s training at Sivananda Yoga ashram, which is 40 kms from Madurai. It is like a forest ashram with bare living accommodations â€" no electricity and no running water. We used to learn yoga from 5am-10pm. We also learnt meditation at a 30-day Vipassana meditation course in the Himalayas.Â The final leg of the journey from where The Seeker emerged happened in Goa and Portugal, where we spent two months each practising everything we learnt and wrote our books.
I had always dreamt of writing a modern version of Gautama Buddhaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s classic quest of enlightenment and transcendence. Siddhartha is my inspiration for the book. I also evolved spiritually and now teach Hatha and Sivananda yoga.
How did your spirituality affect your writing?
The definition of yoga in Patanjaliâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Yoga Sutras is â€<sup>~</sup>chitta vritti nirodhaâ€<sup>TM</sup>, which means it stops fluctuating thoughts. The mind is restless, it constantly goes into the past and future. So yoga and meditation rooted my mind in the present. Their effect on my writing is tremendous. Because you are never truly immersed in the writing be it a scene, a moment, a character. But I could still my thoughts and create the â€<sup>~</sup>fictive dreamâ€<sup>TM</sup>. Â The â€<sup>~</sup>fictive dreamâ€<sup>TM</sup> is a concept when you are in a pact with the reader that you will hook them in a dream-like state in the new world you create.Â 
How is The Seeker different from your earlier novels?
The Seeker is a significant departure from my previous novels, which were about the external journeys and adventures of the protagonists where they are finding their place in the world. The Seekerâ€<sup>TM</sup>s protagonist Maximus Pzoras is on an inner quest trying to find the meaning of existence. The adventure, the external journey is a foil for internal journey. Â Also, I spent a lot of time investing in character development, which I had earlier sacrificed for a fast-paced story.
