Climate change, dwindling natural resources, the need for clean food and healthy eating and living are everywhere. One can no longer be indifferent to it. The Kala Ghoda Art Festival 2018, too, has taken note of it, weaving it across their various sections including food, heritage walks, cinema, visual arts, literature, theatre, music and others. Says Festival Coordinator Nicole Mody, ‚ÄoeWe wanted to send a positive message out and decided to make the Kala Ghoda, green and it just struck ‚Ä" hara ghoda! The way it has translated across all sections is fantastic. Each section head has interpreted it differently,‚Äù she says. While picking the final events from the various entries has been challenging, Nicole says they had a clear idea about the kind of initiatives they wanted to tie up with and people they wanted to work with. ‚ÄoeEverything has come together almost seamlessly,‚Äù she smiles.
