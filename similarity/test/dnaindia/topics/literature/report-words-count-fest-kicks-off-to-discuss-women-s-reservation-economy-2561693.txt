A three-day festival set to begin at the India Habitat Centre from Wednesday, will dwell upon a host of topics through varied genres including art, politics, culture and literature. The Words Count - Festival of Words will hold conversations ranging from Women's Reservation Bill, state of Indian economy, and social media as a new portal into misogyny.
Curated by screenwriter and novelist Advaita Kala, the festival will bring on board eminent personalities from different walks of life including politics, glamour and literature. While the keynote address on the economy will be delivered by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha, actor-politician Gul Panag will speak on social media and misogyny.
The event, which is a new addition to the ongoing "Delhi International Arts Festival", will begin with a discussion among first-time writers, including Shuchi Kalra, Aanchal Bahri, and Dimple Kaul. Other sessions like "Exporting India's Soft Power- Words and More", "Does Social Media Win Elections?", "Has the Media been Modi-fied" among others will form a major part of the festival.
The main objective of the festival, according to Kala, is to stand out from other literature festivals, by celebrating the use of words to promote understanding and civil discourse in the society.
"Several issues are discussed threadbare on TV channels every day but hardly do we arrive at a plausible conclusion. We want to break this practice through this festival and have real conversations which have an equal participation of the audience. "It is all about the exchange of ideas, concepts and ethos while keeping in view the ideological, gender and artistic diversity," Kala added.
"We aim to make people understand the cultural nuances that shape our society. It is essential to have a conversation that allows discussion among people," political and policy professional Dilip Cherian said.
The festival will end on November 24.
