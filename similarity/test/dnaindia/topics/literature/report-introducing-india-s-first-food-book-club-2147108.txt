Our city is laden with libraries and book stores. Going one step further, we have online stores to buy books, making it practically effortless to source them. However, there are some in the city who are still ardent believers in having traditional book clubs.
A fanatic when it comes to food, Rushina Ghildiyal, owner of APB Cook Studio launched #APBFoodBookClub, India's first food book club, earlier this month. ‚ÄoeThe main objective is to create a meeting place for book lovers as well as a platform for publishers and readers to connect in hope of a more dynamic scenario being created for quality food books.‚Äù
A wide variety of literatureGhildiyal was surprised to discover that while such food book clubs were prevailing around the world, none existed in India. In order to bring this unique culinary cum literary experience to India, she decided to launch such a club. ‚ÄoeThe club will focus only on books related to food‚Ä"straightforward recipe book, culinary memoir like mine, food travelogue, food- and health-based books‚Ä<, food fiction, food history, celebrity chef cookbooks and a lot more,‚Äù she shares. With over 1,000 book collections, Ghildiyal says that food books are being published by the dozen.
What you can doGhildiyal, who owns a cooking studio, has various sections dedicated to different aspects of the kitchen‚Ä"from a plethora of books and ingredients that you'd need to actually cooking a lavish dish. The books from this cooking studio will be made available to those interested in reading food literature. Because of this gathering of people to discuss, cook and eat, the venue can be anywhere and at any time.
To begin with, events of the food book club are currently centred on the studio located in Powai, but plans are underway to host such events around the city as well. ‚ÄoeSome of the other activities, which are sure to attract food fiends are book reading‚Ä<s‚Ä<, cooking demonstration‚Ä<s, a cook-up‚Ä< with an author, pot lucks‚Ä<, food walks and a whole lot more,‚Äù says Ghildiyal.
