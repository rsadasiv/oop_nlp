Publishing is an unpredictable business. Even so, one of the trends in the world of books that I discern in 2018 and coming years, is mythology. The space for books based on Indian mythology has grown immensely since the time I wrote the childrenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Mahabharata and In Search of Sita (2009), and I foresee that it will grow even further in the years to come.
This is because in India, people relate a lot to myth; myths form a reference point for our contemporary lives.The success of books in this genre have led to so obscure figures from Indian mythology being brought into the limelight such as Urmila, Menaka, etc. My latest book is on Ghatotkach, and the response to it has been amazing. Reader or publisher fatigue with mythology space hasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t started.Â 
I truly think that the dumbing down of the publishing industry is finally being reversed, and this is a trend that will become more evident in the coming year. Until a few years ago, it was believed that the stupider the book was, the more readers you would get. Now, even the aspirational readers want to be challenged now by what they read. They are no longer satisfied with reading material simply because it is easy to assimilate; they want books that will stimulate their minds.
I also predict that speculative fiction, especially quality speculative fictionâ€"a genre that not many Indians wrote inâ€"will take off in a big way. Short, nano stories will also find their place, but provided the writers find the right format. Another trend that will slowly unfold over the years to come is that of enhanced fictionâ€"audio books and the like, which bring into play the other sensory facilities such as voice, even smell, some say and are interactive. These serve to make reading a complete experience.
Many people in the publishing industry say that literary fiction has had its dayâ€"I agree with this assessment, but with some reservations. It is true that in many ways, literary fiction had become narcissistic and self-obsessed in recent years. Publishers also liked to play it safe; they need to be a little a less cute and a bit more adventurous.In contrast, genre fiction, especially crime fiction, has taken off in a big way in recent years. But even here, we need more of quality and perhaps, less of quantity.Â 
And lastly, translations - which are not a â€<sup>~</sup>trendâ€<sup>TM</sup> exactly, but a lot of it has been happening for some years now. Excellent quality translations from other countries, and other regions of India are becoming more and more available, and this trend will continue to gather pace. What we need here now is a dynamite moveâ€"courses on literary translations, and mentoring by senior translators, particularly for translations among Indian languages, such as Malayalam to Bangla, etc.Â  Â
