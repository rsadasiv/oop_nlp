Anyone whoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s read/seen Harry Potter (or even if they havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t), knows about the character Hermione. She honestly shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have been in Gryffindor because she represents all Hogwartsâ€<sup>TM</sup> houses. Sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s smart, as seen in every single Hogwarts class. Sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s beyond brave, and loyal to the end. She is a feisty girl, never portrayed herself as some kind of a â€<sup>~</sup>princessâ€<sup>TM</sup>, and when Ron (who is basically the love of her life) decides to leave Harry on their mission to destroy Horcruxes, she doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t leave with him because she knows whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s right for the world. Letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not forget to mention she became Minister for Magic. Well, which is basically what Emma Watson is, and even better.Â 
When she finished acting for the Harry Potter series, Emma went on to study at both Brown and Oxford University, graduating from Brown with a Bachelorâ€<sup>TM</sup>s degree in Literature. She then went on to be announced as the UN Goodwill Ambassador â€" a prestige that has been bestowed only to her and four other women in the world. Holding now a real position of power, she prove to the world why she deserved it. When she launched her #HeforShe campaign, she gave a speech that inspired people around the world, and it went viral for all the right reasons. She made us see that feminism was not about women being better, despite the â€<sup>~</sup>feâ€<sup>TM</sup> prefix. It was about equality, and how women were as powerful as men were sensitive. It showed us that gender equality could only be possible if the men of our world were feminists too, and how she needed the support of the other gender to win the battle women have so far been fighting alone.Â 
She letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s people know that women donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have to be damsels in distress. They can be warriors, fighting for what they deserve. She understands that often, strong women who fight for what they believe is right are deemed a â€<sup>~</sup>feminaziâ€<sup>TM</sup> or a â€<sup>~</sup>divaâ€<sup>TM</sup>, but itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all about knowing your cause and doing your best to achieve what you want.Â 
All in all, more then an inspiration to the western world, she is an inspiration to us, the products of a second world country that is willing to broaden their horizon, but is still a little stuck in the past. A country where a working woman with children raises eyebrows and house husbands are unheard of and not just looked down upon. She is a role model for all 12-year-old girls and 25-year-old men alike, because she teaches us what it is to be more than yourself- to fight for a greater cause. Changing mindsets is important, and Emma Watson has set an example for millions.
Emma often asks her fans to donate to charity. Her official website has a link to UNICEF, which she asks people to donate to. She has also provided service for UNICEF and United Nations Women
