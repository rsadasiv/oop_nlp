Nowadays, while younger generations are glued to screens â€" be it smart phones or TV sets, a crusader of the reading movement, Vinayak Ranade is motivating children with 'My Library' â€" a bag of books reaching their homes for them to read.
Wishing to create a habit of reading, the trustee of Kusumagraj Pratishthan initiated the project Grantha Tumchya Dari â€" Books at your door step â€" in February 2009. The initiative entails a bag with 100 books to be distributed in a city or a neighbourhood, or to a senior citizens club, wherein a caretaker assumes responsibility of circulating the books and collecting them back after a certain time period.
Presently, Grantha Tumchya Dari has 555 such bags circulating throughout Maharashtra, Gujrat, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu as well as abroad, in Dubai, Netherlands and Tokyo.
Ranade said that when 'Grantha Tumchya Dari' gained success, it inspired him to start the concept of 'Maze Granthalaya' (My Library), where a person donates contents for a bag of books. "Each bag has 25 books and the borrower can take it home, and then return it after 3 months," he informs.
Launched 2 months ago, My Library has 28 bags in Mumbai, 60 in Nashik and 18 in Pune. A bag contains 25 Marathi books on all subjects and all types of literature genres.
The older age groups are also included, for My Library also has two bags which are circulated with member recommendation for free to a person who is bound at home â€" due to illness or accident.
'My Library for Children' is being launched on Feb 7, and already has 30 bags with donors ready. "The bag for children will have 25 books, including 10 in English and 15 in Marathi," Ranade adds.
The reading crusader said that there is a need to make books available to kids, so that they know 'the treasure hidden in books, and the pleasure reading can give'. "Saying that this generation does not read and doing nothing about it, is like diagnosing a problem but not solving it," he added.
The first bag of books of the My Library for Children will be given to Mai Lele Shravan Vikas Kendra â€" the school for hearing impaired children, free of any donation.
