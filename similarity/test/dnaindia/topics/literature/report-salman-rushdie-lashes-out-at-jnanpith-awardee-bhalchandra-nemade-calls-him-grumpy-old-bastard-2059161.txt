Salman Rushdie on Saturday hit out at Jnanpith award winning Marathi writer Bhalchandra Nemade by calling him a 'grumpy old bastard'.Â 
RushdieÂ lashed out at Nemade after he had slammedÂ Rushdie'sÂ work post the 'Midnight's Children' saying that they were devoid of any literary value.Â â€< This happened on the day Nemade received the prestigious Jnanpith award. Nemade had also said that much work by writers like Rushdie do not have literary merit.
Reacting to it, the Booker of Bookers award winner tweeted, "Grumpy oldÂ bastard. Just take your prize and say thank you nicely. I doubt you've even read the work you attack."

While speaking at his felicitation at the Matrubhasha Samvardhan Sabha, Nemade had also criticised another English literary giant, Sir Naipaul accusing writers like him of 'pandering to the west', say reports.Â 
Endorsing the theory of 'Deshivaad' (nativity), he harshly came down on English language demanding its ban from education in the country. 'make its elimination compulsory' instead of making the language compulsory in the education system, he said. He made a strongÂ case for learning in mother tongue using reports from UNICEF, World Bank and others.
Nemade, who teaches English and comparative literature at also added that he is not opposed to learning English, but its mandatory use in educational institutions.Â 
The 77 year old writer had got India's highest literary award for Hindu: Jagnyachi Samrudhha Adgal, a magnum opus quartet. Â Â
