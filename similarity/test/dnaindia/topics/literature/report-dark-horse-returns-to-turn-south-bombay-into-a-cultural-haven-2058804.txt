It's that time of the year again, when South Bombay will transform into a hub of art, music theatre and more. The much-awaited 16th edition of the annual Kala Ghoda Art Festival (KGAF) begins today, and its going to be bigger and better.
To be held over the next nine days, KGAF will incorporate its theme 'Sparsh' (touch/ feeling) and in all its 12 sections. The festival is said to be inaugurated by Amitabh Bachchan.
With more then 350 events and over 30 workshops, the festival is free of cost. Also planned are heritage walks and a walk dedicated to Mumbai's iconic cinema theatre halls. You can take classes on erotic art, and mystery as well as romance writing, or learn to create a vertical garden. The newest section this year is stand-up comedy, which will be held at Irish House.
Brenda Miller, festival director and committee member said that one of the highlights of the festival is the symphony orchestra of India, where 70 western classical musicians will perform together tomorrow. The program finale will have performances by music composer Amit Trivedi and Blackstrap blues. "We are seeing more children and teenagers than ever before and its a good sign. Earlier we had to beg people to perform at our shows but now many talented artists have begun approaching us. Thus, the quality has improved too," said Miller.
The proceeds generated from KGAF will be directed towards the upkeep, maintenance and restoration of the heritage art precinct.
