Extending the gambit of reservation in jobs for special categories, the central government has included victims of acid attacks, people with autism and mental illness also in the list.
The move to enhance reservation quota for those with learning disability and acid attack victims comes after passage of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and the notification of relevant rules in this regard.
As per the latest order or Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), four per cent of the total number of vacancies, up from the existing three per cent, in groups A, B and C shall be reserved for people with benchmark disabilities, in case of direct recruitment. Benchmark disability refers to a having not less than forty per cent of a specified disability.
DoPT has recently written to all central departments to ensure that one per cent of each posts be reserved for people with blindness and low vision; deaf and hard of hearing; locomotor disability including cerebral palsy, leprosy cured, dwarfism, acid attack victims and muscular dystrophy.
One per cent posts each shall be also reserved for people suffering from autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability and mental illness, it said.
As per an earlier order of the DoPT, issued in 2005, three per cent of the total posts were to be reserved for people with disabilities.
Of these one per cent each was for those with blindness or low vision; hearing impairment and locomotor disability or cerebral palsy.
Under the new rules, all government organisations have been asked to appoint â€<sup>~</sup>grievance redressal officersâ€<sup>TM</sup> to look into complaints.
The grievance officers will maintain a register of complaint carrying details.
The government has included victims of acid attacks, people with autism and mental illness in the special categories. This follows the passage of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
