Singer Demi Lovato, who has been dealing with bipolar disorder for several years, thinks it is okay to have a mental illness.
The 22-year-old singer launched her own campaign aimed at tackling the negative stigma against mental illness, reported People magazine.
"I just think mental illness is something people need to learn more about. I want people to know it's okay to ask for help and it's okay to have a mental illness," she said.
The chart-topping performer, who was diagnosed as bulimic, bipolar and addicted to drugs and alcohol in 2011, explained that her father, Patrick, suffered from similar illnesses before he passed away in 2013.
"I watched him live a very unfortunate life because of the lack of access to treatment," she said.
