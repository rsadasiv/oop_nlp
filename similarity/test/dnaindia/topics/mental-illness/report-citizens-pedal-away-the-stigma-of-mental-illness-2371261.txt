Over 1,200 citizens pedaled on the city‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s streets with a ¬†common cause to spread awareness about mental well-being on Sunday morning. In the second edition of the Aditya Birla Health Ride to MPower, cyclists complete a 15 to 35km ride which starts from NCPA, to raise awareness.
A cycle ride initiative by MPower highlighted that physical fitness is as important as mental well-being.
‚ÄoeAt Mpower, we are constantly working towards spreading mental health awareness and we believe large scale events like these are critical in bringing about a mindset change. We are delighted that so many Mumbaikars came together to support us for this ride. What we achieve mentally will play a major role in changing our outer reality and as a society we must realise the importance of that and move towards a complete well-being‚Äù, said Neerja and Ananya Birla.
Mayank Bathwal, CEO Aditya Birla Health, said, ‚ÄoeMental health and awareness is crucial today and it must be welcomed without any stereotypes and preconceived notions in the society. Having seen Mumbaikars ride towards stamping out stigma and supporting our cause makes us believe that we have achieved a milestone towards promoting philosophy of health first in health insurance.‚Äù
