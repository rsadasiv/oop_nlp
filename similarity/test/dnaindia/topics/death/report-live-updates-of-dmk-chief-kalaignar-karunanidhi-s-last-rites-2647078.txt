DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi was laid to rest on Wednesday on the Marina beachfront as his party supporters as well as a galaxy of political leaders bid him a farewell. The 5-time Tamil Nadu Chief Minister was buried at the Chennai landmark, next to his mentor Annadurai after an unsavoury courtroom battle his party won.
The country's high and mighty descended on the city to pay their last respects to the Kalaignar, who left an indelible imprint on Tamil Nadu's public life over decades through his literary, cinematic and political achievements.
The 94-year-old leader had breathed his last at a hospital in Chennai after fighting for life for 11 days.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, and his Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh counterparts Pinarayi Vijayan, K Chandrasekhar Rao and N Chandrababu Naidu paid their last respects to the Dravidian leader.Â  He had not made any public appearance for about two years due to failing health.
The Madras High Court on Wednesday paved the way for the burial of the DMK chief at Anna Memorial on Marina beach. A huge row erupted after the state's AIADMK government rejected the demand of the DMK, its long-standing political rival in state politics, for land on the famed sands of the Marina beach where he could be buried.
The government was reluctant about allotting space for Karunanidhi's burial at the Marina as he was not a sitting Chief Minister.
Former chief minister M G Ramachandran and his protegee J Jayalalitha are buried at the Marina beach and memorials to them were erected there. Both were bitter foes of Karunanidhi in politics.

We have lost a deep-rooted mass leader, prolific thinker, accomplished writer and a stalwart whose life was devoted to the welfare of the poor and the marginalised," Modi said in a series of tweets.
â-º Congress president Rahul Gandhi also took to Twitter to condole Karunanidhi's death. "Loved by the Tamilian people, Kalaignar strode the stage of Tamil politics, like a colossus, for over 6 decades. In his passing, India has lost a great son. My condolences to his family as also to the millions of Indians who grieve for their beloved leader tonight," he said on Twitter.
