Early on Saturday morning an accident took place in Chomu area of the city when a bike crashed into a truck while travelling on the national highway. The accident resulted in the death of two people while two others were injured and are being treated in hospital. A seven-year-old girl and a twentyfive-year-old youth are among the deceased. The cops are trying to find out why four members of a family were travelling on a bike on the highway.
According to police, the four members have been identified as Mukesh (25), Maina alias Sona (6), Kalu (5) and Kailashi (25). ‚ÄoeMukesh and Maina died in the accident after sustaining head injuries. All the four victims are natives of Todaraisingh town of Tonk district,‚Äù said Jogendra Singh, Station House Office Chomu police station.
Around 10 am, the four members were travelling on a bike and crossing the Barala Radhaswami Baag on national highway 52 passing through the Chomu area. ‚ÄoeWhile they were on the bike, Mukesh was driving the vehicle at a good speed. They were trailing a truck and were quite close to the vehicle. However, this proved to be costly as the truck driver braked suddenly and Mukesh could not keep the vehicle under control and as a result it crashed into the truck from behind,‚Äù officials said.
As the accident occurred, the truck driver heard the sound of the bike crashing in the vehicle. ‚ÄoeThe driver came out of the truck and as he saw that an accident has occurred, he left the victims to their fate and ran from the spot on foot. Meanwhile, locals from the area responded on hearing the crash and rushed to the aid of the victims.¬†
