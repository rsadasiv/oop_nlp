Police questioned a 19-year-old taekwondo player after the crew of an AirAsia flight found a lifeless foetus in one the lavatories shortly before it landed at Delhi airport from Guwahati on Wednesday afternoon.
On being alerted, police officials reached the aircraft that docked at Terminal 3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Police also had the woman medically examined and sent the body, which had toilet paper stuffed in its mouth, for post-mortem examination. Police has registered a case of death on the flight.
"A doctor from the airport's medical team confirmed the delivery happened in the aircraft. Suspect has been held back by police for further investigation. She was identified on questioning of all female passengers," the airline said in a statement.
Police is investigating if the pre-mature delivery happened because of low air pressure in the flight. She said the foetus belonged to her. The woman had boarded flight I5 784 from Guwahati after it had originated from Imphal.
The matter has also been reported to aviation regulator DGCA. "We will be assisting in the investigation and cooperating with all agencies concerned," the airline said.
"AirAsia India would like to apologise to all guests experiencing disruptions in their flight schedule," the airline said.
AirAsia India, a low-cost carrier, is a joint venture between Malaysia's AirAsia Berhad and Indian conglomerate Tata Sons.
