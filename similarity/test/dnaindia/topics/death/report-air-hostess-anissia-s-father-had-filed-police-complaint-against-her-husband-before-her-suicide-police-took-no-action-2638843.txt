The 39-year-old flight attendantÂ Anissiaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s father, a Retired Major General RS Batra in his complaint to the police on June 27, 2018,Â had stated that he was filing the report as a precautionary against any harm which may come to his daughter from a husband or her in-laws to her safety or well-being.Â 
Anissia had allegedly jumped to death from the terrace of her residence on Friday.Â 
â€oeHe is a violent man. Ever since their marriage he has been using physical force and beating her up. We have been keeping the matter quiet to keep the marriage alive but now his violence is becoming more frequent and has come to a stage where the husband and in-laws asked her to vacate her husbandâ€<sup>TM</sup>s house (N-116, Panchsheel park),â€ said Retired Major General RS Batra in his complaint to the police on June 27, 2018.Â 
The apprehensions of the father are quite evident in the letter in which he further requests for a secure telephone number in case of an emergency to protect her life.
â€oeI also fear to her safety as her life could be in danger. Also they may physically harm my daughter and show it as an accident or suicide. Kindly note that any harm to her well being directly attributed to plans made by my son-in-law and his parents. I am asking for your help and advise,â€ stated the complaint.Â 


Ishkaran Singh Bhandari, Lawyer for Anissia Batra said â€oeSince the family is influential the police did not even summon the accused on the earlier complaint. They also did not file any case and today she is no more.â€
Before her death, Anissia had sent to her friend on WhatsApp in which she said, "He has locked me up, I need you to call the police, Plz come if you can, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m locked up,"
