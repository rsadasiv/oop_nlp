In yet another incident of mobocracy, a man was beaten to death on suspicion of smuggling cows in Alwar district of Rajasthan, leaving his family shattered.
The incident took place on Friday when Akram Khan and another man were taking two cows to their village in Haryana through a forest area near Lalawandi in Alwar district, when a group of people severely thrashed Khan.
The victim, along with his friend Aslam went to take a cow with a cash of Rs 60,000 from Khanpur village in Alwar district of Rajasthan. While returning, when he reached near Alawadi village, the cow fell from the bike and escaped. Akram and his friend Aslam went to capture the cow from cotton fields where a mob thrashed both of them. Taking advantage of the darkness and the harvest, Aslam survived, but Akram lost his life.
Akram's killing has destroyed the world of his family including his seven children whose responsibility now lies with his wife Asamina. The children did not know that their goodbye to father while leaving home would be for the last time.
Akram's elder daughter Sahila is 14-years-old, and the youngest daughter Ashera is 2-years-old.
"The goons should be sentenced to death. What is the harm in bringing milk cow? Our world is completely destroyed after Akram's death," said the deceased wife Asamina.
"We want justice. The culprits should be arrested soon," said the victim's father Suleman.
The police have arrested two men - Dharmendra Yadav and Paramjeet Singh Sardar - even as Rajasthan chief Minister Vasundhara Raje promised stern action in the case.
Prima facie, Khan died due to internal injuries and it was under investigation whether he and Aslam had any past record of cow smuggling, said Hemant  Priyadarshini, Jaipur range Inspector General.
According to the villagers and eyewitnesses, the goons rob the cattle and sell them.
This is not the first case in Rajasthan, so far, more than half a dozen people have died in the incidents of mobs lynching.
A case has been registered against unidentified people under IPC Section 302, Ramgarh police station SHO Subhash Sharma said.
Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria promised strict action against those responsible. 
"There is no guarantee that if we bring a provision of capital punishment for murder then there will be no murder. But we're trying to make laws stricter," Kataria said.
The incident comes a little more than a year after Pehlu Khan, a dairy farmer from Haryana's Mewat, was lynched by cow vigilantes in Alwar. He was attacked when he was transporting cattle to his village in Haryana as the mob suspected him of smuggling cows. 
On July 1, a mob had lynched five tribals in Reinpada village in Maharashtra's Dhule after rumours on social media about the possibility of child lifters in the area.
Last month in Maharashtra, two men were beaten to death and seven others were injured after a mob of villagers attacked them on suspicion of being robbers in Chandgaon village in Vaijapur taluka on June 8. The lynching was triggered by fake messages in circulation on the social media.
Before that, in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, two people were pulled out of their vehicle at and beaten to death by a group of irate villagers, who suspected them to be child-lifters on the basis of fake information circulated on social media.
