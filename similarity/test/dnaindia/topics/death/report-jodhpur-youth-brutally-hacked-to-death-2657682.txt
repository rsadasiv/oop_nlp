He left his salon in Jodhpur city around 8:00 pm Thursday night. That was the last time he was seen alive. On Friday, police recovered Rakesh Sainâ€<sup>TM</sup>s dead body laced with multiple cuts from the Mandalnath-ITBP Road that skirts the Jodhpur city. A young hairdresser, he ran a salon in Jodhpur, and was found brutally murdered, his throat slit with what police are suspecting to be a sharp blade.
Not far from the city, in Diejar, lives headmaster of government school, Kaluram Sain. His younger son Rakesh who was 32 years of age owned a salon in the city. He would bike up and down his home every day from the salon, police said. On Thursday, like any other day, he was last seen by locals riding out of the salon on his bike.Â 
That was the last eyewitnesses would see him alive.Â Â 
Police recovered his body in mutilated condition along an abandoned patch on the Mandalnath-ITBP Road. The place is not far from the salon. â€oeLess than a kilometer,â€ says an investigating official. Anxious family members had approached the cops after Rakesh failed to turn up home on Thursday. The search began Friday morning and by noon had ended with the recovery of Rakeshâ€<sup>TM</sup>s body.
â€oeHis throat was slit like an animalâ€<sup>TM</sup>s. There was blood all over,â€ the police said. What surprised the police was the hate that had driven the murderer into committing the gory act. â€oeThere are a dozen cuts on his body, all made by a sharp object,â€ a cop said.Â  The post-mortem has been conducted on the deceasedâ€<sup>TM</sup>s body and a case of murder has been registered with the Karvad police station.
Empty liquor bottles at the crime scene and the bloodied clothes tell a tale of struggle before the victim was overpowered by his killers. â€oeIf the victim has had liquor with the killers, then he knew them. We are working on that angle. The motive is yet not clear,â€ an official said.
