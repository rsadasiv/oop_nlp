The deaths of three minor girls because of 'starvation' has triggered a political storm in the national Capital on Thursday with the opposition holding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government responsible for the incident and the latter passing the buck to the Centre and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for "blocking" its "doorstep ration delivery" scheme.
Members of both the BJP and the Congress raised the matter in the Lok Sabha claiming that subsidised grain was not reaching the poor in Delhi. "The area where the incident occurred falls in Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's constituency. And, the AAP government only indulges in a blame game," said BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri in Parliament.
However, Congress members in the Lok Sabha blamed both the AAP and the BJP for the deaths saying that they cannot "wash their hands" of the incident. "It is unfortunate that Delhi being the Capital of one of the most powerful countries of the world has had to see starvation deaths. It is absolutely unacceptable," said Congress MP Deepender Hooda.
The AAP government, on its part, said that the Delhi government's attempts to introduce the doorstep delivery of ration to the poor was being blocked by the BJP and Lt-Governor. It has also announced a compensation of Rs 25,000 for the family. The Delhi BJP unit also announced Rs 50,000 support to the family of the children.
The Delhi government had on Wednesday ordered a magisterial probe into the matter. "The Delhi government is trying to implement the doorstep delivery of ration, but the BJP and the LG have been stopping it," said AAP spoeskperson and MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj.
Earlier in the day, the presidents of both Delhi BJP and state Congress -- Manoj Tiwari and Ajay Maken, respectively --- visited the family and met the mother of the children. "Where was the Aam Aadmi canteen which was promised wherein the poor was supposed to get a meal for Rs 10?" The Congress leader added that if people living in Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's constituency could meet such a fate, "imagine what would be the everyday challenges faced by people living in other areas."
