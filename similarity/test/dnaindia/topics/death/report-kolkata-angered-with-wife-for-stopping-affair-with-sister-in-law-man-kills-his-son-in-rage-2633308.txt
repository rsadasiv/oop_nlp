In a shocking incident, a man in West Bengal has been accused of killing his own toddler son as it was coming in the way of having an affair with his sister-in-law. Sadhu Dolui, a resident of Haroa in West Bengal has been accused of killing his son and trying to murder his wife, reports Zee 24 Ghanta. 
According to report, Dolui got involved in a physical relationship with his sister-in-law from the time his wife was pregnant. The liaison continued even after his son was born. By then, his wife had got a hint of the affair and tried to stop it. This angered Dolui who reportedly killed his son in a fit of rage. He even tried to kill his wife by forcefully feeding her kerosene. Currently, Sadhu Dolui's wife is hospitalised and is in critical condition.  The incident happened in Kolkata's Katatala area. 
Both had married last year. But very soon Sadhu Dolui got involved in the extra-marital affair which continued unabated. This lead to conflict in the family which reached a crescendo on Wednesday. During the argument, Sadhu Dolui lost cool and hit his 1.5 years son with a hard object, who was lying in the bed. The baby died instantly. Later, Sadhu Dolui tried to kill his wife too who was saved by neighbours. The body of the child has been sent for postmortem. Sadhu Dolui is currently absconding. Police have launched a manhunt for him.
