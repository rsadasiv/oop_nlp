At least three people are feared to have drowned at Juhu Chowpatti near Godrej Bungalow on Thursday evening after five persons were swept away during high tide. One of them was rescued by lifeguards, and another was declared brought dead at Cooper Hospital. The Navy has mobilised a chopper to search for the rest, and the Coast Guard will deploy its chopper on Friday morning.

According to BMC's disaster cell, the incident occurred at around 5.19 pm when the group ventured into the sea for a swim. There was a 3.75-metre high tide at 5.16 pm.
