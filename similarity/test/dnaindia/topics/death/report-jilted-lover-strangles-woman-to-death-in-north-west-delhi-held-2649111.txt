A man murdered a 27-year-old woman, who refused to leave her husband, in North-West Delhi's Bhalswa Dairy area on Saturday afternoon. The woman's one-year-old son was also in the house when the incident took place. The jilted lover was arrested by the police.
According to the police, a PCR call was received around 2 pm from the husband of the woman regarding the suicide but later it was revealed that the woman was strangulated. Her husband, a vegetable vendor would often come in the afternoon for lunch. When he came home on Saturday, he found his wife lying unconscious and informed the police. Her post-mortem examination revealed that she was strangled. Her husband also informed the police about a man identified as Ravi who was troubling his wife. The woman's parents were coming to see her but were shocked to know that she was murdered.
Police officials searched the residence of Ravi but he was found to be missing. The police team later tracked him down and he was arrested. "Ravi confessed to having killed her. During the interrogation, he told the police that he was in love with the woman and followed her all the time. He tried to convince her to leave her husband and marry him but she would refuse," said a police officer.
Ravi kept on trying and later planned to kill her. Since he followed her all the time, he was aware that her husband a vegetable vendor would leave in the morning and come back only in the afternoon. Taking advantage of the situation, he went to her house post noon and strangled her to death. Ravi hails from Aligarh.
"A case of murder has been registered. Further investigations are underway," said the officer.
