The prosecution on Wednesday filed an application before the Special Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act (POCSOA) court pleading the court to allow it to examine a new witness in serial molester Ayyaz Ansari's case. The court on Tuesday allowed the prosecution to frame charges against Ansari under which death penalty is the maximum sentence. The new witness is an investigating officer from an earlier case in which the court had convicted him.
Special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma made the application after the court convicted Ayaz Ansari for raping a minor in 2014. Ansari is already serving a life imprisonment awarded to him in 2017. Ansari has allegedly molested 25 minor girls, out of which only 13 were reported to the police.
Geeta Sharma said, "We need to prove the fact that the accused is a serial offender, and the court in earlier cases have convicted him for the same."
According to the prosecution's case, the accused in the year 2014, was tracking the victim, who then was of 14 years, and was keeping a regular tab on the victim's schedule. On April 9, 2014, when the victim was walking back home from her school, the accused called her and introduced himself as her father's friend.Â 
On the pretext of sharing his contact number with her, the accused asked her to accompany him to a building. On reaching the spot, the accused forced himself on her and raped her.
The child escaped somehow and informed about the incident to the watchman of the building, where the accused had raped her, who accordingly informed the police.
Ansari is already serving a life imprisonment awarded to him in 2017. Ansari has allegedly molested 25 minor girls, out of which only 13 were reported to the police.
