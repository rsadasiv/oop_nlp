The Mishra family from Shastri Nagar alleges medical negligence after their son died at a government hospital on Monday. An FIR has been registered in the case.
According to the family, the doctor misjudged Mishra's condition and told the family that he was fine except a few fractures after he met with an accident. The family members registered an FIR against the hospital before taking his body to the Nigambodh Ghat for the last rites.
Vikas Kumar Mishra, a resident of North-west Delhi's Shastri Nagar, was hit by an Eco car around 8 pm on Sunday evening when he was crossing the road. After a lot of delays, Mishra was taken to the government-run Sushrut Trauma Centre in Civil Lines, where he was admitted at 11 pm.
"He was talking to everyone and was fine when he was admitted. The doctors also said that the CT-scan showed only waist and wrist fractures. Despite us repeatedly asking if there is any major internal injury, we were told till 1 am that he was out of danger," said Amit Kumar, Mishra's cousin.
As per the family, around 2 am, Mishra's condition worsened and the doctor, who came for the second round of examination, determined that his ribs were broken too, which had affected his lungs. The family was not informed about the broken ribs earlier. His condition kept worsening in the wee hours on Monday and he died at 6 am.
"Our doctors did whatever best they could in the time they had. At least five ribs were broken, which must have affected his lungs and heart. There was a lot of internal bleeding and we had to give him four bottles of blood. Around 2 am, he had a cardiac arrest in which he was revived by the doctors, but there was another arrest at 5:30 am, which proved fatal," said Dr Ajay Behl, medical superintendent, Sushrut Trauma Centre.
