A 17-year-old youth was stabbed to death outside a school in suburban Bhandup today, police said.
Sushil Verma, the victim, was attacked with sharp-edged weapons when he came out of the school this afternoon.
He was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival, said a police officer.
It is suspected that an altercation regarding a girl led to the attack, he said.
Three men were detained in connection with the incident, the officer said, adding that some minors too could be involved in the attack.
A case under IPC section 302 (murder) has been registered and further probe is on.Â
