The National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) has issued a notice to the Centre and Delhi Government over the death of three minor sisters in the national capital due to starvation
The three minor sisters who were found dead in east Delhi's Mandawali area were "visibly malnourished" when they were brought to a hospital.
The girls, aged eight, four and two, were brought to the LBS Hospital in Mayur Vihar by their mother and a friend at around 1 pm on Tuesday. The hospital authorities later declared them brought dead.
Doctors said that the autopsy showed that their 'stomachs were empty as if they had not eaten for over a week.
Medical Superintendent of LBS Hospital Dr Amita Saxena said that there were no injury marks. It looked like a typical case of malnutrition, with disheveled, monkey-like faces and no trace of fat in the bodies." "The stomach, bladder and rectum were found empty," she said about the post-mortem.
Saxena said the experts did not suspect any foul play, as there was "no food in the stomach. It was as if they they had not eaten anything for 8-9 days".
According to family members, the two sisters were vomiting due to diarrhoea. 
The girls family had moved to Mandawali a few days back and they were living with a relative after earlier landlord removed them from the house due to lack of money.
Their father, Mangal, is a rickshaw-puller, but some people had reportedly taken away his rickshaw a few days ago, and since then there was no work for him. The family is financially weak.
However, Mangal, who went out in search of work has not returned yet, whereas, the minors mother is mentally challenged.
