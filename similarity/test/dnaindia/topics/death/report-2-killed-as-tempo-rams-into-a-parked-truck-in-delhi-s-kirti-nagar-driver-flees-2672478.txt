According to the cops, the deceased have been identified as Haider Ali, 33, and Chand Babu, 21, both residents of Sangam Vihar.
Family members of the deceased said that Ali had left for Azadpur Mandi in the tempo around 5 am on Saturday. He was accompanied by his friend Chand Babu, and Taufiq, who was driving the tempo.Â 
Aliâ€<sup>TM</sup>s younger brother had kidney problems and due to the increasing cost of treatment, Ali would leave for work early to clock in more hours so he could bear the medical expenses.Â  â€oeAccording to an eyewitness, the accident took place around 5.30 am when the tempo rammed into the back of the truck, which was parked dangerously at Dhaula Kaun.
