A 54-year-old nun's body has been found in a well inside a convent in Kerala's Kollam.
The incident came to notice after workers at the Mount Tabor Convent saw blood stains near the well.
According to reports, the nun has been identified as Susan Mathew.
Mathew was a teacher at St. Stephens School in Kollam's Pathanapuram, where she had been teaching for 12 years.
Police are on the spot and the matter is being investigated.
Both the school and the Convent, is run by the Kottayam-headquartered Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church.
Congress leader Bindu Krishna termed the death shocking. "Blood stains were found inside her room and her hair was also found cut, according to reports," she claimed.
An impartial probe is essential, she said.
