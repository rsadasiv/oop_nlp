A man was allegedly beaten to death by locals in Bihar's Vaishali on charges of robbery.
40-year-old Mohammed Riyaz was thrashed on July 4 in Manpura village. Upon knowing of the incident, the family, who was in Kolkata, requested the police to keep the body until they arrive.
However, the family of the deceased alleged that the police conducted the post-mortem and cremated the man without informing them.
"We were in Kolkata and asked them to keep the body. But later when we came to the police station, we were informed that the body has been buried," said the mother.
Furious over the same, the deceased's family staged a protest earlier in the day alleging negligence on the part of the police.
The protest resulted in roads being jammed as the vehicular movement came to a halt.
