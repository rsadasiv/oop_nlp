Noted Bollywood production house Yash Raj Films has been grabbing the eyeballs recently due to the sexual harassment allegations against their Talent and Business Head - Ashish Patil, in the wake of the #MeToo movement which has taken the film fraternity by storm. In a #MeToo expose, an anonymous survivor has opened up on social media about her disturbing encounter with Ashish Patil, sharing the details of her ordeal.
In the wake of the allegations, while YRF has sacked Ashish, the Twitterati are visivly enraged and are now urging popular YRF talents like Anushka Sharma, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana and Parineeti Chopra to take a strong stand.
In a Twitter trend 'Ashish Patil', netizens demanded that B-Town's gen-next stars voice a strong opinion on the #MeToo movement.  While India has woken up to take a strong stand in support of #MeToo , with Bollywood trend setters like Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Kajol, Kangana Ranaut and others who have disassociated themselves with those who're allegedly accused of sexual harassment, Bollywood's gen-next steers clear from voicing their opinion on the issue. 
Rapist Ashish Patil was allowed to run YRF talent for such a long time. Anushka, Ranveer, Arjun Kapoor, Ayushman, Parineeti have a lot to answer. https://t.co/B4ZvuXKVS4
Ashish Patil is controlling his twitter account by using it in protected mode. If he had only controlled his 1-inch , this wouldn't have happened.#metoo

India's very own Me Too movement has hit Bollywood, unraveling some of B-Town's most dirty secrets and exposing industry heavy weights. The latest one to join the line is the gut wrenching expose of YRF Talent and Business Head - Ashish Patil. Known to be one of the most influential names running the show at Yash Raj Films, Ashish Patil has been accused by a woman with allegations of sexual exploitation. 
An anonymous survivor has taken solace of social media to share her story of sexual harassment at workplace. An activist first tweeted about the survivor's story with her consent, sharing the disturbing encounter with Ashish Patil inside YRF office premises. This led to the accused being sent on an administrative leave. 
The survivor claimed to approach Ashish Patil for work when she was allegedly asked for sexual favours on the pretext of landing her a job. Post the empty promises of giving her work, the girl exposed the industry heavy weight that lead to him being sacked by YRF.

The impact of #MeToo movement had put immense pressure on YRF, who on Tuesday, in a statement said, "Yash Raj Films terminates the services of Mr. Ashish Patil: Vice President Brand Partnerships and Talent Management & Business and Creative Head Y-Films, with immediate effect."
