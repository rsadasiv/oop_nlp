Netflix unleashed the first official trailer for Narcos: Mexico (technically its first season of Narcos: Mexico, and not the fourth season of Narcos) on Thursday.
The 2.27-minutes-long video gives a glimpse into the birth of Mexican drug war and prepares followers of the show for the tonal change in upcoming season.
The split screen shots, Grandmaster Flashâ€<sup>TM</sup>s iconic 'White Lines' song in the background elevate this new season from the sombre tones of previous three seasons that took place in South America, especially Colombia.
Rogue One star Diego Luna plays Mexican drug lord Felix Gallardo. Michael Pena plays an undercover DEA agent Kiki Camarena. The new season will explore the origins of the modern drug war by going back to its roots, beginning at a time when the Mexican trafficking world was a loose and disorganized confederation of independent growers and dealers. The audience will witness the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s.

The only connection between previous seasons of the show and this one isÂ JosÃ© MarÃ­a Yazpik who played Amado Carrillo Fuentes in the last season.Â 
Alejandro Edda is playing Joaquin 'Chapo' Guzman ie El Chapo in his earlier days. This means, that the story of Narcos: Mexico can take the route to show the rise of the infamous drug lord.
