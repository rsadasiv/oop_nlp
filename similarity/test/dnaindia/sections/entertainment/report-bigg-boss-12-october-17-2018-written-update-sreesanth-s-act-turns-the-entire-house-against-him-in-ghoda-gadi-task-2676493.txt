The episode begins with Bigg Boss announcing the end of the luxury bdget task for the day as Romil Chaudhary was still on the treadmill as the ghoda. Sreesanth says that he will leave the house and Somi Khan and Urvashi Vani say that itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll be good only if he leaves the house since there will be less competition for them. Deepak Thakur and Jasleen Matharu have a talk and he tells her about the decision of Romil and others of making Somi the contender for captaincy. Urvashi discusses with Sourabh Patel as to why should they always make Somi the contender for captaincy.
Sreesanth says heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s watching everyone and says that they should play the game and he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to continue playing. The bell for the store room rings as Bigg Boss has sent mattresses and sheets for those playing the horses, since theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re required to sleep in the garden area for the night. Deepak announces the same in front of the housemates.
Sreesanth runs and climbs the jail roof, attempting to escape from the Bigg Boss 12 house. Dipika Kakar and Shivashish Mishra run behind him and try to stop him from fleeing. Shivashish tells Sree that he looks up to him and that he shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t leave like that.
Just then, Urvashi and Deepak start having an argument over their egos. Saba Khan also intervenes and asks Deepak Thakur why should always Urvashi listen to him and try to understand his point of view, why canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t he for once, try to speak to her and understand her views.
On the other hand, Surbhi Rana comes to pacify Sreesanth but ends up getting irked with him. Sreesanth asks Bigg Boss to eliminate him but in vain. Sree comes down and enters the house to use the bathroom. Bigg Boss announces that as per the rules of the task, apart from the sanchalaks (Dipika and Deepak) nobody else is supposed to enter the house. Sreesanth comes out in the garden area and starts running when Dipika tells him not to do what heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s thinking of doing (i.e., leave the house). Sreesanth takes a few pillows and sits near the exit gate.
Sreesanth seems visibly upset with Surbhi. Surbhi starts singing the song Lakdi Ki Kathi in a sarcastic way, aiming at Sree. Sree says he knows a lot about everyone else in the house. Sree tells Anup Jalota that he wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t forgive anyone who tries to mess with Dipikaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s carrots.
Jasleen Matharu tells Romil that till now everyone has played for making Saba and Somi the contenders for captaincy for the past three weeks. Now if this time again they will support them over her for being the contender for captaincy, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll hurt her. Saba intervenes and an argument ensues between her and Jasleen. Jasleen says Saba has the ego that she can handle her contendership by herself and doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t need anybody elseâ€<sup>TM</sup>s support.
Late around 1 am at night, Jasleen is speaking with Saba and Somi and says who is Romil to decide who will be the contender for captaincy? Jasleen says that Romil is at fault for giving word to Saba and Somi from her side that she will support the Khan sisters, without even asking her for once. An argument follows over the same between Jasleen, Romil and Deepak.
Saba has a word with Romil and then comes to Shivashish to say that if Jasleen wants to be the contender, they should all give their carrots to Jasleen. Jasleen is mighty upset and says she doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t need anyone and wants to play on her own. Sree and Dipika are having a chat about the game. In another corner in the garden, Shivashish and Karanvir Bohra are talking about trying to work out a deal for the task.
Next day, in the morning around 7 am, Deepak sees that everyone else is sleeping and takes the horse cap which the contestants are supposed to wear while performing the task from Dipika's side and goes inside the house to hide it in the washroom, saying that itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a strategy.
At 8:30 am, Deepak and Anup Jalota chat about how things should go forward in the task now. KV is guarding his carrots along with Sree. Just then the wake up song Romeo Naam Mera Chori Hai Kaam Mera plays and the rest of the housemates wake up too.
At 9 am, Deepak goes to Saba and says that KV will be the one running like mad today and Shiv will also run today. KV tells Jasleen that he wants to win with maturity. Jasleen says he wants to break the groupism.
Deepak is in the loo, further hiding the cap of the horse. Deepak tells Surbhi that he has hidden the horse cap of Dipika's team and without the cap, no one can walk on the treadmill as per the rules. Surbhi says that he shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have told her that. KV and Dipika discover that their horse cap has been stolen. They read the rules and try to figure what to do. KV says itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Deepak who has stolen the cap. Dipika suggests that she will erase Deepakâ€<sup>TM</sup>s score board and KV asks her to hide the page having the rules of the task.
Bigg Boss announces that the task has begun. Sreesanth asks Deepak whereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s their horse cap and Deepak feigns ignorance. Sreesanth goes and starts walking on the treadmill keeping a cloth bag on his head. Dipika asks him to step down but he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t listen. He seems to be in full support of Dipika.
At 12:30 pm, Dipika goes and tries to erase Deepakâ€<sup>TM</sup>s score board. Deepak also comes and erases Dipikaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s scoreboard. Dipika takes a water bottle and tries to throw water on Deepakâ€<sup>TM</sup>s score board. Surbhi and Romil join Deepak to protect his board.
Deepak starts scrubbing Dipikaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s board, Dipika splashes water on his face. Deepak says her real face is now visible. At 1 pm, Sreesanth starts scrubbing on Deepakâ€<sup>TM</sup>s board and spat on his name. Somi and Surbhi start shouting at him, saying what he did was wrong. Surbhi says he should have had his mental balance checked before coming back inside the house. Romil on the other hand, starts imitating Sree and acts like Sree â€" how he bangs the exit door and climbs the roof to leave the house.
Surbhi on the other hand loses it on Sree and calls him names, shouting on him, commenting on his mental state. Surbhi says how can he be so nice to Dipika now when he was saying bad things about her when he came back. Both Surbhi and Somi say why he didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t say all those things to Dipika on her face. Surbhi calls Sreesanth names. Deepak starts crying on the fact that Sree spat on his name. Romil tries to console him. Surbhi tells Dipika that Sree has made her the vamp in front of the entire house and now heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s showing solidarity with her.
At 1:30 pm Jasleen asks what was the point of supporting Dipika and going against Deepak. Sreesanth says that heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s forgiven Dipika for whatever happened in the past. Jasleen goes and tells others that Sree is now supporting Dipika. Surbhi and Romil lose their mind over this tactic. Surbhi accuses him of playing the sympathy card and asks him to come out and fight with her. She says that he does all of this for drama. Srishty tells Sree that he should speak to Deepak. Sree says had there been his own name on the board, he would have done the same. Deepak comes and asks what did he think before using the spit on his name. Sree says that it was written with a permanent marker and he wanted to erase it and he didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have a choice.
Jasleen once again comes to Sree and asks him how can he do stand by Dipika and spit on Deepakâ€<sup>TM</sup>s name for her, when he had to leave the house because of her. She asks what kind of a strategy is that and that the rest of the housemates are right in being upset with him. Sreesanth walks inside the house. Deepak tells Bigg Boss that Sree sin't following the rules of the task and is entering the house again and again so both the sanchalaks have mutually decided to disqualify him from the task. Jasleen tells Somi and others that Sree has created all this drama because he wasn't much visible in the task yesterday.The episode comes to an end.
