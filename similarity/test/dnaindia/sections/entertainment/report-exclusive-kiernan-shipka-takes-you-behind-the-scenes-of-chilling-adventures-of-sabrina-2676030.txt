Based on the Archie Comics graphic novel, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina series is all set to stream on Netflix on October 26.
Starring Kiernan Shipka of Mad Men, the series imagines the origin and adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch as a dark coming-of-age story that traffics in horror, the occult and, of course, witchcraft. Tonally in the vein of Rosemaryâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Baby and The Exorcist, this adaptation finds Sabrina wrestling to reconcile her dual nature â€" half-witch, half-mortal â€" while standing against the evil forces that threaten her, her family and the daylight world humans inhabit.
The dark retelling is full of horror and magical spells that sometimes make you chuckle. Lexicon from this show shall be published as DVD extra if and when they decide to come out with a box set. This show is nothing like the shows we all became fans of in the '90s. Talking about the difference, Lucy Davis who plays Sabrina's aunt Hilda Spellman, said, "This show and the 90's show are vastly different. There is comedy in it. But it's dark. When you are watching it there will be at least one person for who you'll go 'oh that's my favourite.'"Â 
Talking about her character and the show Kiernan Shipka said that the massive sets and dark tone of the show will connect with audiences.Â 
Michelle Gomez who plays Mary, the mother of demons, agrees with Shipka when it comes to the show being edgier. "What's amazing about this show is that these powerful women are unapologetic in their fierceness," Gomez, a Doctor Who alumn, added.
Miranda Otto who plays Zelda Spellman said, "She (Sabrina) is torn between two worlds that she loves and what path is she going to create. Sabrina will have to make hard choices along the way and that is the hero's journey for her."
