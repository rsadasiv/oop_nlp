Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif have wrapped up the Abu Dhabi schedule of the Ali Abbas Zafar directorial 'Bharat'. Katrina took to her official Instagram account to announce the news along with a selfie with her co-stars Salman Khan and Sunil Grover. She wrote, "Schedule wrap #bharat @aliabbaszafar went for shopping". While Salman has conveniently cropped half of himself from the selfie,Katrina looks exquisite and beautiful in a pink kurti. Sunil, on the other hand, curiously poses for the camera.
To keep the excitement of their fans growing, the team has been actively sharing behind the scenes pictures and glimpses from the sets of the film. The team had wrapped up the Malta schedule two months back and shared some amazing pictures from the location, while the first schedule of the romantic thriller was wrapped up in Mumbai.
'Bharat' is Zafar's third collaboration with Salman after the 2016 film 'Sultan' and the 2017 'Tiger Zinda Hai'. The 'Dabangg' star will be seen sporting five different looks spanning over 60 years, including a crucial part which will showcase the actor in his late 20s, looking much leaner and younger.
