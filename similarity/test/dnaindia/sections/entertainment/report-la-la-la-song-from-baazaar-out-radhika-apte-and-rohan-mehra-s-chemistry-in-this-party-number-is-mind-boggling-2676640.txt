The makers of the film Baazaar, which stars Saif Ali Khan, Radhika Apte, Chitrangada Singh and Rohan Mehra, have dropped yet another song from the film. 
The fourth song from the film, titled La La La, has been crooned by Neha Kakkar and Bilal Saeed. 
The party number featuring Radhika Apte and Rohan Mehra, has been shot against the backdrop of a club, with the two of them enjoying each other's company and having a gala time. 
Not only the chemistry between the leads impresses you, the lyrics by Bilal Saeed too will make you feel happy. 
On a whole, La La La makes for a good party number, however it cannot be touted as the party song of 2018 as the music of the song isn't that upbeat.

Baazaar is based on the life of a stock market business man, the film is directed by Gauravv K Chawla and marks the debut of Vinod Mehra's son, Rohan Mehra. 
Earlier in an interview with DNA, Rohan had revealed that he hadn't bagged this film because of his dad. 
He had said, "I heard about the film, in fact, I read about the film and was very intrigued by the storyline. When I learnt that Nikkhil Sir was making this film, I thought of auditioning for it. Initially the film was supposed to have only established actors and they were not even planning on taking newcomers. Eventually, they were convinced and had to audition a few rounds. Following which, I had to wait for months before I got a confirmation call. It was not something which was offered because I was a star kid, but had to really work hard for it."
The film backed by Viacom18 Motion Pictures, in association with KYTA Productions and B4U Motion Pictures presents in association with Emmay Entertainment, is scheduled to release on October 26.
