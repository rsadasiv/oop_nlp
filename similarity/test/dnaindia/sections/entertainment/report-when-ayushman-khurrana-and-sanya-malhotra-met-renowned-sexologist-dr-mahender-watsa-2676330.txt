With the Ayushman Khurrana-starrer Badhaai Ho all set to release tomorrow, the actor, pretending to be his charater in the movie, visited renowned sexologist Dr Mahender Watsa as part of a family planning discussion organised by Family Planning Association of India.

Speaking to DNA, Dr Kalpana Apte, Secretary General of FPAI said, " As a subject, sex and sexuality is something we need to speak about. It's important so that we can avoid myths and misconceptions and stay safe and health.
Effective partnerships through advocacy creates a win win for all and helps us tackle the subject light heartedly and drive home the key message'.
Badhaai Ho is based on a man, played by Khurrana, who realises that his parents are expecting a child. How he deals with the situation, especially handling of society is the crux of the film.
