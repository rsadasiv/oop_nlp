Anirban Das Blah, the co-founder of Kwan Entertainment (one of the biggest celebrity management agencies in India), allegedly tried to commit suicide in Mumbai on Friday night. 
He was reportedly rescued at 12:30 am by the Vashi Traffic police after they found him on Vashi old bridge, where he allegedly attempted to take his life. It's being said that he was seen climbing the barricades of the bridge when the police grabbed him and pulled him down. He looked depressed and was in tears, according to the police.  
"We had information about an individual coming towards Vashi bridge to commit suicide. We couldn't take chance and we laid a trap there in dark," senior police inspector from Vashi traffic told The Hindu. 
"He was crying. He seemed very frustrated and depressed. We took him to the police chowky, offered him water and asked his problem to which he said that he was frustrated with the #Metoo allegations on him. He was depressed due to the defamation he and his family faced. He along with nine other partners had founded KWAN and after four girls alleged him of harrasment in #Metoo campaign, he was asked to resign," Mr Gaikwad said.
"The traffic police handed him to us but we haven't charged him as he has not done any (suicidal) act. He told us that he had come for a walk at the bridge. After his family reached, we handed him over to them," senior police inspector Anil Deshmukh from Vashi police station said.
Mr. Blah was recently asked to step down from his position after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. "We have asked Anirban Blah to forthwith step aside from his duties, activities and responsibilities at KWAN, its subsidiaries and affiliates with immediate effect," said a statement issued by the entertainment and marketing company earlier this week.
"The past few days have been very disturbing to everyone in the light of the #MeToo movement and it has pushed us all to take a step back and introspect whether each of us is doing enough to create a healthy and safe environment," the KWAN statement said.
"We fully support the #MeToo movement and deprecate and condemn those who have exploited women in any form or manner. As a responsible corporate, we have taken assistance to ensure that we have efficient and appropriate processes to redress any complaint of misconduct in accordance with the law."
The company manages prominent Bollywood celebrities like Ranbir Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Tiger Shroff, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor and Jacqueline Fernandez.
