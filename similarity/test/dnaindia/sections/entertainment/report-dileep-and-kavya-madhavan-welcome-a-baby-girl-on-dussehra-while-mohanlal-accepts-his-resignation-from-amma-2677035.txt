Malayalam actor Dileep's wife Kavya Madhavan gave birth to their first child, a baby girl, at 4:45 am in a Kochi hospital on the eve of Dussehra (October 19). The much-loved onscreen couple got married in real life in November, 2016. They reportedly dated for over a decade before they finally tied the knot. 
Dileep was earlier married to Manju Warrier. While Kavya parted ways with her first husband, Nishal Chandra, in 2011. Meenakshi, who is the daughter of Dileep and Manju, is currently living with her father. Dileep says his marriage to Kavya took place with the full approval of his daughter. 
Dileep has been in the eye of the storm recently for his alleged involvement in the abduction and sexual assault case of a popular south Indian actress in which he was a key accused. President of Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA), Mohanlal, accepted Dileep's resignation on Friday. "He readily gave it and his resignation was accepted," he said. 
The decision to reinstate Dileep in AMMA had received a lot of flak and four actresses including the sexual assault victim had quit the organization over the same. Kavya was also interrogated by the investigation team in connection with the case.
