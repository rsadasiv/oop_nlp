Things have taken a turn in the Bigg Boss 12 house after former Indian cricketer Sreesanth and bhajan singer Anup Jalota returned to the main house from the outhouse.
After spending a dew days in the secret room, away from everyone, but observing them every minute, Sreesanth is on an anti- Dipika Kakar mission.
In the past one month, the cricketer-turned-actor-turnedpolitician portrayed every possible emotion in the house- ranging from anger, happiness to sadness, and all this has made him a constant topic of discussion.
However, recently something that has caught the attention of the media is something shocking. 
In a revelation made by the former cricketer's ex-girlfriend, Nikesha Patel, Sreesanth was in a live-in relationship with her while he was dating his now wife Bhuvneshwari Kumari. 
Nikesha told Bangalore Times, "I've not met Sreesanth after the break-up, but I have been watching him on Bigg Boss. Sreesanth claimed on national television that he was in love with Bhuvneshwari for seven years before he got married to her. This makes me wonder, why was he in a live-in relationship with me for over a year around that time."
"In the past five years, I have quietly moved away from it all, after the break-up. But, I have not really been able to move on from the relationship, as I have many unanswered questions. What was he doing with me if he claims he was in love with his wife all the time that we were in a relationship? It makes me feel bad," she added.
In a recent episode of Bigg Boss 12, Sreesanth shared his love story with the other inmates, where he had said that he was in a relationship with Bhuvaneshwari for seven years before they decided to tie the knot.
Sreesanth and Bhuvaneshwari Kumari got married in 2013 and are parents to two beautiful kids.
