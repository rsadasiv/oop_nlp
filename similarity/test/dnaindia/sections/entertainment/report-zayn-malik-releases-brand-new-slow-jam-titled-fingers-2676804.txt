Zayn Malik came out of a short hiatus on Thursday to release a new single titled 'Fingers.'
This slow jam will be part of the second solo album of the former One Direction member, reports Billboard. Reportedly, the singer recorded this number over the summer in London.
The love ballad has a smooth R&B vibe which is in complete contrast to the previously released tracks -- 'Sour Diesel' and 'Too Much' -- that lean towards EDM and dance groove, respectively.
Zyan croons - 
I can't even text ya
Cuz my fingers ain't work, 
but my heart is
If you wanna let me know where you are, then
I could come (I could come alive)
I could come and love, yeah

The 'Pillowtalk' singer is yet to reveal the title or the release date of his second studio album. In the meantime, he is treating fans to covers of popular songs by famous crooners including Beyonce and Elvis Prestley.
