Tamil film, Vada Chennai, which stars actor Dhanush, is being appreciated and has been receiving good reviews from both the critics and audience alike.¬†
The gangster drama, set in north Chennai sees Dhanush essaying the role of a carrom player.¬†
The film is directed by Vetrimaran, also features Aishwarya Rajesh, Ameer and Andrea Jeremiah in pivotal roles.¬†
In the wake of the ongoing #MeToo movement that has taken the Hindi film industry by storm, and calling out their perpetrators, Vada Chennai actress Andrea Jaremiah also spoke on the same.¬†
When Andrea, who plays the character of Chandra in the film, was asked by Behindwoods to comment on the issue of casting couch in the industry and whether she has faced it or not, the actress said that it does happen in the industry but she hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t faced it.
The Vishwaroopam II actress further added that women should learn to say 'no' to powerful men from the industry wjo ask them for sexual favours in lieu of work.¬†
She also said that women who agree to compromise pave difficulties for women who say no to such influential men.
Andrea Jeremiah said, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never experienced casting couch myself. If I date a guy, it is only because I like him and vice versa. I am an actor, and I know other actors who have never had a casting couch experience. It also depends on the vibe you give off to people. If somebody meets me, they will know that his girl means business‚Äù.
She also went on to say that, ‚Äoecasting couch is not just a man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fault.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄoeIt is important to say this because we blame the other side always. If women are not willing to sleep for work, then they won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ask for it. A woman should have the confidence and say ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I believe myself and I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sleep with anyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. Then casting couch will not exist. If they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have that confidence and compromise, men are also humans. And this makes it difficult for women who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to compromise,‚Äù she added.
Andrea further said, ‚ÄoeTake me for an example. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come from a filmy background. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have any producer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s influence. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve made my mistakes. I worked my way up. I work with big directors. I work with good actors. I act in female-centric films. And I do all this, without ever indulging in a casting couch experience. Because I believe in hardwork, talent, and blessing. It is possible. It may take more time, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s possible.‚Äù
