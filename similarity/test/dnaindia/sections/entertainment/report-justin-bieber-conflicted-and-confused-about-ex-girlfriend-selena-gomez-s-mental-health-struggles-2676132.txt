Justin Bieber feels bad for his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez who continues to seek treatment for her mental health.
A source recently told E! Online that Bieber feels "conflicted and confused" about it. "They have both had emotional struggles and bonded over that in the past," the insider added.
Another source told E! Online last week that the singer also felt sad for Gomez.
The insider shared, "Justin and Selena are not in touch but him hearing the news about Selena definitely upsets him. Justin also feels guilty. He wants to help everyone. He truly wants Selena to be happy, and it's upsetting to know she's battling health issues."
The second source said Selena is "already feeling better" and "getting the help she needs" on the East Coast at the treatment facility.
The second insider also added that "Depression is something she's always struggled with, but whenever it gets really bad for Selena, she removes herself from social media and withdraws from people who aren't a handful of the people she trusts."
Bieber and Gomez dated on-and-off for about three years, but broke up in 2014. They reconciled later in November 2017 when they were spotted kissing at one of his hockey games. A few months later in March 2018, they decided to take a break from each other for a while.
However, not long after that, Bieber was spotted hanging out with his new lady love Hailey Baldwin.
Recently, Gomez entered a mental health facility for receiving treatment for an emotional breakdown.
She is currently at an East Coast psychiatric facility and is receiving Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). The therapy is useful in treating several mental disorders. The 'Back To You' singer has received DBT in the past too.
Selena sought treatment once in 2014 and again in 2016 for her mental well-being.
