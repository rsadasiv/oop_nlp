As the #MeToo movement is gaining momentum, women join hands, are supporting each other and calling out the perpetrators.¬†
Women filmmakers from Indian film industry too have joined hands to support people sharing their stories of sexual harassment and have decided not to work with any proven offender.
Critically-acclaimed directors such as Konkona Sen Sharma, Nandita Das, Kiran Rao, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar are among the eleven women filmmakers who have pledged their support to India's #MeToo movement.
However, a Twitter user replied to a tweet shared by Konkana Sen Sharma on the same, and accused them of 'hypocrisy' and claimed that filmmaker Reema Kagti, was ‚Äoeknown to sexually harass Mouni Roy during Gold movie‚Äù.
The tweet by the woman read, "Oh come on with this hypocrisy!! Reema Kagti has herself been known to sexually harass @Roymouni during Gold movie! The blinds r all over the net! N she is part of this??"

This did not go down well with Mouni Roy, who jumped to Reema‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s defence and slammed the Twitter user.¬†
The Naagin of the television industry made it clear that she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t harassed on the set of the Akshay Kumar starrer Gold by anyone‚Ä" director or otherwise. Mouni also pointed out that maligning statements like these would take away from the women, who have been wronged in real and whose #MeToo stories and ordeal deserve the most attention.
Mouni Roy's tweet read, ‚ÄoeI was not harassed on the set of Gold by anyone. Director or otherwise. I wish this maligning would stop as it not only harassing me and Reema Kagti but also taking away from women that have truly been wronged.@konkonas @rachitmehrotra.‚Äù¬†
On the work front, Mouni Roy is busy shooting for her next film, titled Made In China, which also stars Rajkummar Rao.
