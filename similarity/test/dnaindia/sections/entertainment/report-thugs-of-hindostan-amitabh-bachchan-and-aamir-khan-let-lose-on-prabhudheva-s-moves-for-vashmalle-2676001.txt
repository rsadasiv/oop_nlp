Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan have collaborated for the first time to make Yash Raj Films' Diwali offering Thugs of Hindostan. The filmmakers released a glimpse of the first song from the movie titled 'Vashmalle' on Tuesday. The two stalwarts of Bollywood are seen shaking their legs to the choreography designed by none other than Prabhudheva.Â Â 
With Vashmalle, which means 'Dance your heart out and make merry,' Prabhudheva gives a few unique dance moves that shall become part of reality show stages and upcoming wedding season.Â 
Vijay Krishna Acharya, director of Thugs of Hindostan says, â€oeIt is amazing that we could write a suitable moment in the film that sees these two icons of Indian cinema shake a leg with each other and the song will stand out because of their infectious energy and camaraderie. The song presents Mr. Bachchan and Aamir Khan in the mood to celebrate. I have to reveal, the sequence will show them getting drunk during the celebrations and then breaking out to dance on this high energy number. It is a priceless moment that we have captured in Thugs of Hindostan.â€
Sukhwinder Singh and Vishal Dadlani have sung this anticipated number while celebrated lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya has penned its supremely catchy lyrics. Ace music composers Ajay-Atul have created this track.

Thugs of Hindostan co-stars Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh. The movie is set to release on November 8, in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.Â  Â
