Salman Khan's ex girlfriend and former Bollywood actress Somy Ali, took to her Instagram and wrote a post supporting the ongoing #MeToo movement in the country.Â 
In a long message, Somy has praised actress Tanushree Dutta for kick starting the long due movement in India.Â 
The Pakistan-born actress also talked about how she was sexually harassed at the age of five and raped at the age of 14, and therefore, she understands what it takes for a woman to speak up.
Somy Ali wrote, â€oeAs a survivor of sexual abuse at the age of 5 and rape at 14, I would like to salute all those that have spoken up and plan on doing so. I know it is very difficult to do it because I have been there and it took me many years to be able to talk about it. It takes an immense amount of courage to share this with the world. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s even harder when you tell those that are close to you and they are supposed to protect you, yet they do nothing. I have been there too and it hurts like hell. But I want these survivors to know it is truly liberating and completely worth it."
Â 
The actress further wrote, "There is nothing we canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t overcome with strength and courage. Keep smiling and keep fighting. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s our time now!!! #metooâ€
Â 
Somy Ali also shared two videos on her social media where she can be seen praising Tanushree for being a role model for women empowerment today.Â 
She posted, â€oeA special thanks Tanushree Dutta for initiating the biggest movement in the history of South Asiaâ€.Â 
Â 
In yet another video, she says, â€oeNo means noâ€.
Â 
Tanushree Dutta had earlier accused veteran actor Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her 10 years back on the sets of 2008 film Horn OK Pleasss.Â 
After the actor filed a defamation suit asking Tanushree to apologise, the actress too opened the case and lodged a complaint freshly requesting for an immediate arrest for Nana and the other two involved in the matter.
