They are as warm and forthright as you'd expect Bollywood's quintessential girl and boy next-door to be. 'Namaste England' marks Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra's second collaboration after their 2011 debut film - 'Ishaqzaade' and their equation seems to have only grown better. 
While Arjun feels Parineeti brings out the best in him, she finds it difficult to romance Arjun. She says theirs is the most real, non-judgemental and genuine friendships. Their relationship has gone through a complete arc and Parineeti feels it's only recently that they have started valuing it. 
Watch the full interview as they talk about their latest film 'Namaste England', the unique bond that they share and more... 

'Namaste England', which released on October 18, is the second film in the Vipul Amrutlal Shah-directed series - the first was 'Namastey London', starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif, which released in 2007.
