Actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are all set to reprise their roles from the Conjuring films in the next Annabelle installment.
Wilson, 45, and Farmiga, 45, played Ed and Lorraine Warren, respectively, in Conjuring and Conjuring 2.
The two characters will be back in supporting capacity for the Annabelle threequel, which will be written and directed by Gary Dauberman, reported Deadline.
The film will once again centre on the demonically possessed doll Annabelle, who has been placed by the Warrens in a location they believe she can no longer wreak havoc: their Artifacts Room. Soon the doll soon sets its sights on their 10-year-old daughter Judy (Mckenna Grace).
James Wan will produce the project via his Atomic Monster banner alongside Peter Safran of The Safran Company.
