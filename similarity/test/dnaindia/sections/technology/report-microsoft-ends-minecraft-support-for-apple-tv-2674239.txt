Minecraft for Apple TV version will no longer be supported by Microsoft. The app has been removed from the App Store and there won't be any in-game message updates either. As Engadget reported, the game will continue to be playable and refunds will be issued for purchases made up to 90 days before the announcement came into effect from September 24th.
Minecraft is one of the most popular classic games, originating on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. In the recent days, owing to Apple's requirement for developers to support the Siri Remote, the growth of games on the Apple TV platform has been hampered. 
Microsoft has fixed the problem with its Windows 10 October Update that caused some files to mysteriously get deleted from the updated systems. Microsoft says that it has now identified and fixed the problem which was related to a feature called 'Known Folder Redirection (KFR)' and in an attempt to remove extra duplicate folders, caused files to go missing, Engadget reported.
While only a small number of users were impacted by the problem, Microsoft is not ready to issue the update yet. It is currently rolling out a test version first before moving to the larger user base. 
Microsoft is currently investing in ride-hailing company Grab to push for artificial intelligence and big data to on-demand services. The company has made strategic investment in Grab. As part of the agreement, Grab will adopt Microsoft Azure as its cloud platform, TechCrunch reported. Microsoft and Grab will also work together on several innovative deep technology projects including new authentication measures such as facial recognition with built-in AI, look at uses for natural language processing, machine learning and AI in Grab's platform. 
Microsoft has also put on hold the roll out of the latest update to its Windows 10 OS after some reported about missing files on their systems after the update. Microsoft announced on its support page that it has paused the distribution of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809) for all the users after isolates report of users missing some files after updating.
