Chinese scientists have developed a new nanogenerator that can harvest energy from human motions to continuously power wearable electronic devices, state-run media reported. Scientists at Zhengzhou University have developed a washable and wearable nanogenerator based on hydrophobic nanofiber. It has a woven structure and can be attached to clothes to convert the mechanical energy generated by human activities into electrical energy, according to state-run China Science Daily.
This washable nanogenerator with its woven structure has provided new opportunities for the development of self-powered wearable electronics, state-owned Xinhua news agency said, citing the report. The research was published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.
