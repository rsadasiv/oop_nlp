To avoid a clash with Apple's iPad Pro and Mac event on October 30, Chinese smartphone manufacturer OnePlus has rescheduled its event to unveil OnePlus 6T. The company will now launch its new premium phone in New York on October 29.Â 
In a statement on Friday, the company said if it chose to stick to the original timeline on October 30, its launch of the OnePlus 6T would be overshadowed by Apple.Â 
OnePlus had announced on October 8 that the OnePlus 6T would be unveiled on October 30 at simultaneous launch events in New York and New Delhi. However, this week on Thursday, Apple sent invites to its own event inÂ  New York on the same day where the company is expected to announce new iPad and Macs.
"When we announced the launch of the OnePlus 6T on October 8, we were convinced our timing would allow us to maximize the amount of people we could reach with our message. That changed when Apple announced they would be hosting their own event on October 30,"Â  OnePlus CEO Pete Lau said in a statement.Â 
"Flight tickets have been booked, hotel rooms reserved, and plans made. Internally, we were incredibly divided on this decision. We debated for hours before we came to one of the most painful decisions we have ever made," he wrote in a forum post on the OnePlus website.Â 
"We have only just begun our journey and cannot afford to let one of the most important products in our history be affected by another great product launch. So after deep reflection, we have decided to move the OnePlus 6T Launch Event in New York City to October 29," he added.Â 
The OnePlus 6T launch event will now kick off at 11 am on October 29.
However, the India launch event of the OnePlus 6T seems to be unaffected, NDTV reported. The OnePlus 6T India launch event is scheduled to kick off at 8:30 pm on October 30.Â Â The company has sent out media invites for the event, which will take place at the KDJW Stadium, located inside the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex in New Delhi.
Interested customers can also pre-book the device via Amazon India. Users will have to buy an Amazon e-Gift Card, which can be later redeemed against the OnePlus 6T when it is available to all. Pre-bookings for the OnePlus 6T begin atÂ  12PM Â on October 9.
OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has already revealed some details about the upcoming device. In an interview with CNET, Lau officially confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will include anÂ  all new Â  in-screen Â fingerprint sensor which will help users to unlock the device with ease. And, it will not include wireless charging support and IP rating. Lau mentions that OnePlus has taken a â€<sup>~</sup>toughâ€<sup>TM</sup> decision to remove headphone jack as well from the upcoming device.
Additionally, he also stated that the new device will be more expensive than the previous variant. However, did not disclose a price range.
