Xiaomi may introduce the successor to the Mi Mix 2S, the Mi Mix 3 on October 15.
According to a report by GizmoChina, a countdown timer for the launch of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 appears on the website, offering the time until the event starts. The countdown timer on the page will end ends on October 15 at 2PM.
The report also shed light on some key specifications of the upcoming device ‚Ä" 6.4-inch display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage variant and 3,850mAh battery. However, at the moment, Qualcomm has not released Snapdragon 855. This device could be the first smartphone to launch with the new chipset.
At the moment, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take this news with a pinch of salt. Few weeks ago, Xiaomi co-founder and President Lin Bin was teasing Mi fans with images revealing the imminent Mi Mix 3 bit by bit; the latest post reveals 5G support. These aren't just any old teasers that Lin Bin has been casually posting on the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo, these are key features -- a hidden camera that provides a notch-less and bezel-less screen, as well as the prospect of being one of the first 5G phones on the market.
Now it's been officially revealed that the Mi Mix 3 will feature 5G support. The same image posted by Lin Bin has also been tweeted by product management director Donovan Sung, showing the smartphone with ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>5G' written in the status bar. Furthermore, the background looks like a testing station. Sung noted that they've ‚Äoesuccessfully tested 5G data connections on Xiaomi phones, and ... can't wait for the official rollout of 5G next year!‚Äù
The ‚Äoenext year‚Äù part is presumably referring to the networks -- but who knows. As for what that 5G support could mean, Sung claims that users could see download speeds that are ten times faster than with the current 4G.
