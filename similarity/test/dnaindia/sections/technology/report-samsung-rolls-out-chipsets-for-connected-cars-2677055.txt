Samsung has marked its entry into auto space with the introduction of its new brands targeted at automotive solutions. The Samsung Exynos Auto and Samsung ISOCELL Auto offer cutting-edge application processor and image sensor technology solutions to the road. The Exynos Auto will help manufacturers develop in-car apps for infotainment, advanced driving assistance systems, and telematics.
ISOCELL Auto, on the other hand, is targeted at developing in-vehicle infotainment systems and telematics solutions. The sensors provide for better visibility of the road and surroundings even in low-light for precise identification of objects. 
Recently, Samsung opened its biggest mobile store in the world in India as it tries to take pole position in the world's second-biggest smartphone market amid fierce competition from Chinese brands. The South Korean tech giant's roughly 33,000 square foot (3,000 square metre) store in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru will help it extend its lead in India over global rival Apple, which has yet to open any flagship stores in the country.
India, which boasts more than a billion wireless connections, presents a lucrative opportunity for smartphone makers to expand beyond China and the United States where growth has slowed. Samsung opened the world's biggest smartphone plant outside Indian capital New Delhi just two months ago. "India is an extremely important market," Mohandeep Singh, senior vice-president, mobile business at Samsung India told Reuters, adding that the company plans to open more such stores in some of India's top 10 cities.
"These stores ... will really help us further consolidate our share as we move forward," Singh said. The new store will feature Samsung mobile devices but also showcase its consumer electronics products and latest innovations. It will also house a service centre for phones. Samsung has spent "huge" money to lease out the property, Singh said, declining to give specifics. Samsung, which runs 2,100 stores in India through franchise partners, is facing off against a host of Chinese brands led by Xiaomi Corp.
