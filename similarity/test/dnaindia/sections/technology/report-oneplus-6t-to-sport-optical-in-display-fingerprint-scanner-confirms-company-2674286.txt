OnePlus 6T will launch in India on October 30. The company has sent out media invites for the event, which will take place at the KDJW Stadium, located inside the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex in New Delhi.
Interested customers can also pre-book the device via Amazon India. Users will have to buy an Amazon e-Gift Card, which can be later redeemed against the OnePlus 6T when it is available to all. Pre-bookings for the OnePlus 6T begin at 12PM on October 9.
After OnePlus revealed that the new OnePlus 6T will sport an in-screen fingerprint sensor, the company has now stated on Weibo that the device will include an optical in-display fingerprint sensor and will not opt for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor.
OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has already revealed a number of details about the upcoming device. In an interview with CNET, Lau officially confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will include an all new in-screen fingerprint sensor which will help users to unlock the device with ease. And, it will not include wireless charging support and IP rating. Lau mentions that OnePlus has taken a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>tough‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> decision to remove headphone jack as well from the upcoming device.
He said, ‚ÄoeThe most difficult task in the day-to-day is‚Ä¶ finding a balance in what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ultimately going to be part of the end product and what has to be said ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>No‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> to.‚Äù Another reason to not include the headphone jack is the fact that the smartphone is 0.45mm thicker than the OnePlus 6.
Additionally, he also stated that the new device will be more expensive than the previous variant. However, did not disclose a price range.
Just a few weeks before the official launch of the OnePlus 6T, leaked press renders offer us a glimpse of what the smartphone might look like. Based on the images shared by winfuture.de, the device is offered in glossy and matte black finishes. Additionally, it also sports a tiny notch. Additionally, leaked images hint that the device sports a triple camera set up at the back. However, multiple leaks up until now mention that the OnePlus 6T includes a dual rear-camera set up.
