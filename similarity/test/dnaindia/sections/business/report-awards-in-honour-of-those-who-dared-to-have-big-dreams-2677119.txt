Much before the â€<sup>~</sup>start-upâ€<sup>TM</sup> lexicon entered boardroom discourses, a silent revolution was brewing in many parts of India. Going against the odds unleashed by licence and inspector Raj, a handful of visionaries were directing all their energies into their dreams, their own start-ups. They are now formidable entrepreneurs. Because they dared to dream.Â  Â 
Celebrating the success of home-grown innovative businesses, Indiaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s leading Hindi business channel, Zee Business, in collaboration with SAP India Pvt Ltd, is acknowledging the achievements of top entrepreneurs across seven cities in the country in Dare to Dream Awards.Â

The winners here will serve as role models for many who seek to make a name for themselves,â€ Dr Panda said, while highlighting governmentâ€<sup>TM</sup>s robust policies.
Applauding the winners, Zee Business Managing Editor Anil Singhvi said: â€oeThe real dreams arenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t those that you envision with your eyes closed but the ones you envision with your eyes open.â€
â€<sup>~</sup>Business Person of the Yearâ€<sup>TM</sup> Ramesh Agarwal, Chairman of Agarwal Packers Group, said: â€oeThis could be a platform for the entrepreneurs to get appreciated for what they have done. It would serve as a much-needed morale booster especially for the upcoming entrepreneurs and the younger generations.â€Â  In between awards, the doyens of entrepreneurship also shared their wisdom with the audience. In an experience sharing session moderated by Sajith Simon, Head - General Business, Indian Metros, Bangladesh & Sri Lanka at SAP India Pvt. Ltd., â€oeInspirational Leaderâ€ K S Rathee, Chairman of ASK Automotive Pvt. Ltd, said: â€oeWe had an idea, we had a vision and we were dedicated.
