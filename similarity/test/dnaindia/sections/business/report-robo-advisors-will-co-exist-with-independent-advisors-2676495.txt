Robo-advisory has transformed the way personal finance is managed through a modern portfolio concept. It is accompanied by multiple algorithms and, thus, gradually outpacing against a traditional practice of managing money.
Although the pace of growth in India is relatively low due to demographic challenges, a gradual penetration of technology usage and promotion of digital platform is expected to reach across diverse consumers. In the wake of this technology-enabled opportunity in personal finance, the robo-advisory has emerged as a niche differentiating proposition among prevailing traditional money managers.
Many businesses offering personal finance services have found a presence in online platforms, with robo-advisory as the core product during recent times. Initially, automation in the financial sector was aimed to improve compliance and provide a transparent regime, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. However, with the advancement of technology saw a structural automation in processes like basic customer compliance, to keep pace with growing business opportunity. Further, it expanded to other aspects of financial planning, such as identification of risk capacity of investors, asset allocation based on lifecycle and periodic evaluation of portfolios.
Although it is relatively difficult to find a full-fledged robo-advisory firm in India without human intervention, many service providers are currently offering a hybrid model which is a combination of machine and human decision.
Robo-advisory offers a flexibility and convenience as opposed to Independent Financial Advisors or any retail advisor in terms of corpus required for investment. It generally charges a lower fee for its services. It also assists investors in making a decision with accurate data through its algorithm set-up, which makes it more efficient than human intelligence. One important aspect of robo-advisory is its efficiency to monitor big number or size of financial instruments, and thus offer a wide reach across different asset class.
However, IFAs also play important role in wealth management as financial planning is a complex process. It involves tax optimisation and insurance planning, apart from just investing and monitoring. Consumers' goals or objectives vary in a number of ways. This requires an element of human support in order to align with the changing requirement. This aspect of financial guidance is not fully integrated with robo-advisory, although it has the capability to guide through this decision.
The dynamic nature of the financial market which changes on a periodic basis and a need to make quick decisions to serve interests of consumers, has enabled both systems to progress and assist each other in wealth management. The IFAs are no longer skeptical on the proposition offered by robo-advisory firms, nor can robo-advisory firms forgo the significance of IFAs to guide investors through different phases of the investment cycle. This ensures that technology and human expertise remain on par.
Robo-advisory has advanced with help of technology to address changing preferences of today's consumers and managed to build itself as a substitute for traditional platforms. But a likelihood of robo-advisory completely taking over the role of IFAs is a far-fetched process. Both these elements seek to co-exist in the same ecosphere. With rapid evolution in digital platforms and consumer preferences, robo-advisor has gained momentum is here to stay.
