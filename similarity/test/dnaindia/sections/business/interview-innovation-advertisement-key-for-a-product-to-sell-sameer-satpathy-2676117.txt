Consumers will buy the product if we add some value to it and pack it in a way that pleases them. Besides, innovation and advertisement are two things that make a consumer buy a product.
Competition is a good thing not only for us but also for the economy. It increases efficiency and makes us think before investing.
We have a simple philosophy and that is we do not invest; it is the brand that invests. As in, the brand can earn for itself if it has the potential to grow. In addition, we don't go for selection as every team is engaged in playing its own game and thinks on the ways to grow them. So it is about innovation and ambition.
