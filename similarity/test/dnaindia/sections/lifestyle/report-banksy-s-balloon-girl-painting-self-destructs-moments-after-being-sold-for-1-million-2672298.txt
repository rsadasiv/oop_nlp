A painting by mysterious British artist Banksy shred itself into pieces at the moment it sold for more than £1 million at a London auction on Friday.
"Girl with Balloon", one of Banksy's best-known works, disappeared into a shredder hidden in its frame as the hammer fell at £1,042,000 ($1.37 million), a sum that matched the artist's previous record sale, auction house Sotheby's said.
"It appears we just got Banksy-ed," Alex Branczik, senior director and head of contemporary art, said in a statement on Sotheby's website.
Banksy himself posted an Instagram picture of shocked onlookers watching the painting disintegrate, with the caption: "Going, going, gone..."
Going, going, gone...

Sotheby's said this was "certainly" the first time a work of art started to shred itself after coming under the hammer.
Immediately after the gavel drops and this Banksy is sold for ~$1 million, a remotely activated shredder concealed inside the frame reduces the artwork into to ribbons. Brilliant. pic.twitter.com/7eJG1cO0Bt
The auction house was not immediately available for comment on the whereabouts of the painting's remains, or how its value might have changed in light of its self-destruction.
Banksy, whose real identity is unknown, is known for sharply ironic outdoor graffiti with political themes, including at Israel's barrier at the West Bank and Disneyland where he painted a life-size figure of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.
Once a small-time graffiti artist from the English city of Bristol, Banksy's work has become hugely valuable.
