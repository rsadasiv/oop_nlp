I think my cousin is gay. Actually Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m pretty sure he is. He hides it from me and the entire family. But Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m so close to him. I wonder why he hides it from me. Can you please suggest what I can do to let him know Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m absolutely supportive of him? How can I help him come out of the closet?
Namaskar! It is really heart-warming to see you so supportive of your cousin. You seem like a very sweet cousin. I wish you were my cousin too. Not to say I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have sweet cousins, but this is next level sweet!
Having said that, what makes you so sure heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gay? Maybe you could take him into confidence and let him know that he can share whatever he wants with you and eventually ask him whether heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gay. If he confides in you, well and good.
If you think that itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s bothering him and his personal as well as professional life, you could speak to a counsellor and probably fix an appointment with your cousin as well.Â 
Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s better to consult a professional first rather than cause permanent damage to a beautiful relationship. Once heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s out of the closet (if heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gay, that is), Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m sure you will be by his side and support him with whatever he chooses to do.
