Thanks to slouchy tailoring, a laidback layering, an interplay of soft prints and a vibrant colour clash ‚Ä" menswear gloried at Spring Summer 2019 ready-to-wear shows at the recently-concluded New York Fashion Week. From Libertine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s maximalist take on shine-meets-prints idea to Monse‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s un-gender approach to boyish dressing to Sies Marjan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brilliant use of candy hues ‚Ä" menswear made its presence felt in runways dominated by womenswear.
Prabal Gurung‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s foray into menswear saw a delightful colour blocking and Tibi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sorbet hues on separates created drool-worthy ensembles. Stylist Isha Bhansali roots for Tibi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take on polished colour blocking and can easily picture it on actor Rajkummar Rao. She says, ‚ÄoeI liked Tibi and Monse. The clash of prints at Sies Marjan was also nice. The Prabal Gurung outfit seems tailor-made for Ranveer Singh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boisterous personality and he can totally carry it off. All in all pastels look great on men and our actors look suave in these colours. Overall, I see an un-gender vibe which was also seen at the recently concluded fashion week in Mumbai on the runway of Chola. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remarkable is that these trenches and pullovers look great on any body type. Moreover, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s relaxed and not oversized and can work on guys in the 28 to 32 waist bracket. Also, these looks aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t distinctively alpha female or male. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s great to see lines getting blurred in clothing. Having said that, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not a flying-off-the-shelf kind of trend and men will take time to embrace it completely.‚Äù
