Flowers are blossoming all over the runways. At Rodarte‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Spring/Summer 2019¬† showcase at the New York Fashion Week, models sashayed the catwalk flaunting rosebuds of various hues growing off their mane. Elsewhere, at Mansur Gavriel, more delicate floral accents made an appearance. At the recently-concluded Lakme Fashion Week, one saw floral accessories take centre stage for designers like SVA, Buna and Gaurang. Flowers in the hair have been a traditional Indian bridal look with many opting for the classic mogras or red roses, but now, more brides are choosing something contemporary. Even Kareena Kapoor Khan in Veere Di Wedding played the modern bride accenting her updo with small white flowers on either side. Katrina Kaif‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Bharat look, too, sees her with a floral spray complementing her bridal white.
Flowers are definitely the most go-to accessory at the moment. They lend a fresh, summery look to any festive ensemble, says Vanessa Fernandes, Salon Director, BBLUNT salons. ‚ÄoeIn fact, we often get requests for floral updos not only from a bridal entourage, but also from those looking to style a simple, summer dress. I think women are more open to the idea of experimenting with their looks, breaking away from traditional styling and opting for a modern edge on their big day. One can pick from a variety of floral options like orchids, full bloom roses, even daisies but the smaller, more delicate flowers like Gypsophila, known as baby‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breath, are quite the rage globally. With models at the recent Mumbai-based fashion week sporting delicate flowers in their messy tousled hairdos, this trend has definitely picked up,‚Äù she mentions. Of course, Kareena‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appearance in her last release Veere Di Wedding was another trigger. ‚ÄoeTrendy yet traditional, not only did she look stunning wearing a delicate spray of baby‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breath in her hair, but also chose to carry an entire dupatta made of it,‚Äù Vanessa adds.
When it comes to choosing flowers, opt for delicate ones that don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look over the top. The baby‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breath is a favourite at the moment, as is the ice cream creeper. Even the tiny Chinese roses look very pretty. Floral accessories are much in demand with brides, explains Clint Fernandes, hair and make-up expert. ‚ÄoeSome of them even use handmade ones with diamantes and Swarovski crystals, which adds to the jewelled factor and looks more decorative. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going for messy textured hair, just decorate the crown area or around the bun, that looks beautiful. Flowers work really well with an updo. If the hair is left open put some on the side, or even use it to accentuate a Grecian style braid. Just ensure that it complements the outfit. Most Indian garments are already heavily embellished and with the make-up and jewellery there shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be an overkill,‚Äù he advises. If one is going for flowers for the reception or Mehendi function, avoid it on the other days to retain the novelty factor.
Bipasha Basu's recent showstopper avatar for label Ruceru saw her flaunt a striking red and white lehenga with a sprig of dainty white flowers on each ear. Nushrat Bharucha, meanwhile, showed how to incorporate flowers with a voluminous blow-dried mane and Dia Mirza wore hers with a braided updo. Agnes Chen, Hair expert and Technical Head, Streax Professional says flowers can never go out of style. It works for all occasions and is an easy and quick way to up your style game. ‚ÄoeFlowers go well with a braid, a bun, curls or even when you let your tresses down. You can accessorise your hair with them on days when your hair is at its best or even on a bad hair day. Use them as floral head wreaths, bridal crowns, headbands or just a big flower pinned to the side of the hair,‚Äù she adds.
