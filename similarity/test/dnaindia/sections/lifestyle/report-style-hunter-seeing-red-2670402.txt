Statement coats have been ruling the Spring Summer 2019 line-up with aplomb! Realised in the jewel-toned duchess satin in bold, bright red hues â€" these staples have been the mainstay on the Milanese runways.Â 
From Versaceâ€<sup>TM</sup>s come-hither tailored take on it to Pradaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s preppy cocoon shape to Salvatore Ferragamoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s masculine cut version. While Versace teamed it with a colour-blocked turtle neck jumper and tights, Mrs Prada accessorised hers with a studded beret. Ferragamo, on the other hand, layered theirs on a neutral shirt.
