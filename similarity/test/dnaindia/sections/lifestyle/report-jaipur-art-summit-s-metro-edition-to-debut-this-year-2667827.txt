The much-talked about Jaipur Art Summit, which has been embroiled in many controversies through its past editions, takes a new leap this year. Before returning to Jaipur in December, the summit will launch its metro edition from New Delhi, moving to Mumbai and South Korea.¬†
The metro edition of the fest, which is into its sixth year, bears the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Cross Border Art Connect‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> theme and will feature international and national art pieces collected over the years by the parent organisation, including artwork from USA, Korea, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and more.¬†
The New Delhi leg of the show will run from October 4 to October 10. ‚ÄoeMetro Edition 2018 aims to present select artwork by foreign and Indian artists. It is designed to create a platform for artists, art lovers, and enthusiasts to splurge themselves in the true spirit of art beyond boundaries,‚Äù says Shailendra Bhatt, organiser of the summit. ‚ÄoeThe week-long programme is a three-dimensional one that will showcase artwork, feature an art competition for colleges, in addition to talk shows,‚Äù adds Bhatt. Jaipur Art Summit exhibition will be held at Triveni Kala Sangam, while the art competition will be held at Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Nodia.
The Mumbai edition will be organised from October 19 to 21 at Grand Hyatt, where only the artworks will be displayed. The art summit will head to Korea from November 22 to 25 and will return to Jaipur between December 15 and 20, where it features tribal and traditional art on the theme ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Biennale Art‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.¬†
The summit has been in the news nationally for various controversies it attracted over the years. ‚ÄoeArt knows no boundary or limitation, yet our art pieces have been curated with utmost caution. We will take care not to display the kind of work that has created controversies earlier,‚Äù Bhatt adds.
Participating artists from India include Alok Bhattacharya, Amrut Patel, Anjani Reddy, Dharmendra Rathore, R B Gautam, Ravinder Salve, Sudip Hazra and Vinod Sharma, among others; Korean artists include Keunyoung Song, Minjoo Lee; Sri Lankan artists include Chaminda Gamage, Sarath Perrara and Suneth Priya Aravandan. Other global artists participating in the show this year are Leroy Parker (USA), Ranjit Das (Bangladesh) and Renata Von Hoessale (Belgium).
Year 2014: Lord Ganesh Painting: A drawing of Lord Ganesha on a toilet pot angered a section of the society. Several social and religious organisations vandalised the venue in protest, alleging that the drawing hurt religious sentiments of the masses.¬†
Year 2015: The Hanging Cow: Artist Chintan Upadhyay created an installation ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Bovine Divine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> depicting a cow made of Styrofoam suspended by a balloon to send a message of saving the cow from plastic waste. The installation not only faced objection from the community, but also led to the detainment of Upadhyay and a co-creator. The police had said that a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>life-size cow hanging in air is offensive to their sensibilities‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.
Year 2016: Painting vandalised, artist beaten up: London-based artist, Radha Binod Sharma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s painting was vandalised and the artist was even thrashed for making a semi-nude and erotic painting of a woman.¬†
