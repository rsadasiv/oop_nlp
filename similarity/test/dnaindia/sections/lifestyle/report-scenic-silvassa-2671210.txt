A mention of Silvassa always conjured up the image of an industrial hub meant for business trips in this writerâ€<sup>TM</sup>s mind. So, it was far from an option for a quick getaway till a chance visit to the destination thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s on the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The place may not figure on many peopleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s list for a weekend escape, but the Union Territory Dadra & Nagar Haveliâ€<sup>TM</sup>s capital city may be a good idea to visit, thanks to its lush green gardens, lion safari, lakes to Kathiawadi fare and more. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s just a three-hour odd journey by road as well as by train and the ride or drive is scenic. Here are things to do there...Â  Â 

The best thing about the park is that outsidersâ€<sup>TM</sup> vehicles are prohibited from entering the reserve. You can book a government-operated open jeep for a 30-minute tour. Head there early because only a limited number of visitors are allowed, to prevent noise pollution. Apart from Chinkara, Blackbucks and spotted deer, you can also see Nilgai and birds like peacocks, thrushes, woodpecker, etc. in their natural habitat. The vehicle takes regular stops, so you can take your time to enjoy the visit.Â Â 

Just about three km away from the Deer Park is the lion safari. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s spread across 20 acres and itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a short 15-minute ride. There are only two lions here but the delightful part is that you can see them closely from the safari bus. You may also find some peacocks here. Apparently, two more lions may be brought here this winter.Â 

The park is like a small trail. You can enjoy a short walk here as you marvel at butterflies as well as flowers of different colours and sizes. Gorgeous and green arches to walk under and gazebos to relax will make your visit worth it. Thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s also an observatory that you can climb to get a sweeping view of the garden and outside. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a popular spot for family picnics.Â Â 

You can spend hours taking in the beauty of the sprawling garden. The green acres are manicured to perfection. But what stands out is that the plants here are associated with the nine planets of the solar system and arranged in the form of an astrological chart. The 27 plants and spokes associated with the nakshatra give the garden its name. There are ponds with lotuses inside, cut-outs of animals and information on different kinds of trees and plantation. Equally striking is an area outside the garden. You can sit under the tree on one of the benches and be enamoured by the Daman Ganga river flowing in all its glory.Â 

Even though an industrial region, Dadra & Nagar Haveli is inhabited by tribes such as Warli, Kokna and Dhodia. Albeit small, the museum in the heart of the city exhibits artifacts such as fishing and hunting tools (bows, spears and daggers), jewellery, musical instruments, agricultural and household items and so on. There are also life-size models, wedding outfits and images that give an insight into native tribes and their culture.
Silvassa is known as the garden city because of the various green yards it has. Five km away from the city is Vanganga Lake Garden, which boasts of blooming flowerbeds, Japanese-style wooden bridges, thatched huts and jogging tracks. And itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s by the lake, making it a gorgeous place to hang out at. Nearby is the Island Garden. Dudhni Lake, which is 20 km from the city and offers water activities like canoeing, jet skiing, speedboating, etc. Hirwa Van Garden has cascading waterfalls and beautiful flora. Swaminarayan Temple alongside Daman Ganga is also worth visiting for its expansive area, beautiful idols of gods, flowers and lawns.Â
