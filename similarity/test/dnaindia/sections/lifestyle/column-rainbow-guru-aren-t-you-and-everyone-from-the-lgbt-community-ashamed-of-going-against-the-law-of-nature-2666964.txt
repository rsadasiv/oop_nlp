Namaskar! If youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re ready to leave the cave you have been living in, welcome to 2018! In a country, which is proudly the largest democracy in the world and accepts all sorts of diversity, we still have shining examples of intolerance like yourself. Please give me one legitimate example of how anyone from the LGBT+ community has affected your life negatively.
In fact, I would like to ask you some questions:
A community, that encompasses millions of people who were denied their basic rights for a very long time and has had to face multiple atrocities â€" has been given a ray of hope by the honourable Supreme Court and you call it the darkest day? Who gives you the right to be the moral police?
The LGBT+ community is not asking for special favours or VIP treatment. If you think people asking for basic rights is such a big issue, why donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you dig deeper and have a conversation with yourself?Â 
About being proud of being gay, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m as proud of being gay as you are proud of being straight.
Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s really not a choice!
Lastly, about going against the law of nature, I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think nature has appointed you as itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s spokesperson. So letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s NOT go there, my darling!
In conclusion, I hope you get over your homophobia soon. Toodles!
