If the very idea of stretchy bottoms puts your sartorial nose out of its joint, have a look at the recently-concluded Paris Fashion Week, which revived the cycling shorts like never before. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel created a faux-yet-stunning beach in the Grand Palais lashed by the artfully-engineered undulating water waves as his girls frolicked on the sand in sporty shorts teamed with the label‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s signature tweed blazers.¬†
Prada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s version came in jewel-toned satin and Mugler‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presented them in a colour-blocked style. They were also seen on the runways of labels like Zadig et Voltaire and Each x Other. Malini Banerji, Fashion Director, Elle India sees their resurgence as an extension of the athleisure trend, which has been around for the past so many seasons now.¬†
‚ÄoeThe athleisure look was all about comfort, being cool and lending oneself a sense of identity along with ease. I see cycling shorts stemming from that idea. However, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re tricky to pull off for sure and only complement a certain body type and don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look flattering on everyone. Also, they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t allow much styling experimentation,‚Äù says Malini.
