This is a peculiar way of online flirting when all someone does is tag you in relevant memes on social media or just send you memes.
This is hitting two birds with one stone. You land in a new country for a vacation or work trip, and use a dating app to find a local to take you sightseeing and date him/her too.
If youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re on a dating app, you must have come across the term in peopleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s profiles. It means that the person smokes marijuana or is open to smoking it and prefers dating someone who has a similar taste.
The opposite of Metrosexuals, they are the kind of men who make you go weak in the knees. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re bearded, sport the rugged look and are sexy as hell, but alas they arenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t too keen on personal grooming.

You matched with someone on a dating app, and then you stalk his/her social media presence, professional history, friendship circles, etc. prior to meeting them, to get an advantage over them. In short, you feel free to climb up their ladder of privacy.
This is a portmanteau of three words â€"Â  sports, porn and metrosexual. These are guys/men who go to the gym in order to share erotic images of their toned bodies on social media.

Most penguins species are known to be monogamous, theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re adorable and obviously look identical. Similarly, when you and your romantic interest are baes forever, and even dress identically, youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re Penguining.
Usually, a relationship can steer in two directions, one, wherein youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re wanting to spend quality time together and the other, wherein youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve reached a point of suffocation.
