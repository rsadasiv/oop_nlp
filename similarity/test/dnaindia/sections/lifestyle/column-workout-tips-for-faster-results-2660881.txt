You can get little results by changing a little of what you do for the better. But, if you really want to build kick-ass physique, you need a sound overall approach. Here are a few crucial tips that you can put into action today!
It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a tale as old as time. You can lift a weight for a solid set of eight-10 reps, so you add another small plate. And another. You get stronger, and you start seeing muscle where there wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t any before. It should keep progressing like this forever, right? Alas, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. Eventually, the strength and size gains that seemed so easy at first grind to a halt and maybe even slip backward.
When the weights can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get any heavier, the true art of exercise programming begins. If your gains have stagnated, try changing up your training routine at specific times to maximise results. After every 15 days, you need to review your performance and even change your training pattern, if required. If you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re repeating the same workout for a longer period of time, you may not get all the benefits or results that you always wanted.
To continue challenging your body and improve your strength and conditioning of your muscles, you need to switch your sets and reps, exercise selection, rest periods, and exercise order after every 15 days. Our body can adapt to any type of exercises. So, once it gets used to a certain type of workout, the body becomes less challenging and, as a result, less effective. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s very important to revise your exercise plan, every 15 days.
Mix strength and cardio. Bench press with bench step-ups is great, but bench press with battling ropes is only going to fry your upper body for your presses.
There is nothing to be gained by trying to keep up with someone who is on a completely different level than you. A better way is to be honest about your ability level, especially in the early going.
Progressive overload is the key. Muscles grow only if you progressively overload heavier weights than what your muscles had previously adapted to. Also, make sure you are not compromising your posture and technique while lifting heavy weights.
Often, people get too taken with the notion of ‚Äoeno pain, no gain.‚Äù While on its face, this saying is entirely accurate, often it leads to poor training decisions. When performance improves, fitness improves. Focus on your performance, and the rest will take care of itself.
The mentality of a pro athlete isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t normal. Something has to be triggered inside you ‚Ä" a desire to always push yourself beyond the limits.
