Stress is a curse of the times we live in, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s engulfing people across ages throughout the globe. According to a survey conducted by Cigna TTK Health Insurance Company, 95 per cent of Indian millennials, between age group 18-34, are stressed, as compared to the global average of 86 per cent. Also, it found that work is the main trigger for stress amongst Indians. The survey also highlighted the reluctance amongst individuals towards getting medical help. Medical cost acts as another barrier in seeking professional help, with 75 per cent of subjects saying they are not willing to talk to a medical professional. We asked experts to throw light on the matter...
Chronic stress is becoming an epidemic. Today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s millennial is stressed about everything that includes the future, relationships and career. ‚ÄoeMost come to me in confused state of mind as they seek instant gratification. Relationships have become complicated with quick break-ups and rebound effects. The youth want to make quick money and is anxious about work most of the time,‚Äù says clinical psychologist and trauma therapist, Seema Hingorrany who sees at least five to six young clients in a day with various work-related stress, ranging from bankers to media professionals, ad agencies to doctors. They come on weekly or forthrightly basis for myriad conflicts due to work problems.
Youngsters in India are more stressed because as it is day to day life is stressful and to add to it, work stress. One reason is finding a job. Secondly, stress comes from sustaining at the work place and excelling in it. This age group also suffers from ‚Äoefinancial insecurity‚Äù. Most of this age group is seeking jobs that are well-paying so they can build a ‚Äoegood life‚Äù, which includes having a house, a car and a good lifestyle. ‚ÄoeOur youngsters are striving to have all of that before the age of 35. They are pushing their limits, which is the main reason for work stress to affect them so negatively,‚Äù says clinical psychologist, psychotherapist and tobacco treatment specialist, Mansi Hasan.
Hasan on an average sees about seven to 10 clients per week, who come in with these issues. ‚ÄoeThese vary from excessive working hours, being under paid, over load of work pressure, deadlines, work politics, difficult bosses, no increments and at times being fired due to downsizing. Physical exhaustion is another concern for some as everyday travel itself is a task,‚Äù she informs, adding that a large portion of these referrals come from the corporate section. However, there are other professional consultants such as pilots, chartered accounts and lawyers. The main reason to seek counselling is often mental and physical exhaustion, which lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, irritability, anger and interpersonal conflicts.¬†¬†
Given that stress has become part and parcel of work life today, at what point does one need to seek professional help? Hasan says that if one is experiencing anxiety, sleeplessness, low appetite, irritability, increased absenteeism ‚Ä" these are clear cut signs that there is a concern, which needs to be addressed. However, the litmus test to work stress can as simple as waking up and dreading to approach work, that in itself is a big alarm to seek help.¬†
When stress exacerbates and leads to severe anxiety and depression, when people start developing physiological complaints like chronic back pain, migraines and stomach issues, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to get oneself evaluated, advises Hingorrany.
