Spring Summer 19 canvas seems to be lit with glittery crystals, beads and sequins. From Badgley Mischka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s high-octane va va voom pieces to Nicole Miller‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s camouflage sequins to Tory Burch‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s placement of coins on a summer dress to Proenza Schouler‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s futuristic silver ‚Ä" the overall story seems to be a party-ready closet with unmitigated metallic mayhem.¬†
Unlike the old school, we as a society celebrate things more often and in our festive season is not only confined to fall-winter anymore. ‚ÄoeThat somewhere along with global domination of mega brands into new cultures has made shine a relevant category across seasons. For Spring Summer, pattern sequins such as camouflage seen at Nicole Miller, ombre ones seen at Prabal Gurung are a nice breather as it plays with both print and shine. Futuristic silver in casual dressing is one of the key trends along with red foil for evening pieces seen at Rodarte,‚Äù says Aniket Satam, visiting faculty Istituto Marangoni.
Malini Banerji, Fashion Director, Elle India sees shine as a way of celebrations. ‚ÄoeSparkle has all to do with celebrations in a big way and since in the winters people dress up in a big way, that has sort of spilt into the summer in a lighter way,‚Äù says Malini.
