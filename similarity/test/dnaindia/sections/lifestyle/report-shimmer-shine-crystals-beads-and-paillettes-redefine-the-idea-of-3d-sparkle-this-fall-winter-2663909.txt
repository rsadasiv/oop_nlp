Maximalism has been the key runway story over the last many seasons and this Fall-Winter, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all aboutÂ the mega-wattage shimmer induced by fringes, tassels and chainmails.Â 
Labels like Gucci and Balmain have been the key catalysts in introducing pieces with statement-making sparkle on separates. Be it the chainmail dresses seen at Paco Rabanne or the mesh overlay at Christopher Kane â€" itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hard to overlook the all-pervading 3D shine, which has also dazzled the high-street racks. We get experts to share their take on this phenomenon. Stylist Mohit Rai says, â€oeThe maximalist aesthetic will continue for another season, maybe with some military influence.â€
Shine has been the key component of our core aesthetic and itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hard to envision a festive closet minusÂ embroideries. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Fashion Director, Vogue India observes that in India, we often take our embellishments for granted while internationally, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s considered luxury. â€oeAn average personâ€<sup>TM</sup>s outfit here always has a bit of embroidery, but we donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t give it much importance. However, globally itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s seen as an expertise. Of course, its placement and amount may vary depending on the label, for example, they may use just one stone, but in different sizes.â€Â 
A section of stylists feel that these visually-arresting pieces donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t really translate into everyday style. Stylist Divyak Dâ€<sup>TM</sup>Souza says, â€oeThis kind of fashion has a place on the runway and at the Met Gala, but doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t fit into everyday life of people.â€
