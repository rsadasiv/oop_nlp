In a scenario when words like dad-core and athleisure are thrown around without much thought, it was refreshing to see Tom Ford reigniting his runway with his unapologetic take on evening glam. Body-skimming pencil skirt flirted with risquÃ© lingerie and their sheerness was offset by faux croc bombers.
Our very own Lakshmi Menon walked the ramp. Looks like the line was inspired by Tomâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all-time muse Carine Roitfeld, former editor of French Vogue whose personal uniform has always been a tight body-con skirt teamed with a soft camisole and a jacket. The menswear stood out thanks to tone on tone layering andÂ super glossy evening pieces.Â
