Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s difficult to get the best of both worlds under one roof. However, Powai-based QSR Elâ€<sup>TM</sup>Rancho and Pick Pocket is up for the challenge serving up some delicious fare. We tried a few dishes from the menu, and recommend you drop by the next time you are in the vicinity.
For starters, we tried the Soft Shell Tacos (Rs 159) served here in tortillas with an in-house sauce, beans and jalapenos. Packed with flavour, these make for an appetising starter. The Grilled Chicken Pesto Skewers with 5 Spice Rice (Rs 249) was equally good. Loved the delicately spiced rice, the chicken however, could do with a little less salt. Overall this is a good combination if you are looking for a quick meal. The Chicken Berry Pulao (Rs 249) was served with a raitha. It was strictly okay, the raitha does not really complement the pulao, which is a bit dry and needs a gravy and could do with some more tarty berries rather than the sprinkling that came with our order. The Turkish Baklava (Rs 159) is the perfect finish to an interesting meal. Weight watchers would love the fact that itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not soaked in syrup like traditional Baklava, but purists may be harder to please with this not so sweet treat.Â 
Our verdict: If you want to try both Lebanese and Mexican fare under one roof in a quaint and colourful eatery, Elâ€<sup>TM</sup>Rancho and Pick Pocket, ticks all those brackets. With a few tweaks here and there, this QSR could actually be a good meeting and lunching hangout.
