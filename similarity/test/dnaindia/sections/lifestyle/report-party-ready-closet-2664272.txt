It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a season of shimmery brocade, jewel-toned chanderis and recycled polymer fabrics hinting at a celebration-focused closet, which can be worked from day to night with a few tweaks here and there. Be it Arpita Mehta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tropical wedding bling-meets-print offerings or Abraham & Thakore‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gold and black brocade saris or Pankaj and Nidhi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s appliqu√©d separates. Nachiket Barve‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s millennial maharanis have a penchant for floor-length gold embroidered jacket and Payal Singhal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rose gold separates had tone-on-tone floral embroideries. We get experts to analyse this soiree-focused wardrobe...¬†
If Arpita Mehta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fun bridal separates brought to mind a summer wedding, Nachiket‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pairing of embroidered jackets with tulle pocketed lehengas married comfort with elegance. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Fashion Director, Vogue India says, ‚ÄoeThere‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a move towards a more dressed up runway. One saw a lot of starburst and sparkle on day wear. The party pieces had a tropical day feel, like seen at Arpita‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s collection. Nachiket‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blazers teamed with tulle skirts work for a fun bride. Shweta Kapur‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s green trench with black sparkle on it was a new take on embellishments.‚Äù
Azmina Rahimtoola, owner, Atosa seconds that. ‚ÄoeArpita‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s offering is the answer to young brides and their entourage of bridesmaids. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something which the young millennial girls would wear at a destination wedding. Abraham & Thakore wove brocade into suits and classic pieces ‚Ä" which are worth investing in,‚Äù says she.

Stylist Divyak D‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Souza sees the treatment of shine as rather dramatic. ‚ÄoeShiny effect was executed in different ways, for example, Kallol Dutta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shine was different mimicking a treated foil. I liked his tent-like kurtas and cargo pants,‚Äù says Divyak.
Some of the menswear pieces with shine had a wearable appeal to them, Amit Aggarwal being a case in point. Stylist Mohit Rai says, ‚ÄoeAmit‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take on shine was amazing. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s masculine and well-cut ‚Ä" something a man with a classic sensibility would wear.‚Äù
