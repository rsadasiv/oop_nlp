The world is becoming a smaller place and so, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s only right that we promote cultural heritage in these changing times. With International Translation Day (September 30) that just went by, we take a look at a few titles that started out in a regional language and reached many more with their English translations.Â 
All of Kali and Ponnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s efforts to conceive a child â€" from prayers to penance, potions to pilgrimages â€" have been in vain. Despite being in a loving relationship, they are relentlessly hounded by the taunts and insinuations of the people around them. Ultimately, all their hopes and apprehensions come to converge on the chariot festival in the temple of the half-female god Ardhanareeswara and the revelry surrounding it. Everything hinges on the one night when rules are relaxed and consensual union between any man and woman is sanctioned. This night could end the coupleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s suffering and humiliation. But it will also put their marriage to the ultimate test.Â Publisher: Penguin Random HouseÂ 
Spanning the three decades of the deadly Sri Lankan civil war, Ummath highlights the plight of women across communal and ethnic divides. Through the lives of three women, Thawakkul, Yoga and Theivanai â€" one a social activist, the other a Tamil Tiger forced into joining the movement as a child, and the third a disillusioned fighter for the Eelam â€" the novel lays bare the complex equations that ruled life in Sri Lankan society during and in the aftermath of the civil war. In Ummath, author Sharmila Seyyid â€" once forced to live in exile for her outspoken, liberal views â€" interrogates Islamist fundamentalism, Tamil nationalism and Sri Lankan majoritarian chauvinism with her characteristic honesty and sensitivity.Publisher: HarperCollins
An old man is watching the sun set over his village one quiet evening when a mysterious stranger turns up with the gift of a day-old goat kid. Thus begins the story of Poonachi, the little black goat whose fragility becomes cause for wonderment to the humans around her. Before they know it, Poonachi has become the centre of his and his wifeâ€<sup>TM</sup>s meagre world. Wrought by the imagination of a skilful storyteller, this delicate yet complex story of the animal world is about life and death and all that breathes in between. It is also a commentary on our times, on the unequal hierarchies of class and colour, and the increasing vulnerability of individuals who choose to speak up rather than submit to the vagaries of an ambitious if incompetent statePublisher: Westland
One of Indiaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s legendary poets, Bharathiyar has touched the hearts of millions across the world with his motivational poems that are infused with spiritual and humanitarian contemplations. The powerful imagery and vigour of his poems emphasise our age-old cultural values and reverberate in the hearts of the young and old alike. Unique in its elegance, simplicity, and rhythm, the book takes readers on a discovery of India in all its diversity. From the creation of a progressive society with greater freedom for women, to the unmatched virtues of valour and wisdom of our great land, this book reinforces why Bharathiyar is considered a universal icon.Publisher: Rupa
The ManimekhalaÃ¯ is one of the great classics of Indian culture. A second-century Tamil verse epic, it is a sequel to the Shilappadikaram, which was also masterfully translated into prose by the acclaimed musician and scholar of Hinduism, Alain DaniÃ©lou. Rich with details of the periodâ€<sup>TM</sup>s arts, customs, and religions, the ManimekhalaÃ¯ provides an extraordinary picture of an age that suddenly comes back to life. It is the story of a beautiful young dancer who decides to forego her looming career as a courtesan in order to dedicate her life (with the aid of gods, demigods, and a magic bowl called the Cow of Abundance) to charity and to attaining the â€<sup>~</sup>bright light of knowledgeâ€<sup>TM</sup>.Publisher: Aleph
