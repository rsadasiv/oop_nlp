Botox treatments have conventionally been associated with smooth, often expressionless faces. While the cosmetic procedure, that has been around for 15 years now, is much sought after for plumping up the skin, concealing fine lines and giving a youthful appearance, there are many who hesitate due to the possible side effects. Those looking for a more subtle, natural-looking alternative, can opt for Baby Botox. It is still regular Botox, just given in smaller doses, and applied in a slightly different way by targetting specific areas. This is also seen as a preventive measure to modify how the facial muscles move. Celebrities like Amanda Holden and Courteney Cox have been criticised in the past for their over-Botoxed faces, meanwhile many feel Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex may have dabbled in this treatment.¬†
Baby Botox can be done in patients who want to look their age but yet age more gracefully. In fact, in India patients love to maintain their regular look and just want to remove the excess lines from the face. Dr Shefali Trasi Nerurkar, MD Skin, Consultant Dermatologist, Dr Trasi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Clinic & La Piel says initially when Botox was done, the required doses would relax the muscle without allowing any movement in them. ‚ÄoeThis made the face look frozen and unnatural. So patients were uncomfortable with the tightness and expressionless face. Also, it would become a topic of gossip amongst the friends.¬† In Baby Botox, the same composition of botulinum toxin is used on the wrinkles. However, the dose used is lesser, thus it relaxes the muscle contractions and smoothens the lines. It allows the patient to express naturally without giving out unwanted lines and folds,‚Äù she says.
This type of Botox works well for certain areas such as the frown lines on the forehead and crow‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s feet around the eyes. It is more suitable for those who are apprehensive about getting Botox, younger people, actresses or those in the performing arts, opines Dr Shuba Dharmana, Dermatologist, Lejeune Medspa. ‚ÄoeThis technique is not new. There are some practitioners that use fewer units of Botox than the traditional units for certain areas. For several years now, we have stayed away from that dreaded ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>frozen look‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> by employing fewer units in the treatment. For younger people in their 20s and early 30s, this can be used as a preventive measure too.‚Äù Dr Geeta Fazalbhoy, Dermatologist and Founder Member Skin N You Clinic, adds, ‚ÄoeFor beginners, it is a good option as the patients need time to get used to their new look. One can use a higher dose later if the patient likes the present look.‚Äù¬†
Debraj Shome, Facial Plastic Surgeon, The¬† Esthetic Clinics finds a number of patients are now enquiring about Baby Botox as it is the latest trend globally. He says, ‚ÄoeWhile typically Botox may last three months, the smaller doses have been known to wear off in four weeks or so. One of the major problems of Botox use in India is that people here traditionally want treatments which last longer. In any case, these fillers on the face last only for a few months. Now, with the use of Baby Botox, results sometimes last only four weeks. Most people do not have the time or the energy to invest in repeated injections and hence it has not become a trend in India yet!‚Äù¬†
