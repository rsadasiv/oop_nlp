One of India‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most prolific calligraphers, Achyut Palav has collaborated with Paul Antonio, who is easily among the most-sought-after calligraphy artists in the world, for a unique exhibition. East Greets West ‚Ä" A Conversation through Calligraphy curated by Tapan Mody, founder of yes yes, why not?, is on till¬†
October 30 at Tao Art Gallery, Worli. What art lovers will get to see here is an amazing confluence of two distinct styles.
The two artists spent many hours together creating artworks and sharing ideas and thoughts with each other. ‚ÄoeFor me, as a calligrapher, I got to explore a lot more. When Paul came into the picture, I looked at it as two cultures coming together. He is very disciplined and a perfectionist. We need to learn from him. When he was conducting the workshop, he was teaching the same things that we do, but he did that in an in-depth manner. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a very enjoyable process and we get to learn from each other,‚Äù said Achyut.
Paul, whose illustrious list of clients includes Kate Moss, Versace, and the Crown Office of England, shared that though their styles are different, watching Achyut work felt similar. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like the same writing but in a different script. The breath, the concentration... that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also relatable. The first piece that we started with was an ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Om‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. The whole room was vibrating when we were working on it. We all knew that this was a good start. This conversation started with a prayer. When we met, we hugged each other and then we prayed... and then we ate (laughs). But yes, praying together was such a beautiful thing. On a serious note, all these things ‚Ä" praying, sharing food and calligraphy ‚Ä" are all sacred things. Calligraphy is sacred because it has allowed us to recall our religious texts.‚Äù
The two have created all their works together for the exhibition. Speaking about their collaboration, Achyut adds, ‚ÄoeWe explored the idea of having a conversation through strokes and language. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about how Paul and I are worked. Letters connect people. For us, it was a process what we would discover at the end of the conversation on paper. Everything had such a deep meaning. Even the sounds that you hear of the strokes were just unreal.‚Äù
Before the two met in Mumbai, they had a brief video chat. Paul avers, ‚ÄoeWe had a chat just to establish some parameters because it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to be fun and games. There could be problems like the supply of tools and materials. Here you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have access to the material that I do. So, I had to think what tools to bring and also what I could leave with Achyut so that he could play with them later. The first thing was to figure out what we were going to try and achieve. Due to the multitude of meaning that a word can have in Hindi, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s more scope, whereas, in English, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a bit limiting. In order to convey a sense of emotion, you need to express it through a copy, you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get away with one word. So, we spoke about that and how to work around the issue. Achyut said let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just get some ink on paper.‚Äù And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what they did.
