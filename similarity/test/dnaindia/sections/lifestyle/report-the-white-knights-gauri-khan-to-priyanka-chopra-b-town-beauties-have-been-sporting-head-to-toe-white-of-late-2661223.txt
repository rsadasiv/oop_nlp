In the last fortnight, B-Town actresses have shown how to wear the tricky white-on-white combo and make it work not just at the airport but also at soirees. Gauri Khan was seen rocking a shine-on white ensemble at a brand launch last week, while Anushka Sharma was seen teaming a tee with a pair of cropped, pleated and cuffed pants as well as matching white sneakers. On the other hand, Deepika Padukone accented her monochrome look with tanned footwear and matching accessory. Priyanka Chopra and Jacqueline Fernandez were seen in matching mono hues, breaking its monotony with beige footwear. New kid on the block, Sara Ali Khan has been sporting it in Indian ethnic style for a while now. Stylist Isha Bhansali attributes its resurgence to the comfort-driven approach to dressing. She says, ‚ÄoeIt stems from the white sneakers trend. Break it with an accessory. Victoria Beckham rocks this ensemble beautifully.‚Äù¬†
Thanks to the organic wave sweeping the Indian style landscape, looks like this combination is here to stay. DP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comfy kurta look being a case in point. Stylist Divyak D‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Souza sees it shaping up in the Indie space. ‚ÄoeDP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mulmul Masaba or Sara Ali Khan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take on it spells an organic and easy-to-wear vibe. Actresses by far are focusing on comfort and it works for the Indian body type. White is classic and is a clear winner,‚Äù says Divyak.¬†
However, designer Payal Khandwala has an interesting take on it. ‚ÄoeWhite on white is really more a mood than a trend in my opinion. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a classic wardrobe staple, albeit tricky in monsoon,‚Äù says she.¬†
The athleisure wave has definitely taken over this year and has evolved into a high fashion look for any occasion, especially travelling. Designer Amit Aggarwal says, ‚ÄoeIt is a classic trend that is chic and timeless. The trend does spruce up one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daily wardrobe, but I personally prefer a tee to be worn its classic way and kept true to the beauty of its quintessential style.‚Äù
The monochrome ensembles are a no-brainer when it comes to airport dressing. ‚ÄoeIt fits more into the organic bracket, in the sense it is a classic look that lends itself well to simple occasions and can be elevated with jewellery and accessories. Knitted tees are fun and playful. Therefore, no one is getting tired of the trend. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a great way of taking a classic tee or top, having fun with it and elevating it. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s simple to do and why not show off all the hard work if you have been working out,‚Äù says designer Saaksha of label Saaksha and Kinni.
