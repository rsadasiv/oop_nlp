Statement-making fringes and tassels were out in full swing at the recently concluded New York Fashion Week. From Norma Kamaliâ€<sup>TM</sup>s tiered fringed twin sets to tassels accenting Anna Suiâ€<sup>TM</sup>s printed dress to Tom Fordâ€<sup>TM</sup>s high-voltage evening take on it. Gloss-heavy outings by Cushnie and Prabal Gurung saw a flurry of tiered fringed party dress which will be the red carpet favourites in weeks to come. Raf Simonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Jaws-meet-The-Graduate-inspired line at CALVIN KLEIN 205W39NYC extrapolated fringes to wreak an artisanal assault. On the other hand, Oscar de la Renta presented floor-length tassels that had a luxe-nomadic spin.
