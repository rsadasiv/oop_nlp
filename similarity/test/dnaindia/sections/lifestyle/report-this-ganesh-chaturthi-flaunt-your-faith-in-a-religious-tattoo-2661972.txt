It is the season of festivals. With Ganesh Chaturthi barely a day away and¬† Janmashtami having just passed, which will later be followed by Diwali and Christmas, there is much reason to celebrate. A number of men and women are getting inked to express their love and devotion for their faith. In fact, many are looking for creative and offbeat body art designs.¬†
Religious tattoos are an all-time favourite. The craze for these type of designs start a month or so before the festivals so that the healing of the tattoos is completed in time and they can take part in the functions and flaunt their works, explains Vikas Malani, celebrity tattoo artist and co-founder of BodyCanvas Tattoos. ‚ÄoeThe traditional images of all Gods is very popular. However, there are some people who are looking to try something different that they might connect with more. Something that displays the traditional sentiments along with a contemporary look. For example, like Lord Shiva in the Natraj form instead of the usual calm Shiva images,‚Äù he says. One‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s location also plays an important factor when it comes to people getting religious tattoos. For example, Mumbaikars prefer getting Ganpati etched whereas in Delhi people would get Shiva and Buddha and Jesus Christ and the cross design is more in demand in Goa.¬†
Starting from Gokulashtami till New Year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, India witnesses a number of religious events, and to truly get into the festive mode many turn to tattoos. Sunny Bhanushali, founder and tattoo artist at Aliens Tattoo says given the diverse religions in the country, a range of clients come in with requests for inkings of Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Krishna, Waheguru and even Jesus Christ. ‚ÄoeBoth men and women seek these kinds of designs to showcase their devotion to their God. While coloured ink looks good, given the Indian skin tone and weather one does not recommend it, as one may not get the desired output,‚Äù he says.¬†¬†
Chirag Jhala, owner, Inks n Needles Tattoo Studio says he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s definitely noticed an increase in religious tattoos during this period. People want something different and unique with the om symbol, mantras from the Bhagavad Gita, shlokas, Ganeshas being in demand. ‚ÄoeGenerally men seek the larger idol designs whereas women want something delicate and dainty. These are most popularly done on the upper body such as the back, chest, arms, wrists etc. Most clients come in with references from the internet. We show them the various styles, narrow down on one and create something unique. Depending on the design, one can get a coloured one but some look good in grey too. Ultimately, it should be treated as a piece of art,‚Äù he adds.
