Larger-than-life danglers seem to be taking centre stage this season with a number of fashionistas flaunting them at events. At a recent red carpet soir√©e, Deepika Padukone opted for a sheer white shirt with billowy sleeves and high-waist leather pants completing her look with a messy top bun, a choker and diamond earrings dripping till her shoulder. At the same event, Sonakshi Sinha flaunted a metallic long-sleeved gown simply accessorised with striking shoulder-length ear jewels. Model Diva Dhawan also sported long danglers at this awards night. Given that the festive season is on in full swing, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no better time to bring on the bling. Kajol has favoured a contemporary pair with Meenakari work to team with her sari for her film promotions, while last month, Sonam K Ahuja opted for statement pendant earrings at Giorgio Armani‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s SS 19 Fashion Show.
Shaheen Abbas, jewellery designer attributes this style‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s popularity to the fact that they look sexy. ‚ÄoeShoulder dusters sit on the collarbone and make a statement without trying too hard. They are also a great conversation starter,‚Äù she says, adding that today people want something different and out there. She suggests teaming a statement earpiece with something on the hands. She says, ‚ÄoeGo for stackable rings or a cool cuff, pieces that are easy breezy. Ensure that you balance the look.‚Äù
At the recent Emmys, Scarlett Johansson shone in a white sequined off-shoulder gown that she accessorised with chandelier diamond earrings, bringing the focus on her bare shoulders. Eshaa Amiin, celebrity stylist, explains this season has been all about the shoulders, fashion-wise. ‚ÄoeFrom chic off-shoulder tops to long shoulder duster earrings, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re completely hooked onto to this easy-breezy look. They are perfect to amp up any simple outfit. You can wear it to a brunch or pair with a mini dress for an outing, to give it that quirky touch,‚Äù she avers. Any style no-nos? ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wear them with a busy neck and shoulder,‚Äù she adds.
Bold shoulder-grazing earrings were spotted on the Fall 2018 runways of Versace and Balenciaga. Nitya Arora, Jewellery designer and Creative Director of Valliyan opines that women want to experiment with fashion or like to be adventurous and hence want statement pieces
