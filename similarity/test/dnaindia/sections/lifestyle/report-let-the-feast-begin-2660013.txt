With the Islamic New Year eve approaching, the Dawoodi Bohra community will be celebrating The Thaal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s birthday, a symbol of hope for the new year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s prosperity. And who better to throw a feast for this occasion than The Bohri Kitchen. A 15-course meal prepared by Mom Chef Nafisa Kapadia includes some rare delicacies and treats from the Bohra community. ‚ÄoeWe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve curated a special menu for this weekend and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going all out. This is probably our most ambitious menu yet,‚Äù Munaf Kapadia, Chief Eating Officer, The Bohri Kitchen tells us.¬†
While their popular Smoked Mutton Kheema Patti Samosas and Shammi Kebabs will definitely be a part of it, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also going to be Rann in Red Masala ‚Ä" lamb marinated in rich masalas for 48 hours and cooked for three hours on high pressure. ‚ÄoeThe name suggests that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a spicy dish but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually really flavourful and mild,‚Äù says Munaf. The Chicken Kirim Tikka has boneless pieces of marinated chicken, dipped in egg and bread crumbs and deep fried. ‚ÄoeOr as we like to call it, deep fried in love and affection,‚Äù he adds with a smile. The Chana Bateta Thuli is a popular street food that Munaf‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother has fond memories of, from her growing up years. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chana, boiled potatoes, chutneys, onion, tomatoes and limbu, that we serve with thuli (broken wheat cooked in gud),‚Äù adds Munaf.¬†
Some of the other dishes include Russian Cutlets, Adraki Chicken with Roti, Incredibly Dum Mutton Biryani, beverages and desserts. Alternating between khaaras (savoury) and mithaas (sweet), the special menu sounds like a massive affair, but Munaf promises that in fact, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s quite healthy! ‚ÄoeBohri cuisine is not oily or spicy, so even after this huge thaal, you can have the satisfaction of having feasted on a healthy meal,‚Äù he adds. All the more reason to indulge, we say!
On September 8 and 9, the 15-course meal will begin at 12.30 pm and is priced at Rs 2,199 per person. To book a seat, call: 9819447438.
