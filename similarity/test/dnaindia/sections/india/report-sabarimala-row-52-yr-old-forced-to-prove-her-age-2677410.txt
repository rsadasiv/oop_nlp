A 52-year-old woman devotee from Tamil Nadu was forced to show her ID card to prove her age to enter Sabarimala after a massive protest broke out near the entry point on Saturday following rumours of a young woman climbing the hill to offer prayers.
Latha, who had come with her husband and son, from Tiruchirappalli was trekking uphill on Saturday, when several people started asking her age. A scared Latha took police help which created a tense situation. It defused only after the woman, who had come with her family, convinced the protesters that she was above 50.Â
