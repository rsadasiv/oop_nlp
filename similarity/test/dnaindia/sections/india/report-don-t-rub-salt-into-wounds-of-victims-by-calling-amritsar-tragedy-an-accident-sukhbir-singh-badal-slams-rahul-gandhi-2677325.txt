SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday demanded compensation of Rs 1 crore per person and government jobs for the families of those killed in the tragic train accident here.
Badal demanded immediate dismissal of Punjab minster Navjot Singh Sidhu from the cabinet besides registration of a fresh FIR against his family based on statements of the victims.
He also accused Rahul Gandhi of 'rubbing salt on wounds of the victims'.
.@RahulGandhi, donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t rub salt on wounds of victim families by terming Amritsar tragedy as accident. Visit victims to know 1st hand the criminal negligence of your minister Navjot Sidhu and his wife. Let your actions be louder than words in ensuring justice to affected families.
Congress president Rahul Gandhi also said he was asking the state government and the party workers to provide immediate relief at the accident site."The train accident in Punjab in which over 50 people have died is shocking. My condolences to the families of those who have died. I pray that the injured make a speedy recovery," Gandhi said.
He alleged that Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur was solely answerable for the accident as she was the chief guest at the Dussehra function and responsible for holding such a big event sans security and safety measures.
She has been facing criticism for allegedly leaving the site of accident "without bothering" about the victims.
The former deputy chief minister also demanded action against organisers of the function, saying they were responsible for making the people stand on the railway track.Â
