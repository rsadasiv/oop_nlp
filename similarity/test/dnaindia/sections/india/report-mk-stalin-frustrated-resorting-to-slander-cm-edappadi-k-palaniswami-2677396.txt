With the principal opposition party DMK filing corruption cases against him and his cabinet ministers, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday hit out at DMK president MK Stalin saying that he was on the verge of frustration and was resorting to slander against him.
He also said that his party has unearthed irregularities in the highways department during the DMK regime in 2008 and action would be initiated after consulting the legal experts.
"Stalin tried all tricks (against the government). He tried to topple the government. (During last year's confidence vote), his party MLAs even occupied the Speaker's chair," the chief minister said in Salem.
Responding to reporters' queries on criticism by Stalin in the wake of the Madras High Court's direction for a CBI probe into the road contracts awarded by the Highway Ministry held by him, Palaniswami charged the DMK leader with trying to break the AIADMK and accused him of "instigating" some people within the ruling party. However, he did not name anyone.
"They (DMK) thought that this government will fall after the death of Amma (J Jayalalithaa). They said the party will split, but nothing happened. Things that he (Stalin) expected are not happening. So, he is now sticking to this issue," he said.
Palaniswami denied any irregularity in the awarding of contracts and rejected DMK's allegations that they were given to his relatives. Claiming that proper procedures under the E-tender system were being followed and there was no scope for any irregularity, he said the person who won the contracts had also bagged projects during the DMK rule.
He claimed that the government has come across instances of excess payments made to certain contractors during the DMK's tenure in 2008. Asked if the government would file a case in this regard, Palaniswami said he could respond only after consulting legal experts.
On October 12, the Madras HC had ordered a CBI probe into allegations of corruption in the awarding of government road contracts, giving ammunition to Opposition parties to attack the CM.
