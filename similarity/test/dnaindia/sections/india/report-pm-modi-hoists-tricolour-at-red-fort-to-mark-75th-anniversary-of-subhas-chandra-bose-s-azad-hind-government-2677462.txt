Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hoisted tricolour at the historic Red FortÂ to mark the 75th anniversary of the 'Azad Hind Government' headed by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.Â 
Traditionally, the prime minister hoists the national tricolour at the Red Fort on August 15.Â 
Speaking at the function marking 75 years of the proclamation of the 'Azad Hind Government', the prime minister said, â€oeNetaji had promised an India where everyone has equal rights and equal opportunities. He had promised a prosperous nation which was proud of its traditions, development in all areas. He had promised to uproot 'divide & rule'. Those dreams remain unfulfilled even after so manyÂ  years.â€Â 
Modi had announced on Wednesday that he would join a flag-hoisting ceremony at Red Fort on October 21. Bose had announced the formation of the country's first independent government on October 21, 1943.Â  The Prime Minister would also lay the foundation stone of a museum dedicated to the Azad Hind Fauj.
In a video interaction with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers on Wednesday, Modi spoke at length about his government's works to celebrate the contributions of many personalities who, he said, were neglected by the Congress in its rule of several decades.
"I will have the opportunity to participate in a flag-hoisting ceremony at Red Fort on October 21. Now you will ask - why the flag-hoisting on October 21? I know some people will criticise even this. What is the significance of this day? This October 21, it will be 75 years of Subhas Chandra Bose's 'Azad Hind Government," Modi said.Â 
While the Congress neglected the likes of Bhim Rao Ambedkar, Bose and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the BJP believed in remembering everybody who contributed to nation-building, he said, citing his government's works, including constructing museums for noted tribal personalities and developing five places linked to Dalit icon Ambedkar.
"We respect everybody who served the country," he said while noting that he recently inaugurated a statue of Sir Chhotu Ram in Haryana.Â
