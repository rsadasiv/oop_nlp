Taking a leaf out of Yogi Adityanathâ€<sup>TM</sup>s book, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur is looking for renaming capital city Shimla. According to a report by The Hindustan Times, the Himachal Pradesh government wants to rename Shimla as Shyamala.
Thakur will seek public opinion for the renaming exercise, the report said. Before this in 2016, the then Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had rejected such demands and said that being a global tourist destination, there was no need to change the name of Shimla.
But, the present BJP government and its ministers think otherwise. Himachal health minister Vipin Parmar believes that there is â€<sup>~</sup>no harmâ€<sup>TM</sup> in changing the name.
The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been one of the major voices of changing name of Shimla. VHP state chief Aman Puri says that the British could not say Shyamala properly and hence they changed the anme to Shimla. He says that since India is free country now, we can go back to the old names. Continuing with the names given by the British is a sign of 'mental slaveryâ€<sup>TM</sup>, the VHP said.Â Â 
Last week, Uttar Pradesh cabinet had approved a proposal to rename Allahabad as Prayagraj. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Briefing reporters after the meeting, senior Cabinet minister Siddhartha Nath Singh said, "The renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj before Kumbh Mela came for approval in the meeting and I am happy to say Allahabad will now be known as Prayagraj." "Rig Veda, Mahabharat and Ramayana also mention Prayagraj (for Allahabad)," he noted.
"The people of entire Allahabad, the sages and seers wanted that Allahabad should be known as Prayagraj.Two days back, when the chief minister had chaired a meeting pertaining to Kumbh there, he had himself mooted that Allahabad should be called Prayagraj. All the sages and seers had given their unanimous approval for the same," he had said.
