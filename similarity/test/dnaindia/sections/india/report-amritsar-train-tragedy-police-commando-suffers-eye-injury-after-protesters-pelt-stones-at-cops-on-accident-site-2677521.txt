Protesters clashed with security personnel and pelted them with stones at the Amritsar train accident site after they were removed from the railway tracks, police officials said.
A Punjab Police commando and a photojournalist were injured as the protestors, who were staging a sit-in at the site, started pelting stones and indulged in brick-batting, they said.
The situation is tense at and around the site and a huge police deployment has been made to maintain law and order, they said.
Officials said that personnel from the Punjab Police and Rapid Action Force have been deployed alongside the state police commandos.
The clash started minutes after the security forces removed the protestors, numbering in hundreds, from the track to clear it for traffic, the officials said.
Local residents have been protesting at the site and blocking the railway track since Friday evening when 59 Dussehra revellers were mowed down by a speeding train.
Police are also making announcement on loudspeakers asking people to remain inside their houses.Â 
On Saturday, after visiting the accident site and the hospitals where the injured were admitted, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had said 59 people were killed and 57 injured. Sub-divisional magistrate Rajesh Sharma, however, said 61 people lost their lives.
At the Sunday protest, another local, named Raju, said a man was still looking for the body of his father who died in the incident. "He had gone to collect a piece of cloth to cover the body of his father, but when he returned he could not find the body," said Raju.
Another local, Ram Kumar, claimed that four members of Kajal's family, who are vegetable-sellers, are missing.
Anju, whose brothers Vikas and Ninderpal were killed in the incident, accused leaders of indulging in politics over this incident.
"When everybody knows that Dussehra function had been organised here for the past several years, appropriate steps should have been taken beforehand to prevent such kind of tragedy," she said.
