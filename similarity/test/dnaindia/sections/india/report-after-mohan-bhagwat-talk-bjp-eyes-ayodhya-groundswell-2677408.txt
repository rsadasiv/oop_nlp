After RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's clarion call to build Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, BJP is hoping the issue to turn into a groundswell in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, if not the upcoming assembly elections to five states.
The party is facing an uphill battle in Rajasthan and is going neck and neck with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where it has been in power for the last 15 years. Besides anti-incumbency, agrarian crisis and anxiety amongst upper castes over SC/ST Act could prove to be spoilers. But Bhagwat's push over Ram Mandir could just turn into a much needed shot in the arm the party needed.
"The party has not made up its mind if this should be part of election strategy. It is an issue of faith. But the Congress is definitely in a bind over this. It has already played its card through Kapil Sibal who tried to push it beyond 2019 polls during hearings over this in Supreme Court and now it is our turn to expose Congress," said a senior BJP functionary.
Senior leadership will take a call on this at an opportune time but it is quite clear after Bhagwat's statement that RSS will build up the tempo around Ram Mandir in the coming months, he said. The BJP is confident that the groundwork done by the RSS-VHP combine in the runup to the elections would help consolidate Hindu votes making things easy for the party.
Bhagwat's stance found an echo in Shiv Sena Uddhav Thackeray's speech at the party's Dussehra rally where he declared he will go to Ayodhya and start building the temple if the BJP fails to.
Thackeray's aggressive stance over Ram Mandir has sort of assured the BJP that the bickering ally could be cajoled to stay put in the alliance which Sena has been threatening to walk out from over the last few years.
A senior BJP minister in Maharashtra claimed the Shiv Sena, which has announced its plans to contest the polls sans an alliance with the BJP, could use the issue to mend fences with them before the Lok Sabha elections if the Modi government made moves to build the structure. "Eventually, the BJP and Sena may contest polls together though the Sena may demand better power-sharing terms," he said.
On the other hand, the Congress knows it has a huge battle on its hands in case Ram temple indeed became an issue in the 2019 polls. "We would like to expose BJP for politically using it every time during the elections since 1990.
Congress spokesperson, Tom Vadakkan said, "RSS chief is a very powerful personality and the BJP always listens to him. The question is why was he quiet in the earlier years (of Modi regime)?"
As a Supreme Court decision on the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit is likely to overshoot 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the RSS chief even suggested Modi government bring in an Ordinance.
But according to legal experts, an Ordinance will not be able to stand legal scrutiny. Former Solicitor General of India, Amrendra Sharan said, "One of the basic principles of the Constitution is secularism. Any law which is framed for building a temple will flounder on the ground that it will be in violation of one of the basic principles."
