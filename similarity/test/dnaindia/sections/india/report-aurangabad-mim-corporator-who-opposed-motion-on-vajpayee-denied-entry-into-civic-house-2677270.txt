An AIMIM corporator who was earlier beaten up for opposing an Aurangabad Municipal Corporation resolution paying homage to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Saturday denied entry into the civic house here.
Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that corporator Syed Mateen Syed Rashid was denied entry as other members had opposed his presence at the AMC's general body meeting called Saturday.
Rashid (32) was allegedly assaulted on August 17 after he opposed a proposal tabled in the AMC to pay tribute to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who died on August 16.
Rashid was arrested on August 18 on charges of promoting enmity between different groups, wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot and obscene acts in public.
The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen corporator was later released.
Five BJP corporators were also arrested on August 20 in connection with the alleged assault on Rashid.
Speaking on the issue Saturday, mayor Ghodele said, "In the afternoon today, some members asked me not to permit Rashid into the civic house as he had misbehaved on August 17.
Accordingly, I directed security personnel to stop Rashid's entry, which they did."
AMC officials said that a resolution for the cancellation of his corporatorship was passed in the civic house and a report on it had been submitted to the state government.
The state government is yet to decide on the matter, they said.
