Bio: I am a freelance writer and have been so for the past four months. Prior to this I worked in the IT field for three and a half years. I enjoy writing and give my best to each story or article I pen down.

*A True Dream and A Truer Nightmare* 

‚Äoe Thank goodness it's only eight and a quarter hours before we land. ‚Äù, declared Maria. In response, I made sure that she had a close-up view of all the teeth my knowing smile could afford to show. Within eight minutes, we both knew that Madame Maria would be complaining about how slowly the time passed and had her watch stopped and so on and so forth while I would be submerge myself in the bliss of slumber. To put it short and straight, we were a gaily married gay couple. OK, lesbian couple if you are rigorous in categorizing but we prefer the word gay as it reflects our happiness in choosing to share our lives with one another. The artist in Maria reached out to the writer in me six years ago when she had flown from her hometown, Amsterdam to Delhi for an internship and I was sending stories wherever possible and receiving fluctuating responses. The upshot was that our work complemented beautifully and proved itself in a series of cherish-able comics before we decided to make our personal bond a permanent one. Leaving behind parents in a village 100 km from New Delhi was a hard decision but I knew that Maria and myself could not live as a couple in India and neither did we want to don deceptiveness till our death. Perhaps for the sake of my parents who might have been ignorant of the existence of attraction between same sex individuals, I would have persuaded Maria to live in our house as a friend. But while on one hand, ignorance might have been bliss in their case, the ostracization from society would surely drive them to suicide if nothing else did. I told my brother about my decision and the reason behind it. After a hue and cry and branding me as the blackest sheep and a soulless sinner, he issued an ultimatum that henceforth I was dead in the eyes of all my relatives and dear ones. I rose in indignation to retort but was held back and reasoned into Maria's philosophy that life is too precious to be wasted by letting off unnecessary steam . We left for Amsterdam the next day and began life as a gay couple, pun seriously intended. My last but one thought is that that is my best decision so far, the last being a mixture of hope that my father will recover and excitement of returning to my motherland before I begin to dream, a dream that echoes my hectic yet happy life the last six years.... 

We are in Efteling again! I'm purchasing balloons and thrusting cotton candy on Maria saying ‚Äoe One day break after one year's work, make the most of it.‚Äù She pretends to sulk and suddenly blows bubbles into my face. The next scene in my lucid dream has taken us into the park. A voice screams in delight and I know it's Pradeep as I catch his partner Sumeet whooshing by us in a giant wheel. Sumeet and Pradeep, my best friends and another gay couple who left to India in 2010... They were in constant touch with their homeland and relatives, unlike me who chose to block calls from India on my mobile and spam all emails from there. On being told that in 2009, the Delhi High court had taken a stand for homosexuals supporting their right to live and be treated as humans, these chums of mine took the first flight back to India. They came every alternate August exclusively to see us and forgot Amsterdam till it was time for the next visit. That was them and we loved them for it. Next scene in my dream shows us in front of some kind of a lucky draw competition. Maria has bought tickets and ours has been the lucky number. In some quirky way the judge turns into a clown who then tells us to choose our fairy tale. ‚Äoe Up the Faraway tree ‚Äù, I yell and right before us stands a huge tree which seems to rise through the clouds. With the clown acting as guide we begin to climb the Faraway tree. This tree seems to be home to the best of paintings, handicrafts and classics. The first landing shows a magic canvas that animates whatever you paint on it. Maria picks it up, folds it and puts it into her handbag and also takes some silver and colored sand paints. It's my turn to devour manuscripts and a rare book case that can take in any number of books and still remain light. The clown who so far has been with us asks us to climb a ladder to see what is on the next landing. The steps keep on appearing as we scale them and we finally reach atop. Just then a huge wind topples us and we find ourselves in the middle of a dark room. We get to our feet to find the clown looming over us. His mask blows off to reveal the Grim Reaper... 

The next thing I hear in the nightmare that has just begun is a hopeless, loud wail. To my shock I recognize my friend Pradeep and look up to see Sumeet hanging upside from the ceiling , staring as the Grim reaper glides over to him. A voice booms in my ear, ‚Äoe Get ready for your tests and if the result is HIV positive you join him. ‚Äù ‚Äoe Sumeet is not HIV!!! ‚Äù, I scream. He had his blood tested two years ago. ‚Äoe Accident! ‚Äù,wails Pradeep's voice. Careless blood transfusion last year. ‚ÄoeBut but, treatment...‚Äù, I cry out as Maria and myself are shoved into a room. ‚Äoe You criminals are outside the mercy and protection of law ‚Äù says a sneering policeman as he bangs the door on us. The prison room turns out to be an hourglass sand trickles down steadily on us while our last minutes are numbered. ‚Äoe22 minutes, 21 minutes,20 minutes...‚Äù . 

‚Äoe 20 minutes to land ‚Äù, announced a voice jolting me from sleep. ‚Äoe What is the matter dear? ‚Äù, queried Maria. ‚Äoe Thank god it's over ‚Äù, I sighed in relief as she switched on her mobile. Her phone rang at once and it was for me. The caller was a distant cousin I had met once. ‚Äoe Where on earth are you? Please don't come back. Your father died and your brother has filed a case accusing you of homosexuality. You could be arrested any time, the old law condemning homosexuality is back in full swing. I tried to mail you several times ... ‚Äù. I removed my seat belt before the plane landed, hoping it would crash and release me forever.
