*Beneath The Fenced Waters* 

‚ÄoeThese were to be handed to you by your mother-in-law but unfortunately the task has fallen upon me,‚Äù Devaditya Kumar unlocked his teak wood almirah to take out the ornate boxes. If certain words in his sentence attempted to stand out for their emotional undertones, Devaditya managed to level them like his well ironed shirt. 

‚ÄoeHave a look at them at your leisure,‚Äù the old man said before settling down at his desk with a couple of files and a sheaf of printed papers. 

Priya gently put aside the pile of letters from her admirers as she placed her gifts on the polished table in her new bedroom. She would probably not receive any more fan mails as she had put an end to her singing career with that marriage. But what else could have she done? She was as incurably romantic as the imaginary women to whom she had given a voice through her love songs, which went on to become such a rage across the nation. She could not help but accept the marriage proposal from Devraj Kumar who had ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>stolen her sleep‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> as the lyrics went even though he had clearly explained to her the rules of his household. These were rules that he would not change despite being Oxford educated since they were ingrained in him from such an early age and so effectively, he mistook their complex, round about justifications as the molecular structure of the genes he was born with, which would not leave him till the end of life. 

The young Priya opened each of the boxes one by one, awestruck with the grandeur and finery of craftsmanship of their contents. She had seen nothing like them while shopping during the Singapore trip she had gifted herself and her parents following the success of her second album. Priya, however was unaware that the set of jewellery she liked the most; the one with a sapphire studded necklace, earrings and bracelet, had been originally created for the sister- in -law she had heard about but never met. 

It was during the short period of time when the sun relinquished its heat but retained its light that Devaditya Kumar generally finalized his decisions over the business deals. He  sat in his favourite chair under the shade of a cherry blossom, poring over his laptop placed atop the marble table in his garden while Priya, in the kitchen, inspected whether the saucers washed by the maid were gleaming enough to reflect the tiny beauty spot above her lips. She had an approximate idea of the time Devaditya took to give the final click and the time by which his friend Shankar would arrive, when she would have to appear at his table in the garden with a tray laden with a china teapot, two sets of cups and saucers, spoons, SugarFree and some snacks. Devaditya had never fancied fried snacks like *pakoras* and cheese straws happened to be more to his taste. 

Priya had her tea alone as her father-in-law did not like her hanging around while he spoke to his friend. She was pleasantly surprised one day, when she was asked to sit in his friend‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s place and have tea with him. 

‚ÄoeShankar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daughter has come to visit him with her son. She will be here for a month. Today, they had gone for a family picnic. Lucky Shankar,‚Äù a bitter sigh cut across the trajectory of breathes exhaled by the foreign imported plants of his garden. 

Sip by sip, the tea diminished from the cup like the rays of the sun from the sky and Priya wondered how this very garden would have looked in a music video in such an enchanting hour. But there was something missing from the garden. A water feature? 

There could have been a fountain. Given the amount of space, a swimming pool would be a better idea. 

‚ÄoeYour lawn is large enough to include a swimming pool,‚Äù she said indirectly. 

‚ÄoeSwimming pool!‚Äù Priya regretted saying it on seeing her father-in-law nearly jump in his chair. Within a few seconds she noticed the mellowing of his expressions and felt much relieved. 

Not a bad idea, Devaditya thought. If he had one in his premises he would not had enrolled his daughter for swimming lessons at the club. Women in their house were not encouraged to learn swimming for the simple reason that they were not allowed to wear swimming costumes. Yet Devaditya had relented following his only daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s repeated insistence. He was much younger at that time and he could have taught swimming to her himself, if there had been a pool in his compound. In that way she would have never met the swimming instructor at the club. 

People had flocked to see film star Sheetal and the large departmental store under the Kumars banner was filled to capacity like the giant teddy at its entrance stuffed to every square inch with cotton. Who could have been a more suitable celebrity to inaugurate the kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s section than Sheetal, who was currently promoting an animation film for children? The film on the nearly extinct land phones, where Sheetal  had given voice to Tring Ring, a female land phone, had already generated a lot of curiosity. The crowd and the publicity were the fruits of Devraj‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s efforts in reaching Sheetal through the layers of PR persons and managers who encircled her like the coils of a film reel. 

Devaditya looked elegant in his new brown suite though he and his son refused to be photographed by the media. Sheetal, in her white top and black skirts posed for the cameras alone against the multihued backdrop of the new section named Play Turn. The young actress also choose this occasion to mention the children who made her life special, the little boys and girls at Twinkle, an NGO she patronized. 

The huge mass of people started moving out at a leisurely pace after Sheetal exited with a baby pink basket of gifts. Most of them had come in groups. The space throbbed with their collective chatter as they noisily departed, having a lot of opinions to exchange regarding how Sheetal looked in real life, the extent of her genuineness, assumptions about her personal life and all the speculations triggered by the yet to be released movie trailers. Some of them stayed on, to shop or window shop. Devraj was having a discussion with the floor manager while Devaditya waited for his niece. She had arrived from Berlin that morning. He would show her around this store before taking her for lunch to his restaurant at Bluebells Street. 

A loud crash made him look towards his right. A boy of around seven-eight years of age had dropped a glass vase while trying to reach out for a toy from an upper rack. The vase was not supposed to be kept among the toys and Devaditya guessed it was the work of one of those perpetually broke, college going window shoppers, who fiddled with a lot of things but bought none of them. However, the boy would have to pay for the broken item as excusing him might discourage the others from being more careful. 

With many pairs of eyes on him, the little boy looked somewhat uncomfortable, causing Devaditya to feel a bit sorry for him. The boy had almond shaped eyes like Devaditya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s and his hair colour was brown rather than black like Devaditya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s used to be before they turned silver. 

‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be afraid my child. Just ask the person who has come with you to speak to this ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. ‚Äù Directing towards the shop attendant nearest to him, Devaditya spoke very gently to the boy, unintentionally using the voice he had reserved only for particular occasions like the gold brooch in his locker. 

Having faith in his employees, Devaditya did not pay attention to the conversation between the attendant and the boy. Browsing through varied, colourful objects in the new section, Devaditya, an ardent devotee of Bajrangbali wondered whether the merchandising of Hanuman dolls like He-man dolls would merit an approval from the version of scriptures constituting his belief system. Even then, he admired the craftsmanship gone into the carving of details such as the tiny rivers, miniature trees and miniscule animals in the hill held within the outstretched hand of this factory manufactured Hanuman. 

Devaditya was jolted out of his musings by a female voice saying, ‚ÄoeHello‚Äù on the other end of a phone line. 

The boy had come to the store, accompanied by two teenage girls from his neighbourhood, who were not carrying the money required to pay for the vase. The shop attendant had asked the boy for his parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> number but being extremely busy, putting back several misplaced baby clothes in the correct shelves, he had made his junior colleague dial and put the phone on speaker. 

‚ÄoeMrs Sinha?‚Äù 

This particular Mrs Sinha among the many hundreds in the city sounded a little perturbed that she would have to pay one thousand rupees. However she agreed to come and pay, saying it would take her only fifteen minutes to reach the shop. 

By the time, the shop attendant ended the call and asked the boy to sit on one of the stools fashioned like dices, Devaditya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s senses were no longer echoing the realities of the room. He had the dazed look of a man, gaining consciousness after being pulled out from the rubble of an earthquake. Like a thread of glue from a pressed tube, the voice continued trailing a line in his mind, across torn away bits of letters, joining up the missing years for him. Devaditya felt like hugging the boy, lifting him in the air and showering him with all the fascinating objects in his shop. For the first time in his life he felt like initiating an interchange of words that would go on forever. He wanted to know which games exhilarated him, which books enchanted him, whether his school delighted him or was it a pain? Whether a holiday was an occasion to rejoice or  crushed with an unreasonable load of homework? He wanted to delve deeply into every other detail motioning or halting, jutting out of or blending in the supposedly smooth flow of a childhood. 

Devaditya had kept his and his son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s names away from the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Events‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> section of the newspapers where the inauguration of the kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s corner by Sheetal Khanna was announced. Few knew who owned this months old establishment, the latest of his ventures. Rajeswari might be mad with joy on seeing him after a decade. Would she try to leap into his arms like she did as a little girl? No, he could not let that happen. His employees were unaware about his personal life and he preferred it that way. He could not allow a reunion to occur in front of people who were oblivious of the separation in the first place. Rajeswari might also start weeping if she saw him. She was a stupid, emotional fool. Otherwise why would she do what she did when there were far more suitable men to choose from? Unpredictable as she was, she could also try to punish her father with her silence, with her lack of expression or maybe just a glare. Devaditya would not like that too; to present her an opportunity to impose her own wordless judgement on him, lest he betrayed any signs of being affected by its impact in the presence of his staff. 

There was a way he could still meet her without creating a scene. He could wait outside for her in his car like he had done so many times before, when he used to pick her up from school. 

Devaditya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s forefathers and Devaditya himself  had lived one after another like ribs in a rib cage. This was their way of grasping the somewhat insurmountable thing called existence. Rajeswari was the one who had untied herself from the rope that had fastened her to the norms of their household and instead flung it around to guess her distance from whatever she could touch with its end. Surreptitiously testing, she chanced upon a soft glimmer of sensations, independent of anything she had known. Finally when she had not only touched the stagnant water but rippled it to break its stillness, it was as good as being washed away by the flood, too far. 

Devaditya dialled his niece‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s number. ‚ÄoeNishi, I was so busy this morning that I had to skip my breakfast. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s have lunch first. Then I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll bring you to my shop. Have you left from your house already or shall I come over to pick you up?‚Äù 

Devraj was still deep in conversation. ‚ÄoeYou must have lunch with your cousin now. You can get back to this discussion later on,‚Äù Devaditya put his palm on his son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shoulder. Devraj looked surprised as he had told his father just the day before that he would not be able to catch up with Nishi before 9 PM. Devaditya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s glance conveyed to him that there was some important reason behind his insistence. He had always followed his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s footsteps without asking too many questions. This time he followed him out of their store, a few minutes before the most important woman in his life other than his wife and his late mother, entered it. 

Devaditya let himself be driven out of the street in his car, not waiting to meet his daughter nor noting down her contact details from his grandson who sat patiently in one corner of his huge departmental store.
