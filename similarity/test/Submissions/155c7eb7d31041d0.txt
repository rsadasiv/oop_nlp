Fifty-Five 

â€oeIs it actually my sweetness that makes you use these epithets for me, or is it you who brims with a lot of love?â€ â€oeWhat difference does it make? Isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t it one and the same thing, or at least, a side of the same coin?â€ â€oeStillâ€¦â€ â€oeThis question makes sense only if you want to be loved by someone else when you leave me.â€ â€oeShut up! You know how much I love you.â€ â€oeOr it may be the fear that I would leave you one day.â€ â€oeAm I the only one who is showered upon so much of your love?â€ â€oeSo this is the fear.â€ â€oeNot fear, but I want to hear it from you.â€ â€oeWhat if I lie?â€ â€oeYou wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t. I trust you.â€ â€oeDo you see these tattoos on my body?â€ â€oeThese are too many. Why do you like them so much?â€ â€oeThey are fifty-four. I get a new one inked every fortnight. There is a studio in Delhi.â€ â€oeYou are crazy... how much do you spend on it?â€ â€oeIt costs me nothing. It is a bet that I win each time and the guy inks me free of cost.â€ â€oeWhat is the bet about?â€ â€oeâ€¦that Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll visit him every fortnight.â€ â€oeWhat kind of a bet is this?â€ â€oeIt is my kind of a bet.â€ â€oeYou still seem strange to me.â€ â€oeI know, but this is the way I am. It has just been a few days. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll know me well in a few days.â€ â€oeWhy do you keep recording my voice whenever we talk?â€ â€oeIt takes a while to get inked. I shall listen to it while it is being done.â€ â€oeWhy were you asking about that girl yesterday?â€ â€oeI just asked you if there was any girl around whom you did not like.â€ â€oeBut I saw you talking to her this morning.â€ â€oeIt was something about that boy who inks tattoos on my body.â€ â€oeWhat has he to do with the girl I dislike?â€ â€oeYou will know that too.â€ â€oeDonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you think it is too early for us? We have met just a few days ago.â€ â€oeI can turn around if you wish. We have come only halfway.â€ â€oeYou said you had work in Delhi, and you will lose the bet too if you do not reach Delhi in the morning. I am just a little worried. Being alone in a city I have never been to gives me goose bumps.â€ â€oeI shall leave while you are still asleep. You will scarcely leave the bed before I reach Delhi. And Karnal has a number of malls. You will hardly realize how quickly five hours are gone. I shall pick you around 3 PM. Buy a beautiful pair of jeans for yourself and keep this cash.â€ â€oeYou are so caring. I trust you fully.â€ â€oeSleep for a while if you want to. It will take another hour to reach Karnal.â€ â€oeI shall rather talk to you for an hour.â€ â€¦.. â€¦.. â€oeThis is a beautiful room. Isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t it?â€ â€oeI stay in this room whenever I come to Karnal.â€ â€oeThe ambience here is too good.â€ â€oeWill you like to take a bath? I am going out for a while.â€ â€oeYea.â€ â€¦.. â€¦.. â€oeYou took a long time. I have been waiting.â€ â€oeI was finding something good for you. Do you like this pink one?â€ â€oeItâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a beautiful nighty. You have an immaculate choice.â€ â€oeHereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the menu. Choose something to have and order it on 229. I shall be back after having a quick shower.â€ â€¦.. â€¦.. â€oeYour skin is flawless. It was lovely to be with you tonight. I shall never forget this evening.â€ â€oeThis is a new feeling. I am ecstatic to have felt you but I also feel as if I lost something.â€ â€oeIt must be virginity. You bled profusely during the first bout.â€ â€oeI found you recording the sounds while we were between the act.â€ â€oeI told you what I record this for.â€ â€oeYou are obsessed.â€ â€oeYour eyes shine. I am sure you are happy. We can have it once more.â€ â€oeHmmâ€¦ You look tired.â€ â€oeYea, a bitâ€¦ It is 1:30. I should get some sleep now.â€ â€oeI want to sleep in your embrace. Be with me tonight and always.â€ â€oeCome on.â€ On 9 Jun 2016 23:40, "à¨ªà¨°à¨®à¨¿à©°à¨¦à¨° à¨¸à¨¿à©°à¨<sup>~</sup>" <parmindersinghaziz@gmail.com> wrote:
