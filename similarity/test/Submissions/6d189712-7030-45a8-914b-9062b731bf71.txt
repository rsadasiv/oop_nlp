 â€<sup>~</sup>Why should I?â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>Because, as women, we are more in touch with our emotions and feelings and therefore we are more capable of empathy than men. As long as he is a good man otherwise, I think you should stop being so stubborn.â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>But I am a feminist. And as a strong, independent woman who recognizes gender inequality, I believe it is my duty to change the world by setting an example. He has disrespected me for months now, and I cannot take it anymore.â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>You know I am also a feminist, but you have to realize your husband is not the world. You are not changing the world by defying your husband. You canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t destroy your relationships for your cause. Feminism needs a place and a time and proper measures.â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>Why do you stop your car for ambulances to pass, in a country where adjacent cars donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t care about you or about the ambulance? Why do you pay the maid extra money every time she asks, even when you know she will never return it? As a doctor, why do you choose to work your butt off in the social sector and live on a pittance when you could just open a clinic serving the rich and make easy money?â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>Because you want to make a small difference. You believe in these social causes and you want to live by certain principles to help tip the scales in favor of the underprivileged. So why does gender-inequality go by different rules for you?â€<sup>TM</sup>  

â€<sup>~</sup>Okay Okay miss know-it-all, enough for today. I have to go back to watching CSI.â€<sup>TM</sup>  

I was always a loner, an introvert. I loved people, and was always fascinated by human behavior but I never could understand how to make friends. Most of my days and nights were spent locked up in my dark room, rummaging through the internet for virtual friends or the next best indie song to make me feel alive. Maybe it was the consequence of being the sibling of a first-born male in a middle-class south Indian household. Or maybe it was the education system that never worked on children like me- I never really could manage to pass any subject. I wrote well though, and sang well , and danced well, and was able to understand and connect with almost anybody - all with ease. But none of it mattered because from a very young age, I was told by people who were in charge of my growth that I was stupid because I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t do well in school. So I abandoned all my â€<sup>~</sup>silly hobbiesâ€<sup>TM</sup> and focused on trying to beat an education system and a society that was so hell-bent on crushing my soul.  

As I passed the age of 18 and entered â€<sup>~</sup>adulthoodâ€<sup>TM</sup>, I encountered a lot of crossroads when I could have given up this pointless pursuit of societal validation, but I persisted because I was stubborn in my belief that I could prove myself if I worked hard enough(thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s what everybody else was doing, I thought). I sought the help of a lot of â€<sup>~</sup>successfulâ€<sup>TM</sup> people to point out to me what I was doing wrong. They helped me in the best way they could, they said: â€<sup>~</sup>youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re sleeping around too muchâ€<sup>TM</sup>, â€<sup>~</sup>you drink too muchâ€<sup>TM</sup>, â€<sup>~</sup>pretty girls like you shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be smoking 8 cigarettes a dayâ€<sup>TM</sup>, â€<sup>~</sup>get marriedâ€<sup>TM</sup>, â€<sup>~</sup>do another computer courseâ€<sup>TM</sup>. So I spent years devouring articles and books about how to quit smoking, spent years in fitness and yoga and good nutrition and meditation, in understanding men and how to be a good partner, worked hard on every friendship and relationship I had - all the while letting my career stagnate because people said I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t grow if I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t kill all my â€<sup>~</sup>bad habitsâ€<sup>TM</sup>.  

Fast forward to 10 years later, and a lot had changed to my outside personality. My social life flourished, I was always the centre of attention among friends, people loved having me around, I did really well on Tinder because I could connect with men easily, I had understood the whole dating game. But addiction isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t conquered easily, especially when the you have still have problems inside that you havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t addressed. I had managed to improve my self-esteem to a level where as long as I had a man who loved me, I could keep my addictions in check. So I got married to one of these men who, in his words, liked my passion towards feminism and liked that I was an independent liberal in spite of being from a conservative household. I loved him for 5 years before he finally asked me to marry him. But by then I was quite exhausted of â€<sup>~</sup>givingâ€<sup>TM</sup> to a man who didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even know what my favorite book was. I had developed and nurtured a small inner voice in my head to tell me when I was doing something that wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t good for me, because maybe subconsciously I knew nobody else could ever be there for me- not my family, not my friends; subconsciously I knew that nobody even knew who I was. But when it came to finally deciding to get married, I shut that internal voice up and listened to all the voices around me, because they were family.  

Planning a wedding changes you. It teaches you who REALLY cares about you. You stop nitpicking over peopleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s intentions and take any help you can get. I never thought that the one person who would be there for me while I slowly but steadily turned into a monster bride, would be my sister-in-law. In the end, my wedding became more of a mirror for me to see the kind of person I really was, rather than the best day of my silly life.  

Anyway, I said goodbye to my old life in India, left behind all my insecurities and abandon, and moved to a new country for this man who I thought wanted to be my husband. Things went south pretty quickly, he would routinely question my abilities at life or tell me about how some other chick looks so much better than me. It didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t matter to me because I was just happy to be around him. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d waited 5 years to be with a man like him. I started getting better at things really fast. I was able to fit in with his â€<sup>~</sup>coolâ€<sup>TM</sup> friends, I was able to manage the chores and make time for myself, and I was able to survive with basically no friends of my own for months. And still he treated me the exact same way as he did the first time we met. I began to understand who he really was, as I watched his true personality unravel into the version of â€<sup>~</sup>imperfectâ€<sup>TM</sup> he always blamed me to be. There was no love in my heart for him anymore. Slowly, I realized what Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d done for myself. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d married a man with the hope of seeking his validation. I had become those women I laughed at.  

I still remember my brotherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s wedding 3 years ago, I knew that my brother was being extremely insensitive to Chaitraâ€<sup>TM</sup>s feelings, I knew that what my parents were making her do was wrong. I knew that I would never put up with the shit that she was putting up with. As a person in a position of some power, being the groomâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sister, I could have done or even just said something. But what did I do? I stayed quiet and watched. I watched her suffer and I laughed a little inside. Because it made me feel powerful.  

And she was there for me. She let me live with them with no restrictions about interfering in her relationship with my brother, she helped me with my relationships and my struggles with life. She loved me for who I was and recognized the beauty inside me, and never once expected anything in return. And I gave her nothing in return. All I could do was buy her an iPhone. Now that I face a similar reality she faced, I carry the burden of guilt over not having done something for her when I could have.  

She used to be an extremely strong woman when my brother first introduced me to her 5 years ago. She would always stand up for her opinions openly, always speak her mind, call you out on your bullshit (man or woman). Now sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sobered down. She tells me about toning down my voice so weaker men donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t feel insecure. She tells me to be more forgiving to people who hurt me out of ignorance. She tells me it will make me a better person. The thing that hurts me the most out of this experience is not the humiliation of being married to a man who disrespects me, not that my own brother did this to another woman, but the fact that the world lost another strong woman because I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t keep my ego aside.  

But, the thing with humiliation is, it teaches you to love unconditionally. My suffering is nothing compared to the countless women who have suffered and are still suffering to much higher degrees in the hands of this sick disease known as patriarchy. If I let this slide, who else will fight? This is not a fight for my freedom. This is a fight for all those countless women who silently suffer every day. So what if I am not an activist in the traditional sense of the word? So what if the only activism I have done is on Facebook. So what if my family disowns me or my friends laugh at me? At least I know that when I am old and ready to die, I would be happy knowing I gave back to society just a little bit. What else is there to life?
