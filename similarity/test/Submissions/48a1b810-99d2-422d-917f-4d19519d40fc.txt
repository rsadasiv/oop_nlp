<p>Lying in bed one night, Sebastian Martin looks up and swears something just moved. "Did you see that?" he whispers, nudging his wife. Sushila is drowsy in the curve of his arm but opens her eyes and reminds him that he was born with a caul over his face, a thin, clear membrane that the doctors brushed aside so he could wail his way into the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So what?" he asks, confused.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Didn't anyone ever tell you," she says, her lips tickling his skin, "that it means you can see bhooths, djinns, ghosts, souls wandering in limbo?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Oh come on," he says.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She smiles into his shoulder. "Have a little faith," she murmurs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's not faith," he replies, his body tense, "itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s nonsense." But she's asleep again, a shadow against white sheets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day, he goes to the optometrist to see if his pupils are as they should be-perhaps there's a minuscule tear in his cornea, some anomaly that gives the illusion of flight when there is none. His doctor, a beefy man with pale hands, says no. "It all checks out," he says and beams down at Sebastian. Sebastian blinks back. He considers getting a second opinion but changes his mind when he stops at a pharmacy and sees rows of reading glasses, no prescription necessary. "Can I wear these out?" he asks the saleswoman who nods, peels the bar code sticker off and checks him out right there-$10.99 and he's all set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That evening, when he walks in, the house is steaming with cauliflower and cheese. A casserole with a burnished golden top rests on the counter. Sushila is on the couch, sipping wine. She's washed her hair, he can tell, by the way it coils neatly around her ears. "Hello," he says, startling her. Her head rises abruptly and her eyes widen. A little frisson goes through him â€" even though they've been married four months, the routine of coming home to her is still new.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She points to the glasses. "How come?" she asks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Oh," he shrugs, "these are just to help with the strain on my eyes."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hmm...." She tilts her head to the side and smiles, "you look very handsome."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peering into the mirror above the couch, he sees how the dark frames carve his cheek bones into angles. Her reflection joins his. A hand reaches up to jostle the glasses lightly against his nose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Don't do that," he says softly. When she lifts a hand again, he stops it with his.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But you're tense," she whispers, and kisses the clenched muscles of his wrist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm not." He wraps his arms around her, lowers her to the floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For gods sake," she giggles into his cheek, "take the glasses off."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He keeps them on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afterwards, he helps her wind into a gold sari, holding the edges as she turns into it, and drapes it over her shoulders.</p>
