I clutched my mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s duppata, and hid behind her. The body was burnt brown and looked as if it was tearing into ashes. She yearned for breath while the air mask was put on. Even though her one eye was glued to the skin, she smiled with joy when she saw me, with her other eye half opened

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> was my recently 90% burnt aunt, as I put it in doctor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s language

Only last week while we were returning to our respective homes after the big fat Bengali wedding of my cousin, we met my aunt and uncle in the railway station. I feel Howrah station contains half of Bengal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s population, because that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how crowded the station felt. My aunt, unable to find any spot to sit, sat down on top of her suitcase; meanwhile my uncle was feeding her jhalmuri (every Bengali passenger‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best friend)

My mother had no idea that they were to catch the same train as ours; however, now that we discovered it, we decided to stick together until the train arrived. I went and sat down on aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lap, and uncle gave me a packet of jhalmuri too. They looked the perfect ‚Äoetrue-love‚Äù old couple that internet pictures show you

Uncle never let aunt do any work, not even household work. My mother always wondered how she was so slim, without doing any work at all; she was jealous and secretly wanted to discover her secret. However, I always used to wonder if something was wrong. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know if I have some problem with happiness, because when I see things too rosy I start doubting them

Everyone has ups and downs in a family, how was this family so perfect

Now when I see my burnt aunt lying helplessly in the hospital, I become sure of my doubts and surer about the fact that the world isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t such a rosy place for anyone. What happened, no one knows except me. Did I tell someone? No, because no one believes a dream

We got into the train and settled into the seats. We were in the same compartment, but our seat was quite far. I was not one of those children who keep running and disturbing the whole compartment, I barely uttered any noise especially when kept busy. I was sitting in the seat above and making different shapes with clay, my mother recently gifted me fun school clay set

Dinner was to be served soon. My mother told me to get down. She was urging to take me to the washroom, but I was an eight year old grown up girl and demanded to go to the washroom alone. So I walked towards the washroom, I thought I would meet aunt on my way. Both aunt and uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seat were empty

I sat down on their seat for sometime, because I read somewhere in the station that we must never leave our luggage alone. I was getting really scared by now. Weird thoughts were coming into my mind. What if they fell down from the train? What if they got locked inside the washroom? One long bearded man whose seat was next to aunt and uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seat came and told his wife that both the washrooms are locked, and asked her to go to the washroom after some time. I assumed that aunt and uncle must be in the washroom. However, when I was opening the door to get out of the compartment, from the glass I saw aunt standing towards the train door and uncle scolding her. I had never seen uncle like that. His eyes were red and his hand was around aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s neck as if he wanted to strangle her. Aunt was crying and folding her hands. I was scared, she would fall down...but I was scared to go outside

Aunt saw me, and she said something to uncle. Uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s red eyes immediately turned from red to their normal black. He moved back, and pushed aunt away from the door. He was telling something to aunt; it looked as he was consoling her. Then he turned towards me, and smiled. Even though it was a smile, somehow it reminded me of all those evil stepmother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in Disney princess movies

He came and told me that aunt wanted to sit on the stairs and he was pleading her not to; I looked at him in disbelief. He understood that, and kept persuading me to believe in his words. His words sounded so hollow, and so did he. Aunt came to me and told me that uncle was right, she looked at him and said, ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry I will do whatever you want me to do.‚Äù Aunt held my hand, and took me back to my parents. She told my parents that I was with her the whole time. One more lie, lies are the starting to something bad. Something was wrong, but I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t figure out what. After dinner my mother took out that box in which she had kept the sponge cake

Mostly whenever we travel, my mom makes carrot or sponge cakes, this time it was the sponge cake‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s turn. She told me to go offer some to aunt and uncle

I was a little apprehensive at first, because of what I saw earlier; however, when my mother persuaded me I agreed. The curtain was drawn. There were angry murmuring sounds. I moved the curtain a little bit and peeked inside. Uncle thrashed aunt so hard, she fell down. I clenched my hand on my mouth. He caught her hair and made her stand up. He said, ‚ÄoeIf you utter a word to your relatives, I will kill you.‚Äù He stormed out and went towards the door outside. Thank god he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see me. I went inside and aunt started wiping her tears with her sari pallu as soon as she saw me. I asked her what was wrong, and urged her to come with me to my parents. She took my hand in hers, and looked at me straight in the eye, ‚ÄoeDo not tell anything to anyone, until I ask you to...do you understand?‚Äù I had never seen her like that, I nodded my head. Uncle returned. My whole body shook in fury. He looked at me and smiled, like he does always. Aunt forced a smile and said, ‚ÄoeShe came to offer this cake her mother made.‚Äù Uncle pulled my cheeks and said that I was a sweet girl. He told her, ‚Äoego the washroom is free now.‚Äù Aunt looked at me, and signalled me to keep quiet. After she left, uncle asked me, ‚ÄoeDid aunt tell you anything about me?‚Äù I shook my head in denial. He seemed to breathe a sign of relief

He told me if I liked colouring, I nodded and he handed me a diary and pen

He told me draw in that. I had seen aunt writing in that diary before, but it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem uncle knew about it. I thanked him and ran to my parents. A single moment there and I would have started crying. I wanted to tell my parents everything, but then I remembered my promise. When I make a promise I never break it

After some time my parents had gone to sleep. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to sleep and tossed and turned into the seat. Sometime hit my neck. I got up and saw it was the diary which was demanding my attention. I opened the diary and started reading. It was my aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s diary; her whole life was wrenched out in it

In one page she wrote about one month before the wedding. Uncle came to the house past midnight with a bottle in his hand, barely able to stand up. She was helping him stand up. He pushed her back hard, her head hit the wall

He told her that he was ‚Äoethe man‚Äù he needs no help from a weak creature like her. Weak creature, what did that even mean? I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand then, but I did understand that uncle beat up aunt regularly. Most of her diary pages were filled with the abuses he hurled on her

Another page was the diary entry from today morning. She narrated how her husband had spotted us entering the railway station before. He then started to care for her and feed her, to make us believe what a great husband he was. She wrote how he acted so caring and forced her to tell everyone that he was the one who did all work, when the reality was absolutely contrary to it

One page caught my attention. There was a danger sign made on that page, and blood spots filled the page. I turned the page to read what was written

Dear diary, I am very scared...I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what to do. My daughter whom I raised with so much of care, whom I protected when my husband wanted me to abort her, has betrayed me. She was my source of compassion...my source of joy. This husband and son of min have poisoned her mind. She speaks nothing but the language of money. They all want me just for my money, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what my husband married me for, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what my son and daughter want from me now

They want me to write all property in their name, I know, they shall throw me out of the house as soon as I sign. But they threaten to kill me if I do otherwise. Either ways I shall die. Inside the house, I shall die from the hands of those I put my faith in...Outside house I shall die the death of a stray dog. My whole life has been spent according to the whims and fancies of my husband and now by children. But I shall write the story of my own death...no one else shall do that. I will pen down my own death

I was going to read more; however, someone opened my curtain that moment

It was aunt, she was gasping for air, she had come running to me once she found out the diary was with me. She asked me if I read anything, I denied and said I was only drawing. She relaxed, snatched the diary from me and bid me goodnight. Next morning we got down in our respective stations. Aunt looked at me and smiled before leaving. Everything was unsaid; despite our age gap we understood each other‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s feelings

The day when we heard about aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeaccident‚Äù we boarded the train again, to reach to her place. It was a long ride, and I slept off as soon as we boarded the train. Aunt was calling me. She was wearing her favourite sea green sari, her long hair open and flowing. There was fire everywhere...but no flames touched me. She was wrapped up in flames, but there was a smile on my face. ‚ÄoeLittle one, tell them...tell them that I won.‚Äù I shouted and asked her to jump out of the fire. The more I shouted...the more the flames rose

She shouted, ‚ÄoeGo tell them, they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win this time, they wanted to burn me down to get that paper signed...now they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t burn me down to death, I will write my own death...tell them I won...tell them little one.‚Äù I woke up startled. It was all a dream, I was sweating. My mom noticed me and thought I was disturbed about my aunt. I tried telling them what I saw; they kept saying ‚Äoeits okay‚Äù and ‚Äoeyour aunt will be fine.‚Äù Now when I enter aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> room, and see her smiling, a tear rolls down from my eye. She called me and handed me a paper. She whispered, ‚ÄoeGo give this to him...and tell him what I told you.‚Äù I went to uncle who was whining loudly, all relatives were gathered around him. I handed the paper to him, and told him the last thing aunt told me in my dream. He shouted loudly, all his fake crying started at once. He shouted, ‚ÄoeHow could the bitch do this to me, she ruined me completely.‚Äù I turned back to look at aunt, she was looking straight in uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes...and then she lay still. Finally aunt wrote the end to her story

Later when we were returning home, for all relatives this was the topic of discussion. My mom phoned her mom to tell what had happened. She said, ‚ÄoeHe was acting to be a good husband the whole time, you should have seen how he reacted when he saw she had donated all her property to the orphanage... we all think he only must have burnt her, but now that she is dead we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have any evidence or else we would have done something.‚Äù I sighed, if only I had the diary, we could have proved everything. I closed my eyes and saw my aunt. She called me and said, ‚ÄoeLittle one I did it, I wrote my own death, I won.‚Äù
