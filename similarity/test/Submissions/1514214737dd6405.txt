A Cold, Square Patch of Sunlight 

Bapi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother is dissatisfied when she sees him storm into the house, throw his school-bag with complete carelessness to one side, and gulp down his milk and jhal muri in an exuberant and restless haste. 

‚ÄoeIf you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t chew properly, you will get indigestion,‚Äù she calls out in her scolding voice, but Bapi is already moving out of earshot. He does not even have time to change out of his school uniform. He stops at the door for the brieftest moment to shout back: 

‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to meet Thakuma‚Äù. 

God knows what happens to him when November comes, his mother thinks to herself as she clears up the tiffin plate. For everyone else in the sleepy town of Rabindranagar, there is nothing special about November, other than the fact that it signals the onset of a largely unwelcome winter. For Bapi, however, November seems to come as a month full of promise, and Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house becomes an irresistible destination. 

Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house is an unsightly apparition that lies at the end of the street. It is a run-down place that has seen better times. It is crudely cordoned off by a broken, wooden fence. There is a weedy garden in front: a few tended flower patches surrounded by snaky outgrowths of creepers and ferns. Whatever paint is present on the walls is in dirty splotches, a result of the repeated buffeting of rain that it has received over the years. The only distinguishing feature of the house is its large, protruding verandah, fronting a rusty grille that is locked at all times. 

It is a dark and forbidding place. Perhaps it was impressive to look at in earlier, happier times, before it fell into its current state of irreversible decay. Now it exhibits an eerie, desolate look. It would not be out of place in a ghost story, or a horror novel, with unpleasant shocks lying in wait in its dark rooms. 

It is towards this house that Bapi runs with great intent, launching himself along the dusty street, kicking stones right and left, landing at the gate with an eager bound. There is no calling bell of any kind. So Bapi rattles loudly on the verandah grille and cries out in his shrillest voice: ‚ÄoeThakuma! Thakuma!‚Äù. 

This insistent exhortation is followed by a slight spell of breathless waiting, and then the inner door creaks open and Thakuma slowly emerges from the inky darkness, tucking in her white sari as she crosses the cold verandah floor. She is a broad-faced woman in her seventies, with wrinkled, dry skin that hangs from her face, like the folds of her saree. There is something ominous about her features, accentuated by a sharply curved nose, like the beak of an eagle. To a stranger, seeing her for the first time, the effect of her appearance is quite startling, especially when one adds the rheumy but sharp eyes that ceaselessly dart this way and that on her face, sizing everything and everyone up. To Bapi, however, who has known her all his life, there is nothing frightening about Thakuma. He waits impatiently as she unlocks the grille and slides the latch open. 

‚ÄoeCome, Bapi,‚Äù she says in her throaty voice. She points at a little stool on the verandah. ‚ÄoeCome in and sit down.‚Äù She recedes into the darkness of the house, while Bapi kicks off his black school shoes and stretches out on the verandah stool. 

She emerges a minute of two later, holding in her hands a silver tray, which she places on the floor while she seats herself carefully, taking care that the three little boxes, and the green betel leaves on the tray do not fall off. 

Thakuma casts a practiced eye on the large collection of betel leaves on the tray and extracts the two largest and greenest specimens. She rips off their trailing stalks, and then applies little dollops of creamy white chun on them. She does this with some care, because adding too little of the processed lime would fail to impart flavour, while adding too much would burn the tongue. Bapi sits in silence through this performance, munching a little on the discarded paan stalks, as Thakuma adds areca nuts and coconut strips and roasted fennel seeds to the leaves. She twists the two leaves, bursting with this collection of condiments, into narrow conical triangles and presents one to Bapi, while she tucks the other into the corner of her mouth. 

The old woman and the little boy sit in silence for some time. It is a quiet afternoon, and there is no sound other than that of paan chewing. A sense of contentment spreads through Bapi, but his eyes soon start to wander towards the east end of the verandah. 

‚ÄoeDo you think Birenda will come today?‚Äù Bapi asks at last. With the paan out of the way, his excitement has returned. 

‚ÄoeWe have to wait and see,‚Äù Thakuma is always noncommittal when it comes to the topic of Birenda. The day is cloudless, however, and as Bapi and Thakuma watch, a little square patch of sunlight starts its journey from the east wall of the verandah towards the center. 

‚ÄoeYou have to sit quietly as the patch makes its way across the floor,‚Äù says Thakuma, her voice trailing ever so little as she leans forward. 

Bapi watches, as he always does, with bated breath. The movement of the square patch of light is slow and steady. It elongates into an oblong, then into a shivering rectangle, before recovering its shape and rising along the west wall of the verandah and exiting the house. 

After the patch leaves the verandah and the house, Bapi turns to Thakuma with a look of eager expectation. 

‚ÄoeWhat did he say?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeOh, he was not very communicative today.‚Äù 

But Bapi cajoles and insists. He is sure that Thakuma is holding back and presses for news that Birenda has surely brought with him on this trip. 

Thakuma finally relents a little. She leans back against the verandah wall and stares ahead at the opposite wall: ‚ÄoeWell, he did say that the weather will get cooler over the next few days.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat else,‚Äù asks Bapi, ‚Äoewhat else did he tell you?‚Äù 

Thakuma evades the question, and makes a show of rearranging the boxes on the paan tray, but Bapi knows that there is more. He pesters her insistently until he has extracted nugget after nugget of what Birenda has discussed with Thakuma during the course of his brief visit to the verandah. 

‚ÄoeHe told me that he has added some twigs to his house.‚Äù Birenda lived on the uppermost branches of a large mango tree in the woods beside the dhan khet. 

‚ÄoeHe told me that the vegetable sellers will be bringing a last set of mangoes next week, before the season is completely over.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHe told me that the Mother Dairy Milk Booth caretaker is dishonest and will soon be caught by the parar dadas stealing milk and giving it to the local doodhwallahs.‚Äù 

Filled with these portentious pieces of information extracted from Birenda, Bapi walks back home to change and go to play. Often, when Birenda has some prediction about Rabindranagar, he shares it with the other boys he plays cricket with. 

His friends are scared of the old lady and avoid her house, but they listen with rapt attention as Bapi recounts the details of his latest encounter with Birenda. 

‚ÄoeCan you ask Birenda who will win the next World Cup?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBirenda talks to us. Thakuma and I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t talk to him.‚Äù 

Sometimes Birenda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s predictions look wild enough for the boys to be a little skeptical. Bapi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends are less than excited when the days pass and nothing happens at the Mother Dairy Milk Booth. The caretaker remains safely ensconced and no nefarious activities are unearthed by the parar dadas. 

For a while. 

And then the news hits the town like a hailstorm. In an innovative raid in the early hours of a Saturday, Bimalda and other dadas had ambushed the caretaker of the Milk Booth while he had been transferring milk in a large cylindrical container to the local doodhwallah. This unmasking of the caretaker is the talk of the town for days afterwards. The delicious whiff of scandal wafts through the tea-shops of the main street and the hair saloons and the evening gossip sessions of the housewives at the Kali temple. 

Bapi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends look upon him with new-found respect, and he has a spring in his step when he goes to visit Thakuma the next day. 

On this occasion, however, he finds that the afternoon is cloudy and there is no square patch of light in the verandah. This is a disappointment, especially because Bapi knows that when December arrives, Birenda would come and leave by the time he is back from school. There would be no patch of sunlight at all during the summer months. 

‚ÄoeDoes Birenda not come at all during the summer?‚Äù, Bapi asks Thakuma, consoling himself with an extra paan in Birenda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s absence. 

‚ÄoeOh, he comes,‚Äù says Thakuma, ‚Äoehe comes as a cool breeze during the summer. During the monsoons, he announces himself with water droplets that sprinkle on the verandah.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeDoes he always bring you news about the para,‚Äù asks Bapi. 

‚ÄoeNot always. Sometimes he just visits to say hello. He has been here a very long time. Long before these streets existed, long before the dhan khets were heavy with grain.‚Äù 

One day, when Bapi arrives home from school during a summer day, he finds his father seated at the dining table, nursing a fever and taking a break from work. 

‚ÄoeYour mother tells me that you often go to meet that woman in the house at the end of the street.‚Äù 

Bapi feels terrified, like when he lost his chappals at the maidan facing the Kali temple and his father was furious with him for a whole day afterwards. 

‚ÄoeWhat do you do at her house?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWe‚Ä¶ we talk to Birenda sometimes.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWho is Birenda?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBirenda lived in Rabindranagar a long time ago. Then he died. He now lives on top of a mango tree near the dhan khet.‚Äù 

Bapi uncertainly provides more details about Birenda to his father, while his mother stands at the threshold of the kitchen. He keeps his gaze on his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s feet, not daring to look up as he describes Birenda and his predictions. When he finishes, he steals a look at his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face. It bears an expression of great sternness. 

‚ÄoeListen, this is all nonsense. There is no Birenda, no tree house for your ghost in the dhan khet, no predictions about the town. Nothing! All you have is a crack on one of the verandah walls in that house, a crack that lets light in. Your Birenda is nothing but a cold, square patch of sunlight. This woman has found a way to amuse herself with you, and fill your mind with rubbish. Stop going to her place!‚Äù 

His father says many more things, but Bapi half listens and half steals a look at the door every few minutes, hoping to escape this terrifying tirade against Thakuma and against Birenda. But, at some point, a little defiance creeps into his heart, and he finally finds enough courage to look up and say: ‚ÄoeBut Birenda told us that the parar dadas would catch the caretaker at the Milk Booth!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThat caretaker is a known thief. He was kicked out of his last job before settling at the Milk Booth. She may have heard of it from somewhere. You are a fool to believe her!‚Äù 

The next day, Bapi tells his mother that he is going to the maidan to play, but runs off instead to meet Thakuma as usual. 

‚ÄoeMy father says that there is no Birenda,‚Äù he says, as Thakuma prepares the paan. 

Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hands move with practiced ease, sniping off the ends of the paan leaves. 

‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t listen to anyone who says Birenda does not exist.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThen why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I see him or hear him?‚Äù Bapi complains, finding some of his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disapproval in his own voice. ‚ÄoeI have been here so many times, but only you can see him and talk to him. Not me.‚Äù 

Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face assumes a look that is inscrutable. She digs into her tray for some supari that she munches on reflectively. 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see him. I feel his presence. You need a special gift to sense Birenda, to hear what he has to say. No one else has that gift in Rabindranagar.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHow can I feel his presence?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know. Maybe you never can. You are becoming like the others.‚Äù She fixes her eyes on the twelve year old boy and says with a little shrug. ‚ÄoeYou will grow up and feel that eating paan is bad for the teeth and talking to ghosts is silly.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeDid Birenda tell you this as well?‚Äù 

Thakuma does not answer this question and Bapi leaves her house with his mind filled with discontentment. 

This dissatisfaction pervades his entire consciousness in a way that he is unable to shake off. When he gets off the school bus the next day, and the day after that, he finds that his feet drag on the dusty roads of the town, as he sets his unwilling path for home. After munching on jhal muri, he does not bound away towards Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house, but goes off directly to play listlessly with his friends.  There is no magic in his games, no mystery in his life. He eyes wander sometimes towards the end of the street. But he is unable to go back. 

On one occasion, after his game is over, his feet take him towards Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house. It is twilight and in the dim light, he makes out her silhouette on the verandah. She sits with her back to the wall, splicing paan leaves. Her legs are stretched out in the direction of the opposite wall. He slinks away without approaching the verandah. 

One Sunday, he finally decides to take matters into his own hands. He walks with a decided step towards the dhan khet. It takes all the courage that he can find to cross the wet lowland and reach the cluster of trees on the opposite side. He has chosen the brightest time of the day, when fears are most easily quelled, and stands as tall and fearless as he can when he calls out to the uppermost branches of the mango tree at the edge of the wood. 

‚ÄoeBirenda! Birenda!‚Äù 

There is no response from the tree, from Birenda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nest. None at all. Bapi repeats his call, but there is less conviction is his voice this time. His calls get more and more feeble until finally, he turns, crestfallen, away from the tree, as a stork disengages itself from a dark inner branch and flies over his head towards the dwellings. 

There is an emptiness in Bapi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life that is new to him. He has had several fights with friends, but they had all been resolved quickly and painlessly. But this is different. He gets his first lessons in realizing that sometimes when a cord of friendship is strained, it may take a long time to mend, or not mend at all. 

But, as the days and months pass, Bapi also learns that change is something that he is able to adjust to, as his world expands to include new interests at school and at home. And so, it is the sprightly and high spirited Bapi of old who runs back from his school bus on a bright November day of the following year, to gulp down his jhal muri and milk. But, this day, Bapi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother has some bad news for him. 

‚ÄoeThakuma has been taken ill. She has been shifted to the hospital. Her son has come down from Metiabruz to attend to her.‚Äù 

This news leaves Bapi feeling numb and heavy. He walks from his house to the maidan fronting the Kali temple and wanders aimlessly for some time. There is a chill in the air, even though it is afternoon. He finds a spot that is not shaded and lies down, exposing his cold hands and feet to the warmth of the sun. 

Bapi stays in this position for some time. Then, on a sudden impulse, he gets up and starts walking at a brisk pace towards Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house. The road is full of stones that he kicks at absently. There is the gentle swish of a breeze on his back to hurry him along. When he reaches the grille of the old house, Bapi finds his voice. The shrill, excited voice of childhood. ‚ÄoeThakuma! Thakuma!‚Äù 

It is not a call but a demand and Bapi knows that it will not go unanswered. Finally, the inner door opens and Thakuma emerges from the inky darkness of the house, tucking in her white sari as she crosses the cold verandah floor. 

‚ÄoeOh Bapi, you have come‚Äù, she says. 

‚ÄoeThakuma, I had to come to see you.‚Äù 

Thakuma walks with slow steps to the grille and unlocks it for Bapi. 

‚ÄoeCome in, come in. Let me bring my paan tray.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeMy mother said that you were ill and had been taken to the hospital.‚Äù 

Thakuma says nothing as she selects two leaves of paan and proceeds to apply just the right amount of processed lime to the leaves. 

‚ÄoeThere are many people at the hospital‚Äù, she says as she offers Bapi the paan, ‚Äoebut I prefer to be here with you.‚Äù 

As Bapi tucks the paan inside the corner of his mouth, his head turns expectantly towards the east wall of the verandah. 

After a little while, the square patch of sunlight makes its appearance on the wall. 

‚ÄoeBirenda is here today!‚Äù says Bapi with delight. Thakuma leans back and sighs. 

‚ÄoeHow could he not come?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄoeHe wanted to meet us too.‚Äù 

Bapi watches, transfixed as always, as the little square patch makes its way across the verandah floor. But this time, something is different. He feels a prickling at the inner edge of his mind, a feeling that emanates from something that is warm and close, yet very far away. It accompanies a sense of loss, as the paan melts in his mouth and the patch gradually becomes oblong, then rectangular, then waspish thin before rediscovering its shape on the opposite side. As it rises along the west wall of the verandah, Bapi finds himself getting up to cup his hands on the travelling patch and feel its fleeting warmth. He wants to trap it and stop its progress. But the patch rises and rises and eludes his fingers as he stretches himself. Then it is gone, and his hands feel nothing but the coldness of the coarse, blackened, ridged surface of the wall. 

Bapi looks at the tired face of Thakuma as she leans her heavy frame against the verandah. 

‚ÄoeI felt his presence this time, Thakuma, I really did.‚Äù He says. Then he adds, with a touch of wistfulness, ‚ÄoeI know that Birenda will never come back now. Will he?‚Äù 

Thakuma says nothing but continues to stare at the west wall where there is nothing. Just a shadow of a trace of an outline of a memory. Or, perhaps, nothing. 

Bapi gets up and without any further words, he quietly leaves the verandah and walks away from Thakuma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house. When he reaches the end of the road, he finds himself turning back to look at the place. The last image he carries back with him is of a grilled verandah that is barred from entry with a large, strong lock, and of a house that has grown dark and forbidding with the oncoming of twilight.
