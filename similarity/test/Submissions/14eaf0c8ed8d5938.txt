Bio: Sharanya Deepak is originally from New Delhi and now lives in Brussels. She used to dream of being a chef, and realized her impotence in the kitchen and made do with her amateur ability to write. She is not very sarcastic, overtly idealistic and exaggerates a great amount. "Career" is her least favorite word. After working with Tehelka Magazine at a young age, Sharanya went on to write for online news journals and dubbed herself as a 'content creator' to make money to see the world. The world has been great, for now, but she knows no other place like home. Sharanya wrote her first book for children in 2013 published by *Duckbill Books* and is currently working on her second.

20 SOMETHING 

‚ÄoeTypical Brussels‚Äù, Jordan stated seriously, as they stood at the train platform, mouths open to first sun in a week. Razia shuffled uncomfortably as she thought about the very European temperament she had acquired. Moods determined by weather. Smiles conditioned by sun. 

A little boy was singing to the train tracks. Typical Brussels, Razia thought. Brussels was queer. Unpredictable. A glitch in Belgium‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s otherwise linear progression. She thought about New Delhi, people singing to train tracks, others chasing pigeons, others in conversations that escalated from serious to hilarious in mere seconds. New Delhi was a land of queer. 20 million comic, romantic fools locked into one city space. But Brussels was an experience to the rest of Western Europe. A quick glimpse at multicultural chaos before crossing the border to structured order. 

Razia walked across statues, the large noisy road from the centre to the north, cringing when she remembered moments spent at them with her favorite person in the world. She quickly put them out of her mind. ‚ÄoeNo time for pain! People are DYING IN EAST TIMOR!‚Äù, her new friend Julien had yelled at her drunkenly from his window. His hair stood up on his head and his oversized flannel fit his shoulders perfectly.  She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really know him, but he was the kind of boy that invoked fondness. He was nervous, anxious, constantly doubtful of everything. Yet maddeningly kind. He spent his time posing on windowsills, a cigarette carefully dangling from his mouth. 

‚ÄoeHa. Tragic Frenchman‚Äù, Razia had said to him, but he hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understood. She had watched him‚Ä" sleepy and bored, firm cheekbones, hair effortlessly falling on shoulder, and seen the definition of the word ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>handsome‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. 

‚ÄoeTypical Brussels‚Äù, she thought now everytime she looked around. Mixed age crowds listening to Brazilian jazz, young students in long shirts eating Moroccan pancakes, a Sudanese woman shouting the same word thrice that to her sounded like ‚ÄoeYou burnt the bread!‚Äù. 

She liked it here. 

She had walked her Ma around her neighborhood, her neck at the phone screen because she never knew how to position the laptop right. The neck had nodded disapprovingly as Razia showed her the Turkish neighborhood she lived in. ‚ÄoeAll the way to Europe to live with Muslims and prostitutes‚Äù, a shrill voice had said. ‚ÄoeJust come back baby, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll give you a head massage‚Äù. Razia had laughed, fighting back tears, craving a head massage and her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hands on her head. She was coming to visit in a month. Her first time out of the country, probably expecting from Europe what Razia had. 

Perfection. 

‚ÄoeWhat do you think about Europe then?‚Äù, was everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s favorite question to ask. She had practiced an answer that pleased most. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice‚Äù, she would say and then pause purposefully. ‚ÄoeWell not nice, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s interesting. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m glad I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m here.‚Äù. And they would nod approvingly, cultural value added to their lives by this short conversation with a middle class Indian. Most of her friends back home were resentful of the Western earnestness for cultural experience. But Razia liked it. Prolonged generations trying to justify historical inequality. It was quaint. Naive. A bit pointless too, this hankering for knowledge of the east. She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think they could understand. But she told them anyway. She explained to them the caste system. Did she eat beef? Did she believe in arranged marriages? She did!? Could she tell them why? 

Often she got tired of these questions and enjoyed the profound triviality of conversation with her friends. Borderline racism, condemning romantic choices, conversation she could never remember the next day. They had formed friendships over debauched walks through bars, packs of cigarettes chain smoked together. Mutual heresy. 

They were four. Always together. But not anymore. 

Times had changed. Spaces had switched. Her world had shifted. 

Unhappiness was deep this time around. More intertwined. Harder to get rid off. Sunshine didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help, music seemed too distant. When she was younger, it was all a sort of theatrical. Escalating moods, reckless mistakes. Bittersweet! Important, even. But now it was simply inconvenient. Deep set. A crisis, she thought. This was what it was. Crisis! She felt old but juvenile at the same time. A 20 something. She watched the couch of other 20 somethings, inebriated, clueless, and thought it was maybe this time in one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life. 

20 something. 

She felt all the cliches shape her. She hated her job, liked the city she lived in, idealized her friends, drank too much, fell in inconvenient love. 20 something. She wondered if any of this would make good stories. She could tell her kids. 

‚ÄoeSmoked too much, wrote too little, travelled a good amount.‚Äù 

She often saw herself wanting to sit in the sun, dog in hand, waiting for someone to arrive from work so they could talk about their day. She craved stability, but didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know how to execute it. She thought about her friends in New Delhi, 20 somethings, doing 2nd Master degrees, and wondered what she was doing so far away. 

She thought about New Delhi‚Ä" wild, uncontrollable, beautiful New Delhi and felt pangs of pain in the middle of her stomach. She would often stare out her window and hold her hands in prayer, wishing to walk out the door and be at home. She would run to the window, hoping somehow, for rickshaw horns and salwar kameez clad aunties on their morning walks. 

Or she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lay in bed, turning towards the window and wish painfully to wake up to her friends screaming at each other. They would be hysterical in each other‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s company, determined, invincible, obnoxious, full of blatant confidence that only came from unconditional affection. From irrefutable friendships to deep set loneliness, was this supposed to teach her something? 

‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the weather‚Äù, the couch of 20 somethings concurred. 

What WAS she doing so far away? Scrubbing fish sauce of pans for money, being yelled at by a spiteful older woman, making polite conversation with wonderful strangers. Why wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she home? With her friends strumming a guitar to a song she hated. Why wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she at writers meetings, peaceful protests, pretentious parties. New Delhi seemed so far away when she wore her apron and bent to fill the rice cooker with cheap rice. ‚ÄoeCheap Thai food for all!‚Äù, the board yelled. 

CHEAP. She hated that word. 

Why was she counting change at the grocery store? When she could be racing in her car, an important Indian woman, one that knew things, had seen things. Why wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she at parties with journalists discussing politics? What had made her leave? 

"√,,pni mulk ki khushboo jaisi koi aur nahin hoti", she remembered. Here the streets did not sing. The wind blew above you, not touching you. Western Europe. Everything was outside your grasp. And no one seemed to mind. 

These questions answered themselves when she was sat around a table discovering Kosovo was a country. She knew now that Cuba was severely oppressed. She did not see anymore the magic in oversized vintage coats. She despised HnM. The West had taught her a few things. Strength, appreciation for her own, broadened her mind. She had aimed to live a cliche but enlightenment had come in a hard, cruel way. Most importantly, she had fallen in the deepest love she had ever known, one that sat inside her head stubbornly, one that parted the clouds and shelled her stomach. 

But had it been worth it? 

Would she ever go home, they asked her often. She would, of course. She loved home. Sitting in this cafe, trying to answer this question, she tried to explain her country, the way it was piled up like a house of cards, magnificent but volatile. She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the words. ‚ÄoeYou have to go see‚Äù, she told them. How could she tell of infinite kindness and endless mountains. ‚ÄoeIt is profound‚Äù, she explained to a group of Italians, who looked at her in a mixture of awe and confusion. Razia made do with Jordan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s supporting nod from the end of the table. The Englishman got it. 

They would sit around watching people and voicing thoughts for hours. ‚ÄoeYour issues are surprisingly English‚Äù, he would tell her. And she would wonder aloud if colonialism left behind thought processes. Indian middle class anxiety, with kind regards from the British. They would make historical jokes. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pretty soon, isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it? For us to be sitting here talking nothings?‚Äù, one of them would say, and the other one would agree, two 20 somethings on the street in Brussels, defying history. 

Razia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only solace was her small balcony. A terrace, they called it in Brussels. It looked out to other terraces, you could never see far away sky, you never could in Brussels. She felt closed down, and small. She even felt the fear of god. Instead, she shut her eyes and imagined being on a fast road in the mountains at home, hair flying in wind, the air smelling like rain, everyone impatient to stop and drink chai. Why was she on a small terrace in Brussels, when she could be racing on the streets in Mcleod Ganj, Himalayas in clear view. There was a small hook in the street she lived on in which the mountains suddenly came into clear view. She would often sit on this hook, chai cup in hand, and watch people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s faces as they approached the mountains. People would scream in delight. ‚ÄoeDekh, oye!‚Äù, someone would scream, ‚ÄoePAHAD!‚Äù, like they never had before. The mountains always stood there, looming, majestic, matter-of-fact, like it was just ordinary to be that large and magnificent. She opened her eyes as her Turkish neighbor hung her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clothes, five pairs of identical shirts and trousers. She smiled and waved at her, dark eyes under flying white trousers. 

What was she doing here?  In trams full of unsmiling faces. 

She was in love, she had claimed. But it had been without return. Unrequited. he had expected it to be slow and profound, like a Billie Holiday song. But it had been tiring and swift. Pointless, but important. He was her best friend, understanding all references and creating technicolor memories. Razia was a diseased optimist, never thinking about failure. She had lived with a naive trust in the universe, dismissing all possibilities that did not end in colorful coherence. He called it unfair that she had put all her expectations of the world in him, and her expectations were so many . That she was bound to fail. It had been wonderful, challenging, till it had left her doubtful and incomplete. 

But today was good. There was a street party against too many Private Parkings in the centre of Brussels. Many nationalities had gathered in her living room to discuss the various implications of the Greek crisis. Brussels was happy today. The sun shone, families danced, everything was very quaint. ‚ÄoeTypical Brussels‚Äù, stated Jordan again from the corner, grinning at her widely, pleased that everyone fit into sketched types. 

‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good to be young today. Lots to know. ‚Äù, she heard someone say. ‚ÄoeThey say one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 20s are one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most important time in one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life‚Äù, she heard another voice narrate. 

It was good to be young today. Bright orange sun, epiphanies, inscrutable solitude, all arriving at some determination to make it as someone, somewhere. 

20 something! She would tell her kids‚Ä" 

‚ÄoeSome days were good. It was probably the weather.‚Äù
