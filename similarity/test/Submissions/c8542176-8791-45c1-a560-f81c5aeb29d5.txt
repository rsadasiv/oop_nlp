The city had passed through an intricate sequence of protests and retreat, a week of gathering at the center of city in the rainy month of September. Romila's camera had captured it in glaring detail. Around hundred interviews of participants of the protests were recorded and stored in gigabytes of hard disk drives. Much as she wanted to start editing the interviews, she knew deep down the lack of a coherent narrative that the documentary had in her head. She had captured the protest in detail and its participants' words with rigor but she had practically no footage before and after the protests.

Romila didn't film everything continuously like her friend Deepti who would carry a camera around every second of her waking life. Deepti was the reason Romila started to develop an interest in the camera and its craft.

Deepti after spending years on social media with her elaborate performance realized that the camera could well be used to capture everything, every moment, and it would in the process increase the probability of landing up with good, interesting footage.

Romila accompanied Deepti to a small protest gathering in early July at College Square, where Deepti scoped the whole meeting.

After the protest Romila turned towards the lens and asked "Deepti, don't you keep an archive of all the footage that you capture?"

"Not really. Storage is costly you know. I can't afford new hard disk drives and monthly payment for cloud storage. I try keeping as much of the good stuff as possible. Also, sorting through so much of the footage I have realized that I might not actually ever end up watching all the stuff I film. There is a lot of trash. Lot of redundant, repetitive stuff."

Romila nodded her head but she couldn't quite understand Deepti. Romila went out of the frame. What if Deepti saw the look of hesitation on her face in the film. What if she did rewind the footage and saw all the frames of her facial expression, her emotions, frame by frame.

"Deepti's uncontrolled filming is voyeuristic but the fact that she isn't actually archiving all the footage is interesting. All she enjoys doing is peeking through the keyhole, and the whole social media experience of sharing." Joy opinionated while sitting on an antique chair on the second floor of his two-floor zamindari inheritance.

"Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s certainly paradoxical if you think about voyeuristic practice and ubiquitous filming. If one films one's whole life, and doesn't watch it, what kind of banal voyeurism is it at all? Maybe filming is extremely banal in today's world--taken for granted, too mundane. The lens, the artificial eye, like a pacemaker." Joy rambled on, stroking his beard and looking outside of the window and picking up the glass of drink.

"I think I want to try film something. Do you think you can help me edit the work if I have some good material at the end of it?" Romila asked hesitantly.

"Certainly."

The camera panned across a crowded street with loudspeakers blaring. The camera moved towards the source of the sound, a loudspeaker on top of a truck with the leader's voice echoing through the concreteness of the planned urban landscapeâ€"bodies moving on a road surrounded by massive old built architectures and street vendors. The camera passes through numerous bodies shouting slogans. As the camera approaches the truck the frame pans across the frontal limit of the rally headed by cameramen with huge cameras walking backwards and in distance lay a barricade with water cannon and policemen and policewomen of the state and city, in brown and white respectively. Esplanade crossing is in the horizon of the frame.

On the day of the mass rally in September, Deepti's social media was updated with a total of 53 photographs which included 7 selfies and over six hours of video footage. Her footage was extremely mundane, filming the day from her point of view. Most of the video was generated to be shared with her followers and viewers on Periscope. Her images were posted and shared on Instagram which was also linked with her Twitter and Facebook profiles. Her images gathered a total of 765 retweets on Twitter and 398 shares on Facebook on the day of the rally.

"What you need is some sort of a follow-up to the protest. Right now, most of the footage that you have is too euphoric, being obviously present within the mass rally. The characters are not interesting, as they all seem to sound the same. We are also not very sure about their political affiliation among the various political parties, organizations and splinter cells. The rhetoric of all the interviewees sounds the same. Some follow up footage would be nice, to have a deeper sense of a narrative. Unless obviously, we edit it in an experimental manner and make some form of installation art of it." Joy said looking away from the computer monitor.

"No, I think I want to develop a narrative. A traditional film. We can do all the experimental stuff later. We will play with the archive later. Life is long to waste thinking about the archive right now," said Romila.

"What about using Deepti as one of the central anchors of the narrative, considering she has so much footage before and after the protest?"

The idea had crossed Romila's mind before, but she didn't find Deepti to be an interesting character for her film. She wanted to follow up with the leaders and the cadres who arrived truckloads from the mofussils. She didn't want to spoil Joy's enthusiasm hence refrained from passing a comment.

After Joy edited Deepti's footages of the few days in an around the day of the rally, there were only a few frames, scenes, that mattered.

The camera hurriedly runs through one room to the next where the sound of the default Android ringtone is coming from. Deepti picks up her cellphone from the bed and sits down. The camera pans haphazardly across the room and settles with a frame half capturing an almirah and a window through which a grey skyline of dirt laden buildings and a few high-rises is visible.

"What happened?"

"You need me to go there right now?"

"First aid and water? Okay." CUT TO

The frame is a of an auto-ride. The camera is beside the auto-driver. The camera moves out of the auto and heads towards a metro entry/exit.

"Stop the camera. Don't you knowâ€¦" CUT TO

Deepti hands over the water bottles and a packet of random assortment of food and first aid to a person and the camera pans all around the crossroad barricaded. CUT TO

Tear gas shot. Crowd disperses. CUT TO

Running. Indistinct crowd chatter. CUT TO

A loudspeaker announcing in the distance. "Tomorrow a massive rally shall start from College Square and we shall capture and hold the Esplanade crossing indefinitely." CUT TO

Images of the rally. Chatter of slogans. The camera pans across the crowd.

At Esplanade crossing. CUT

The footage runs out.

"Did you get the interviews of some of the leaders?" Joy asked after showing Romila the rough cut he could salvage from Deepti's footages.

"Yeah. Footage of a few leaders. Followed them around for the past two weeks. Lot of fly-on-the-wall footage."

"Are we close to being done?"

"I don't think so. The protest was massive. It was a massive gathering but the narrative lacks any sense of purpose. If we are to tell the story of a failed movement, even by that standard the footage doesn't hold ground." she said. She got up from the chair and looked out of the window. The sun was going to set soon. She had to head back home. "Have you read Rajni Bakshi's book The Long Haul, about the mill workers strike in the 80s in Mumbai?" she turned towards Joy and asked.

"Yes. I have."

"The narrative of that protest is possibly the best example of a narrative of a failed struggle. The constant refrain in the book if you remember was that of the debate between spontaneity and its fruition into something with or without leadership. The question of leadership was central to the narrative but not in a Great Man way. It plays with our todayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s anarchist fantasy of decentralization, of spontaneous protests against a purposeful channeling of the desire and will of the people."

"The primary Leninist questions, yes. I remember clearly, 'socialists call strikes a school of war but a school of war is not war itself'. Yes. This was the problem of the protest in many ways."

"Not just that, Joy."

She approached his bookshelf and looked through the middle shelf. Picked out a torn copy of What Is To Be Done? She flipped through some pages.

"Listen to this." Romila quoted a long passage about the problem of spontaneity and vanguard leadership from the second chapter of What Is To Be Done?.

"This problem of the people's will and its potentiality, it's thwarting, the directionless pursuit of social movements against the hope of success of a movement, the purposeful channeling through a leadership which brings with it its own problems is going to be the central theme of my work. That day when I kept interviewing people at the rally, I didn't know why I was filming. I was looking for a story, not knowing that a strike or protest on its own really lacks any story. There is no story there unless one has filmed before or after the protest. It's emptiness. A mere protest of emotions and behavior. I think I have established the setting, all I need now is to flesh out my character.

"Look at this". She took out her camera, plugged it into the computer.

The camera moves through a mofussil landscape. She fast-forwards through a lot of the footage. The camera moves quickly across many roads and faces talking. She decreases the speed to 1x. A loudspeaker echoes in the soundtrack. The frame is of an indistinct crossroad. "The success of the September protest has shown us that people still have the revolutionary spirit among them. It's time to continue the momentum. We cannot back down, our faces are on all police cameras, social media. It's do or die now."

She paused the player, disconnected her camera.

"He is my protagonist. His name is Subhra. I already have hours of footage with him. From now on I will film him. If he dissolves into obscurity, is a charlatan or turns out to be a people's leader is none of my concern. I shall remain objective."

Joy smiled. "How will you know when to stop filming?"

"I think I will know."

"What if it takes years?"

"I hope you are willing to be in this for the long haul?" She laughed.

The camera pans across numerous faces on the street. The loudspeaker drones. The sky is deep blue. CUT TO

The camera captures bodies moving on the street from a top angle. CUT TO

A man is sleeping on the footpath with a small kid sitting and watching the road with bodies marching past, visible through the blue and white railing. The loudspeaker drones in the background announcing imminent revolution in muffled, echoed words. CUT

Deepti's followers across all her social media profiles increased roughly tenfold following the rally. She works as a digital marketer for an advertising firm. She still films. Everything.

Romila films Subhra.
