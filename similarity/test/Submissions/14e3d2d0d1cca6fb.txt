Resurrection 

I had already spent 40 years 8 months 3 days and a few hours on this earth when I chose to end my first life by disappearing into a Muniyara, a megalithic burial chamber.  Time froze, stuck at that moment when I slid down through the rocky opening on the side to the ancient dolmen and dangled, clinging on frantically to the serrated mouth till I had the courage to jump down. I existed in a limbo for some time and was not sure whether there was a second chance for me. The smoky, shadowy environs of the underground tomb crept into me and coagulated as a dark abscess within, questioning my sanity.  The absolute stillness throbbed around me battering me into numbness reducing me to a flaccid, wilted bloom. In the ensuing time, which seemed to me like years, while I lay bruised on the rough, cold floor of the rocky crevice, thoughts came back hesitantly and I relived my entire life thrice over. I would have drifted off to sleep in a while and woke up to the suffocating, sickly sweet fragrance of the devil‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tree flowers.  Disoriented and anxious, I wondered whether I was in a dream. Pangs of anxiety coursed through my veins when I had the familiar sensation that it was too late to start my chores for the day. 

The dial of my watch gleams eerily, telling me that it is 6 o‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> clock in the evening. Past the rocky dolmen I am hiding in, past the devil‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tree and the bushes and the neat compound dotted with plants and trees, I can visualize the white bungalow which had been my abode for almost 17 years. It is almost time for my daughters to return from school. What will they do?  Will they look for me or get irritated to find the dining table devoid of the customary tea and snacks? I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to think. 

You might not have understood where I am and what I am even now. This pleasant December evening, instead of being in my garden indulging in the loveliness of my motley, multihued flowers and the silken touch of frilly butterflies, I am here, in the dark, suffocating interior of the Muniyara, a sub terrain megalithic dolmen in the farthest corner of our compound. Within these slabs of granite, roughly slapped together to form a kind of a cavern, a shadowy world seeped in the aura of an ancient civilization, I have distanced myself enough from my people.  I will tell you how I came to be in this uncomfortable reminder of the remote past that taunts me for being such an insignificant creature in the general scheme of life. Before that you have to know who I am to understand my reasons for choosing to spend a few days alone in this Muniyara, away from life in the usual sense that we all understand. The foremost reason is that this corner of the compound is the last place anyone will look for me.  Secondly my husband will never send anyone to this side of the compound simply because he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want anyone to know about the existence of this ancient burial chamber. 

You  know now  that I am hiding from my family. 

I am Radha, all of 40 years in age, mother of Samhita and Karishma, both 16, and wife of Unnikrishnan, CEO, Inspire Inc. a fortune 500 company in the city.  I have been a good mother to my beautiful, intelligent daughters all these years.  My husband, whom I call Unniyettan, is the typical executive who charms anyone with his suavity and verve.  They complete my world. My parents are no more and being a single daughter I have no siblings to turn to at this hour of need. What I have is a hoard of unnecessary aunts and cousins who are mostly jealous of my affluence and seemingly perfect family. They are a nuisance really, with their sly comments and snake oil concern. Unniyettan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s extended family is the same. 

Through the crack on the top left of the chamber a sliver of painted sky glints beyond the swaying coconut palms. An occasional bird or two cross my bit of sky every now and then to provide some diversion to the lonely vigil. A chameleon, still sobering from a flame red to the dull grey of the rock has been my only companion in the chamber so far. A suspicious crow has been peeping into the darkness, crassly cawing its anger, in a futile attempt to recover an unwieldy, slushy chunk of papaya which had plopped down and splattered on the floor of the cavern. 

In the farthest corner of the Muniyara stands a Megalithic burial urn or a Nannangady.  In the shadowy darkness, it glows eerily emanating an oily sheen through the layers of dust and years gathered on it. It is almost a metre and half in height with a stone slab to protect its narrow top and the story of the humans who crumbled inside to fine dust. I am sure it might have bones, but no one has bothered so far to open it and find out. Fragments of pots cracked to smithereens lie scattered on the floor. In the company of mysterious remnants of unknown ways of life centuries ago and ancient souls, I am able to think clearly. What I am trying to do is salvage whatever is left of my life. You might call this burial chamber an odd place to start a new life. Strangely, this might be the only place that can offer me the necessary space I need before taking any decision. 

Where will I start my story from? The first sixteen years of my marriage may not be of any interest to you as I can sum it up in a word- mundane. Not that I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t had my moments of joy. I led a quite commonplace life as a wife and mother fulfilling all my duties and tolerating all the indignities of having no life of my own. My life had been tied up with my husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s and my daughters‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> needs- exams, promotions, illnesses, birthdays, dishing out tasty meals relentlessly‚Ä¶ Whatever, I remained the victim. All those years I plodded through life dispiritedly while they took away my soul and crushed it with their indifference. Now that I am breathing another kind of air that tingles with freedom I am coming out of the vacuum of inertness I had been cocooned in. 

An officious, black and white advertisement in the newspaper two months ago transformed into a door and showed me glimpses of the tall and willowy Radha Menon, who was the topper in her graduate class.  For a brief moment I saw her liquid eyes glittering with laughter. There was no dearth of suitors including the Financial Theory lecturer Dr. Ram, the heart throb of all the girls.  Why did she choose to be the obedient daughter? Why did she marry a stranger whom she had met over a cup of tea in her ancestral home in Kannur? Would life have been different for her if she hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t made her mother happy by complying with her wishes?  But the radiant girl who had given her hand to Unnikrishnan, her eyes glinting with the sparkle of the medal she had received for topping her masters course seemed to be another person from another life. 

It was that Radha from the past who extended her warm hand through the black and white letters of the newspaper and touched me with the stardust from the past. She made me regret the role of resident housekeeper (taken for granted), which I had willingly accepted in the initial days of marriage. 

Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think that I was a grumpy wife and mother. But along the way, somewhere, the vivacious, zestful Radha was replaced by a docile woman who cooked, cleaned and was chided umpteen times a day by everyone at home. Over the years the lustre, the confidence and the charm got replaced by a frozen, duty-bound, servility. Official calls, tours and the never ending struggle for the next promotion had always been the primary concerns for Unniyettan, my husband. My daughters were both busy with their cell phones, friends and growing up. Mostly I held a one-sided conversation with these busy people and got absent minded nods or cold, piercing silences as responses. Emboldened by the glimpses of my old self, I decided to take up the opportunity to try for a doctoral degree and go back to my beloved books. It might even lead to a career, I hoped. 

It took days of cajoling and convincing to be allowed to apply for the qualifying test for doctoral research. Unniyettan was churlish, but being used to his tempers and nastiness I was quite unaffected. My daughters giggled and warned me not to insult them by pretending to be a college student. It might be difficult, so don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t keep high hopes; they advised me in their slippery, girly voices trying to camouflage the malice. 

I pulled out my old books from long forgotten trunks in the attic scattering broods of ugly, speckled lizards with the help of Shankaran, the gardener. In the spacious first floor hall, a new study corner was created overlooking the lush green paddy fields and the hills beyond. During the day, when I was alone, I rejoiced in the company of my old books and new journals ordered over Flipcart. I tingled, bloomed and celebrated the excitement of my college days and the passion for a subject that let me enter into its intricate alleys of wisdom without any resistance after such a long gap. 

A month into studies, my applications put in though after some difficulty in acquiring references from my old professors, I was deliriously happy. Whenever I looked into the mirror, I saw the old Radha, with those shining eyes. I hurried about with my chores and did not fail in my duties. But I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t waste time lingering around my daughters struggling to start that nonexistent conversation or fretting at the absence of a loving man in my life. 

Three weeks into the qualifying test, something bizarre happened almost thwarting my plans to enter a brilliantly lit life in the company of books that I loved the most. In life, we never know what enemies lurk just round the bend of that corner ahead. 

It was a drowsy Wednesday afternoon, when the entire locality was slumbering. I was lost in some new theory in Economics and was trying to memorise it bit by bit mulling over clever mnemonics which were my secret allies in the past. The fields and the hills beyond played with light and shadow and the wind brought in the exhilarating fragrance of wide open countryside. 

A deep, reverberating groan jolted me out of my euphoria.  With every moment it deepened in intensity turning to a sonorous, pounding noise. My first impulse was to get out of the house. As I ran down the stairs the booming noise reduced in intensity making way for an alarming sizzling and lapping emerging from the backyard. In the work area I had to kick away Kurinji, the cat which stood in stiff combat mode with its body arched and its teeth exposed in an angry snarl bang on the doorway. 

Circumventing the washing stone and sidestepping the wet clothes hanging on the clothes line I chased the sound to its origin. The noise was coming from the well, of all the places. From the cement platform I leaned over the circular granite wall around the well and peeped in suspiciously. The water was sloshing about violently, tossing about dazed tilapia fishes and an odd vessel or two which might have fallen in long ago. It held an eerie appeal in its turbulent depths. The water level was also creeping up the slimy stone wall, the small peepal plant slanting in from the fourth ring from the top already drowned. Within no time the water reached up to just a couple of rings away from where I was standing, splashing agitated droplets onto my face. 

‚ÄoeWhat happened, what was that?  The noise came from here, Krishnaa1‚Ä¶. Krishna, Krishnaa‚Ä¶,‚Äù  The loud, melodramatic exclamation was from Naniyamma. The old woman who was ambling on her way to her daily sojourn with her friends in the shed outside Prathiba Industries had taken a detour. Ignoring her, I ran to the road to call Pachan or someone from the grocery store where many of the locals lounged during the afternoon hours. As I reached the hibiscus bushes studded with dazzling red blooms I heard the groan again, but this time followed by a thundering explosion. 

By the time I dashed back from the gate, a bewildered neighbourhood at my wake, a part of the platform around the well had already caved in, a green plastic bucket standing half buried in the debris. 

Every noise, every sight of that afternoon is imprinted in my memory with fearful clarity. People burst in through the gate and streamed in one and two at a time. In came Raghavettan and Chandrikechi through the open gate in the backyard. Then many others from the neighboring houses who had heard the strange, unnatural noises trickled in slowly, irresolute and quite unable to comprehend what would disturb their siesta in such a peaceful July afternoon when the marauding children were in their schools. 

‚ÄoeWhat happened?‚Äù It was Pachan talking in his squeaky voice. 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know,‚Äù I managed to mumble my quivery fingers pointing at the well. 

‚ÄoeAyyo2, Ayyo‚Ä¶the well is going to cave in,‚Äù yelled Ramani, the tailor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife. 

‚ÄoeI read in the newspaper that a well had imploded in Varkala,‚Äù piped in Leroy, who was always in the local library reading up anything printed hoping to qualify in the next public service examination for prospective government employees. 

‚ÄoeRadha, the bucket‚Ä¶ the bucket,‚Äù intoned Naniyamma, in her tremulous voice. 

‚ÄoeLeave the bucket, move away, come away, come away ‚Ä¶‚Äù screeched a woman frantically. Leroy who was treading treacherously close to the well capturing the excitement in his mobile phone camera was hauled back unceremoniously by a concerned elder. 

‚ÄoeEnte badariengale3‚Ä¶e‚Ä¶e‚Ä¶e,‚Äù screamed Pathumma above the din. Then a shiver crept up from the earth drowning the afternoon in dumb, deferential silence and awe. Crash, boom and whoosh‚Ä¶ the well disappeared in a tumult of rubble and water , stunning all. All my attempts to reclaim my life as an individual lay buried in the soggy cavern putting me firmly back from the role of aspiring, sparkling  scholar to that of a docile, glorified, wifely and motherly  shadow in the house  sans an identity. Life which had acquired a new sheen turned dull and then became a repulsive grey after this unexpected turn. Exhaustion from playing host round the clock to curious relatives and friends and fear of the unknown haunted me. People advised us to sell off the property and shift to another locality in the city. Clinging on desperately to my escape route, I did not leave my books and studies. I pored over my books till late at night and rose very early in the morning to do what I could before my day began.  Not one of my dear ones took any notice of what I was doing or why I had started looking so wan and pale. As the day of the entrance test drew nearer I grew more and more excited. Sometimes I wondered whether Unniyettan remembered the exam at all. So one night when I found him up and working on his laptop when I went to sleep I tried to start a conversation. 

‚ÄoeUnniyetta, my exam is next Tuesday.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeExam, what exam?‚Äù He asked absentmindedly. 

‚ÄoeThe PhD entrance exam. You know that I had registered last month for that.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeOh, that one. I had completely forgotten. Hmm‚Ä¶ do you need to take it now? Why not try next year, though it might be difficult after so many years. But try anyways.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBut I am giving it next week,‚Äù I said in a tone that sounded petulant to my own ears. 

‚ÄoeOK, Whatever. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to understand. It is a difficult time‚Ä¶ with the well and all‚Ä¶‚Äù 

But it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the same for everyone, why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I do anything when all of you have your own life? I wanted to yell, but I lay down mutely on my corner of the bed and awaited the loveless nightly routine, committed to my decision to make a change in my life. 

Luckily for me not many visitors came to ogle at the nonexistent well in the days preceding the exam. I worked hard, immersed in my books and journals and even managed to browse the net by hacking the password set by my daughters in the old, disused desktop in the upstairs hall.  When I had asked Samhita for the password she had admonished me. 

‚ÄoeAmma, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t meddle with it, I have stored important data in it.‚Äù 

But I could easily guess the passwords she would set. The important photographs turned out to be some picnic photos with her 8th standard class. 

My sari was laid out the previous day evening and I had arranged my own transport with Raman, the taxi driver whom I called occasionally for shopping trips. 

The beautiful December morning was bright, crisp and clear and brought with it excitement as I had never known before. I was up much earlier than usual, finished my chores and waited impatiently for everyone to leave so that I could start by 9 O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> clock to the examination centre, a college in the outskirts of the city. 

Early morning cooking; the usual anguished inquiries about things nestling in their designated places; rude comments about my inability as a wife and a mother from all quarters; the day was progressing as usual. Though the exhaustion and the subtle verbal abuse remained the same, I was nonchalant. 

At last the girls left at 8.20 glaring at their inefficient mother for not packing the lunch to their satisfaction. The soft rotis smeared with ghee and their favourite vegetable korma lay abandoned on the table in colourful Tupperware boxes that smirked at me. Trying to swallow the lump in my throat, I called after them to inform them that I would go for the exam. Karishma giggled and whispered something to Samhita before disappearing beyond the bend on the road. They did not bother to wish me luck or even find out where the centre was. 

Then it was Unniyettan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s turn. After the usual ruckus of  complaints and admonitions he stepped out. 

‚ÄoeI will go with Raman,‚Äù I said softly, as I did not want to provoke him further. 

‚ÄoeWhat, Oh! My, I forgot completely. Yesterday Narayani Veliyamma had called. She will come by eleven. Go to the railway station and pick her up,‚Äù he was already inside the car. ‚ÄoeBut I am going for the exam,‚Äù I said, confused. ‚ÄoeCan I send Ramani? She wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind. I will be back by one,‚Äù I said in the most confident tone I could manage. 

Narayani Amma was a pesky relative who stayed for weeks on end when she came and joined Unniyettan in his mission to refine me into a perfect housewife. 

‚ÄoeOh, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry about the exam. You can appear for it next year too,‚Äù I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think he was even looking at me when he said this. 

Thrissur is just a stone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s throw away, can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she come another day? I wanted to bellow. Instead I stayed mute and looked at my tormentor pathetically in the hope of buying some sympathy. 

‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t leave the poor dear in the care of strangers. She was all that I had when I was young,‚Äù the gleaming door banged shut with finality and the royal blue car rolled away majestically. 

That was news to me. Usually he did not show any sympathy towards her sneaky, unctuous ways and resented the money he had to part with each time she left after a visit. By the time I recovered enough to call him back the car was already quite far, a shrinking dot on the long empty village road. When I tried his cell phone it was switched off, which in itself was very odd. Though he rarely picked up my calls his phone always used to ring in the past. 

When I turned back a strong gust of wind blew in through the windows facing the open country at the rear. With the wind came a wave of revulsion that engulfed me almost pushing me out to the veranda again. The beautifully decked up, classy house was just a glorified prison for me. I went up listlessly, took the sea green silk sari, kept it back, sat in front of the mirror and braided my hair, fixed the large red bindi and came back again to the sari undecided.  After checking whether the hall ticket was safe in the handbag the umpteenth time I set out to the neighbour‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house to arrange for Ramani to pick up Narayani Amma. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when years of subjugation coiled around my heels like a thick iron chain stopping me dead on the tracks. I cursed everyone, I cried in agony, but at last by 10. 30 I was on my way to the railway station.  Wiping my tears off I pasted a fake smile on my face to welcome her. 

Next time, I tried to console myself when I stacked the books back into their earlier abode. With my heart weighing down like stone, I went back to work and my routine with the additional burden of my visitors‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> exaggerated tales of doom. Seemingly, many houses in her locality caved in soon after the wells had imploded. 

‚ÄoeI won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stay for long, I am scared, Narayanaya namo4..Narayanaya namo‚Ä¶‚Äù She chanted. 

It was in the evening when she was on her third cup of tea that she told me that she was surprised when she received the call from Unniyettan asking her to visit on Tuesday if she wanted to see the well. She whined about the pilgrimage from the local temple she had missed. Unni had told me not to worry and promised to pay for the next pilgrimage, she added.  Even in my distress and shock, I chuckled as I could see though the ploy to fleece money out of Unniyettan. I was sure that there was no pilgrimage and she had jumped at the invitation without any hesitation. 

But whatever was left of my flimsy, make believe world collapsed that moment. 

It was around 8 in the evening and I was in the kitchen. Narayani Amma was lounging in the drawing room watching her daily soap and Unniyettan and the girls were having their dinner in the dining room. As I was entering with a dish I overheard Samhita asking her father what he thought of her idea. 

‚ÄoeYou are my daughter,‚Äù said my husband of 16 years, ‚Äoegood that it fizzled out. Otherwise it would have grown into a big problem.‚Äù the camaraderie was evident. 

I froze behind the curtain. My ears burnt with shame. Though I knew that they did not particularly want  me to go back to studies, I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have imagined in my wildest dreams that  they could be so devious. 

The decision to escape was made in that split second. 

The next day Narayani Amma left by the 10 30 local train pleased with the generosity of Unnimon5, who had always been ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>like her own son‚Äù. 

I burnt with the desire to escape, but just walking out would not have helped me. I had put in all that I had got from my mother in building the house and buying the property and both were registered in my husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name. What I had was some gold, the money which had been given to me for monthly expenses and a broken spirit incapable of taking charge. 

I really wanted to escape, but was scared of only one person- the weak, docile Radha, mother to two daughters and wife to a callous man. 

As time passed the house stifled me, forcing me to escape into the breezy, verdant environs outside.  That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when I caught a glimpse of the rarely cleared  rocky  corner of the compound which lay  far away  from the house. Unniyettan had kept the area practically untouched as he had realized the archaeological significance of the place. He did not want any worker to get curious about the rocky dolmen with a crevice at the top left corner. The Muniyara as it was called by the archaeologists was discovered by Unniyettan himself soon after we bought the property from a farmer in the countryside who owned acres and acres of land. In my desperation to escape, a bizarre idea took shape in my mind. I could hide in the Muniyara till I was able to take a decision. As the day progressed I was in frenzy. Get out, get out chanted something inside me obstinately. 

I wandered like a ghost inside and outside taking in every inch of the house, trying to recall a good memory associated with the place that would give me the courage to stay. But every corner of the house told me the story of an ill-fated, suppressed woman, stuck in a mansion.  It was exactly half an hour before the girls‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> return that I ran to the clearing in the middle of the bushes wildly like a mad woman. I climbed up the rock above the dolmen and wormed into the burial chamber through its narrow entrance at the top. 

That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s my story. 

It is quite dark now inside the dolmen, but I am not scared. My heart has stopped fluttering like a bird‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. All I want to do is to have a peaceful night‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sleep without the burden of the heavy stone in my chest that has always weighed me down. Sleep‚Ä¶sleep‚Ä¶sleep; sleep will lick away the wounds in my soul caused by years of repression and humiliation. I lie suspended between sleep and wakefulness and before I know, I am on the third day in the in the dark belly of the burial chamber. I am famished and quite weak. But I feel much stronger, almost like a human being. The decision is made.  Now, it is time to get out and walk towards a new life. Let me see whether I can   crawl out and sneak away without attracting anyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attention. 

Getting out is not easy. However much I try, I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t reach the mouth of the dolmen. I struggle to roll the Nannangadi towards the crevice and invert it letting the bones tumble out without any fear. I am out. 

Creeping towards the house now‚Ä¶  My heart is pounding faster and faster as I  stop right under the window of my daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bedroom. 

‚ÄoeStupid lady , she should have thought of us before going away,‚Äù it was Samhita  talking to her sister. 

‚ÄoeBut do you think someone did something to her? All her jewellery is also missing.‚Äù That is  Karishma. 

‚ÄoeBah, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think so. I feel that she would have eloped with someone.‚Äù How could she be so insensitive? 

‚ÄoeI am not so sure,‚Äù Karishma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s  giggle shatters like glass splinters. 

I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe my ears. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to stay any longer. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t feel anything now, not even resentment or anger. 

How might Unniyettan have reacted to my disappearance? I am very curious to know. May be I will never meet him in this life once I go away. I am sure that at least he will be affected, if not my selfish daughters. 

I think I can hear him talking. Oh, he is on the terrace, on his phone. He might be talking to somebody about me, I think.  Let me hide behind the Asoka tree so that he wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see me even if he comes to the edge of the terrace. 

The night is very still. Not a leaf is fluttering as the wind has died down completely. The air is suffused with the fragrance of   tuberoses. 

‚ÄoeOh, you kept me waiting for so long, Miranda.‚Äù 

Why is he talking his colleague so late into night? 

‚ÄoeHa‚Ä¶ha‚Ä¶ha‚Ä¶ I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what to say‚Ä¶ come somehow‚Äù   I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember the last time I have heard him laughing so mirthfully. 

‚ÄoeMy wife, oh, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry about her. She has gone to her aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s place.‚Äù 

What?  In the grey nightlight I can see him clearly now. 

‚ÄoeO.K. meet you at 12 noon tomorrow at the airport. Will take you to the guest house right away. Bye.‚Äù 

Leaning on to the half wall, a  lewd smile lighting up his face, he is a total stranger to me. Just a repulsive, pot bellied, bald middle aged man. Why haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I seen him so far? Why didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I escape from him earlier? I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know. But I feel light like a feather, completely free of the chain that has been stifling me. 

There is nothing to be worried about now.  There is no one to slink away from. 

Unniyettan opens the door at the fourth shrill ring of the calling bell. The girls are standing outside their bedroom. Their anxious faces register shock and disbelief. Holding up my head high, with a little limp I go into the guest bedroom and bang the door shut. 

Tomorrow... Tomorrow I will meet a lawyer and settle down matters.
