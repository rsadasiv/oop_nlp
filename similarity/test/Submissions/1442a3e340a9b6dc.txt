*Family Matters * 

*By Jyotsna Jha* 

It is almost five when I reach my mother's house in Noida, in Sector Four. It is already dark, and the last remains of this cold December day will soon merge with the bleak street lights on the road. Her house is only a thirty-minute-drive from my office but it took me more than an hour to navigate though the crawling traffic. It is Friday and the roads are full of people escaping from their offices, taking off to the several townships dotting Delhi's suburbs for the weekend. 

Our house is one of the oldest in the neighbourhood; its weathered grey stands out amidst the hard, white gleam of the new apartments springing up around it. It also has other claims to quaintness. It is the only bungalow in the neighbourhood, with a large lawn--although in shambles---and circular balconies with cast-iron railing overlooking it, something I don't see in modern houses any more.  Our house was built way back in the seventies when Noida was hardly the pulsating satellite city it is today. It was one of the first houses to be built here and I remember not having too many friends and neighbours around us. I have faint memories of me and Millie, my younger sister, playing, running around inside the vacant plots around our house. It seemed like a very exciting thing then, to trespass the boundaries set up by our non-existent neighbours.  There are times when I feel the house is a lonely, alien thing, caught in a time warp, like an old man caught accidently between a crowd of boisterous teenagers, not knowing what to do with himself. But every time I am around this familiar bend of road I realize how much I love this old house. It seems to be my lone connection to a past which is fast closing itself on me. 

The door is unlocked. She is expecting me. 

"Mama, I warned you about this the last time too. This can be dangerous. Every day the newspaper is full of some terrible news about attacks on old people living alone," my high voice fills the drawing room, as I stride in. 

Last Friday I had walked into an unlocked house to find her sleeping on her bed. 

I am surprised to find her sitting on the old divan in the living room.  She seldom comes to this part of the house. 

"You are late. I've been sitting here waiting for more than an hour," her voice is soft but I can sense her annoyance anyway. 

I keep the carton and plastic bags I am carrying carefully on the cabinet mindful of the tray of eggs inside it. 

"Bad traffic" I mumble back, as I settle myself on the settee next to her, knowing well that she has not heard me. 

She looks at me crinkling her eyes in a look of concentration. 

"How have you been?" 

"Okay." She replies. 

"Savita's been coming regularly? Her maid Savita has been looking after her and the house since the last ten years. 

"Yes." 

"Did the supplies last you out?" 

"What?" 

"Has the stuff I got you last week lasted you out?" my voice rises, perhaps to a pitch higher than what is necessary. 

I see her shrinking back into the divan. 

"Yes. In fact there is still some left," she replies after some effort at recollection. 

"I'm just so very tired. I've had a very hectic week in office," my voice is milder. 

She doesn't seem to be in a mood for a conversation and is now looking fixedly at the pictures on the opposite wall.  It is a picture of my father and mother on their twenty-fifth anniversary. My mother still looked beautiful then, slim in a black and gold saree, with laughter and love in her eyes.  I remember the day well. The house heaving with visitors. The flowers and the cards. My father's eyes following my mother everywhere. Only a woman as beautiful as her can be loved the way she was. 

Beside it, is a family picture taken when I was six. Millie was three, as cute as a button, smiling gaily in my mother's arms. I recall what I have heard many a times about her--that she has the spark of life in her. They said the same thing about my mother.  I am standing beside my father, with a faraway expression in my eyes. Comparisons came up thick and fast whenever our relatives or friends visited us--my resemblance to our big-boned, swarthy father and Millie's to mother. 

For a while we are silent. I think about the things I can ask her to take the conversation forward. 

It has been a long since we sat together in the living room. I find her in her bedroom or sitting in the balcony most of the times when I come to meet her. She likes observing the loitering humanity walking by. The mundane drama of life playing itself out. The other four bedrooms in the house have a lock on them now. 

I realize our living room has looked like this for a long time. Actually, it has not changed a bit since my father died six years ago. The furniture is arranged in the same way. The paper roses in the large, white vase in the corner have lost their colour. A film of dust has settled everywhere, on the table tops, the silver, and the figurines my parents had collected with great care over the years. A suffocating, mouldy smell rises from the old Persian carpet and the faded sofa upholstery. 

I watch my mother.  She looks older than her sixty-eight years. Her head is completely grey; and her face is wan, with a grey pallor. The criss-cross of blue veins running all over her forehead looks more pronounced each time I see her. Large masses of fat have settled around her once slender form in ugly rolls. It has grown on her waist in generous pendent excess, and it hangs on her arms in loose, wobbly folds. But it has not touched her face, which despite its many lines and furrows, has not lost its definition.  I wish I could say the same for her. 

"How are the children?" 

"They are fine. Natasha won the second prize in the school elocution, and Abhishek has recently joined guitar classes." 

My son Abhishek is her favourite grandchild. We have only recently discovered his autism, after being conclusively informed by the doctor that his contrariness could not be passed off as the eccentricities of the prodigiously gifted, as we had hoped. Ma insists his autism has got nothing to do with her affections. Though I suspect that in some way, she had always known about Abhishek. 

"It has been quite some time since I saw them." I try to sense a hint of an accusation in her voice. 

"They wanted to come to look you up but they've been busy with something or the other." 

She sighs resignedly. 

I am lying. Natasha has refused to visit their grandma for the last two occasions I proposed it. There are things about my mother she does not understand, stuff that I find difficult to explain to her, like the smell of stale urine which clings to her in the mornings; her habit of narrating the same incidents again and again, and her incessant comments about how things were during 'her times', and how they ought to be now. 

Or maybe I was not insistent enough. 

"Why don't you come home for a few days Mama? Stay with us, for a few days at least."  She has not moved out of this house since her heart surgery two years back. 

She shakes her head. "What is the point Misha? You will be away at work the entire day, and the kids are too grown up to enjoy the company of someone as old as me. I am better off here in my home, between these few rooms in the house, happy with my routine and familiar surroundings. Without the unnecessary flutter." 

Once again I am struck by how her definition of happiness keeps dwindling itself -- to mere dependence on familiarity for comfort. How adherence to set patterns might give solace, like the same story a child begs to hear again and again. At one time I respected the order of nature but now it is difficult to believe everything happens for a reason. Or maybe, as the years pass, age can turn into a collaborator, turning us into somebody we do not know yet. Not happy, not sad, but content, on the islands of our own making. 

"Millie called up on Monday. We spoke for long." Why do I get the feeling that there is something layered in her voice, something hidden? 

"How is she?" It's been long since I have spoken to my sister. 

"She is fine. She will be going on a vacation to the Europe next month." For the first time in the day, I see a smile on her face.  But the mention of Millie never fails to bring a smile to her face. 

I feel a sneeze coming and I am suddenly a little breathless. 

"This room stinks. It's making me wheezy!" I announce. "Why don't you open these windows once in a while?" 

I get up to open all the windows one by one. I have requested Savita to do this every morning but all my pleas and occasional bursts of annoyance fall on deaf years. 

"The air is cold. It will make me sick Mishu," she protests feebly. 

"This foul air will make you sicker!" 

"You know that I've just recovered from a bad ..." 

"Just listen to yourself! You are turning into a hypochondriac," I clip her reply. 

She watches me silently for a while and then gets up and leaves for her bedroom. From the way she drags her feet I know that her joints are troubling her again. I am not doing justice to my intentions, I realize.  I never do it most of the times. I know that that when I will be out of her tremulous world of bad news, of aches and pains, of her physical and emotional incontinences, I will be thinking about her. While lying on my bed enjoying a movie on TV with my husband or preparing a 'Sunday Special' dinner for my kids I am going to think about today. About the words I said to her, how I said them, and what I did, and mostly, what I could have done. 

I pick up the tins and jars I have bought for her and arrange them on her kitchen shelves. I put the fruits in the refrigerator.  The refrigerator is stuffed.  The eggs I brought last week are still lined in the tray. The diabetic fruit crush is untouched.  The glass shelves are crammed with bowls full of leftovers. Last week Savita had complained about her eating only biscuits and canned soup in front of the TV. 

I go about sorting the stuff, trying to figure out what can be preserved and what needs to be chucked into the dustbin.  When I am done with it, I decide to do something about the drawing room. After an hour of wiping and vacuum cleaning I enter her bedroom. She is watching the television. It is a programme on the National Geographic about the liger, a cross breed between a tiger and a lion.  Since when did she develop an interest in the animal world? I switch channels, tuning in to an old Bollywood movie. She should like it. 

"I think you'll enjoy this Mama. It is a Raj Kapoor movie." I try to sound cheerful. 

She doesn't reply. Maybe she has not heard me in the din of the song playing on TV. 

My cell phone rings. It is my husband. He has invited the Maliks home. "I've ordered food from Magnolia's," he assures me before I break into a panic.  It is seven pm. I should be back home by eight. I am looking forward to the evening. 

I am also suddenly very tired. And also very hungry.  I sit on Mama's rocking chair for a while and close my eyes.  For a while my life is illuminated by simple, mundane pleasures -- a nice dinner, children waiting for my return, an evening of jollity with friends. 

I get down to sorting out her medicines. Taking out individual pills and putting them into glass vials which have different timings mentioned on them-- 8 am after breakfast, 2 pm after lunch and 9 pm after dinner.  The vial with 9 pm written on it has 3 pills inside it. That means she has been missing her evening medicines. That explained her recent report with precariously raised levels of blood sugar. 

"Mama, you have been missing on your pills," I call out to her. 

She doesn't reply. I look up to find her drifting between sleep and wakefulness, her head drooping and then suddenly rising with a start. I decide against insisting on dinner. She looks tired and I'm getting late anyway.  I think I am through with my visit. 

"I'm leaving. I'll lock the door from outside. Savita has the key." 

She nods her head and looks at me with sleepy eyes. 

I am about to leave the room but something is nagging me at the back of my mind. The hot water bag.  It will help her aching joints. 

I don't find it hanging in the bathroom so I get back into her room to look for it. Inside her wardrobe, and then her cupboard. I don't find it there either.  What I find in the bottom shelf is a large box, packed in a shiny pink wrapping paper which has been opened. It is a box of fine, Swiss chocolates. Each individual piece nestles in its cup, wrapped in gold foil. The flavours of temptation are numerous: Mint at the heart, Almond toast, Hazelnut delight, Coconut magic. Most of its luscious contents have already been consumed. She could not have bought this. I search for the name of the generous giver of this thoughtlessly dispensed gift. 'Happy birthday Ma, Luv Millie' says the card pasted on the top. 

I missed it. Ma's birthday, on the 22nd, last Monday. 

I just sit there, holding the box in my hands. I don't know how many minutes have passed by. My mother's lone smile of the day flashes before my eyes and an old feeling makes its way inside me. A familiar haunting.   I think about Millie. Away in Mumbai since the last fifteen years. Millie in her plush upscale apartment in Worli, living the perfect life, with her perfect children. Away from middle-class struggles of managing home and work, insulated from this hopelessness tied to insulin jabs, a fading memory, and the loneliness inside our mother's increasingly silent world. Her compensations for all of this are long, phone conversations, and dainty triflings wrapped in diaphanous paper. 

My anger cracks.  It gathers, building into a senseless wave of urgency, and then it soars above me, a terrible, animal thing, now beyond my grasp. 

I am beside her in a second, shaking her shoulders. "So this is what made your sugar levels rise so dangerously." 

She only blinks at me foolishly as I hurl my words recklessly at her. 

"Here I am, taking time off from office, visiting you every week, depriving my children of my time, worrying myself sick over your health and you ... you have been munching on this poison all these days." 

Her face twists and turns. 

"You have been sulking because I forgot your birthday!" 

"No, that's not right," she protests. 

"And in the meanwhile, your dearest child has sent you this ... this gift, this thoughtless, terrible thing." 

I want to ask her, 'Don't you know how much I care for you?' 

But instead I shout, "Why the hell am I here, cleaning and mopping, and moping about you!" 

"You really don't need to do any of this for me Misha. I ... I can manage by myself. I have never told you to do any of these things for me." 

"Manage by yourself? Like how? Like this?"  I wave the box violently in front of her face. 

I stand there watching her as she slips into utter abjection. 

She turns away from me, averting not just her face but also her body.  Her shaking hands cover her face. By now I begin to realize that I am getting carried away. 

I sit in front of her trying to free her hands from her face. She resists, pushing me away with whatever strength she has. Her expression hits me like a physical blow. Her red face is swollen with the weight of looming tears. Her lips spread wide, slightly overturned like a small, crying child. She looks at once, both piteous and ridiculous. She suddenly reminds of Abhishek when he recently came home crying from a football match, bullied and beaten by the older boys. Then, between the hiccups, the words come out, like they have been wrenched out from some place deep inside her. 

"I've wanted to tell you this all evening. Millie wants me to move in with her ... for...forever.  I tried to her talk her out of this, but she is adamant. She always felt terrible about you shouldering all the responsibilities... though... I've never told you all this."  I can feel my joints loosen and my bones suddenly soften, unwilling to hold my weight. I am almost a heap on the floor beside her. 

"She wants you to keep this house. She said she doesn't want her share. She will be talking to you soon about all of this."
