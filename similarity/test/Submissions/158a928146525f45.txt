*Leave, gentle spirit* 

*Neera Kashyap* 

In this village-town in the middle region of the Himalayas, stillness usually stole upon me in the pitch blackness of night. Once I had shuttered in my single wooden window and switched off the two naked bulbs that dangled from the ceiling beam, my women neighbors said I would be safe from "ghosts, thieves and bad men". Cut off from all sources of light, I couldn't see my own hands in the dark. But the soft cotton quilt was comforting. So was the rough shawl I wrapped around my head against the wind that whistled in through the crevices in the wooden rafters and stone walls. At this hour, I would try to shed my ethnographer's cap, not think of the myriad jottings of the day in my steno pads, nor their detailed interpretations in the red bound spiral notebooks stacked in a carved wooden niche in the wall. The wind was often restless, like a ghost creeping in with creaks and rustles. The cicadas thrummed more musically, their sound broken occasionally by the sharp yelps of a barking deer. Then stillness and a deep restful sleep. 

It rained heavily in the morning but cleared quickly. The clouds nestled low in the blue hill ranges, reflecting the pink of an evening sky streaked with rose. It was Neema's song that carried from the fields below. It was early autumn and the time of paddy harvest. I had not heard her sing before, though her family and I lived on the ground floor of the same two-storied house in a couple of rented rooms each, identical and a wall apart. A thin muscular woman, she ate little, worked without cease, her pale face creased as much by the weather as by her smiles. Her husband was in the army and posted in distant Darjeeling, turning up once or twice a year for a fortnight. Neema alone took care of her three children, her buffalo and two cows and a few scattered fields in the terraced valley below. It was Neema's song in the Kumaoni language, so plaintively rising into the sunset that had struck me into an unaccustomed stillness. I reached for my steno pad to jot down the words that I still could not fathom, though I knew Hindi well, thanks to years of study and conversation at home in the US. "Ghughutee na basa...aam-ey ki dai ma...ghughutee na basa." 

Neema walked up the hill track, breathing hard beneath a huge headload of pine needles gathered for the cattle as bedding for winter. She was followed by her older teenaged daughter, Panna, who walked up jauntily with a similar headload, pine needles sticking to her red cheeks which she blew out in dramatic distress. 

"Writing, always writing," Neema said to me with a laugh as mother and daughter stepped into our shared verandah after dumping their burden in the cattle shed. "Now don't sit alone in the dark like this. Come eat with us. I have brought spinach and there are fenugreek leaves somewhere. I will make *Kafuli* and we will eat it with hot rice. Not spicy, okay? Better than your rotis You still can't make them. How will they fluff up on the fire if they are not round and even!" 

"No, no..Neema," I protested, knowing full well how helpless would be my protests. 

"What no, no? Always no! Say yes, yes also...yes, yes." 

Like many ethnographers, I had learnt to live like the women I researched, becoming a part of their lives and their seasons. A year and a half and I could walk long distances like them, use the sickle, and carry headloads of grass like the younger girls, even a bucket of water on my head without getting splashed. I learnt to dress like them, to cook the way they did and to joke in between chores. Early on, I felt it was my white skin that kept me from belonging, and then I saw it was my earnestness. I had been ready to leave in three months but not after I learnt to relax. My life in the US felt more like a chimera than this one did. And this despite the fact that there was no heating, no running water, no TV, no reliable electricity, no entertainment and food utterly different from what I was used to. 

Just as I would observe and record my target group - women - I had to submit to being observed and recorded as well. It was on our landlady Mansa Devi's verandah on the floor above us that most of the laughter resonated. Sometimes, I was made to sit on a low stool so my hair could be massaged with mustard oil as it was pronounced "too dry". There was genuine astonishment that I wore no gold. One evening, some of the women draped their own ornaments on me - necklaces of varying length, dangling earrings, bracelets, armlets, toe-rings, revealing my "beauty" to me in a cracked discolored mirror. 

Mansa Devi was struck by a thunderous thought. "But why are you not married still? Is there no one to arrange a match for you?" she asked. 

"Maybe she is not marriageable,‚Äù suggested young Panna slyly. Neema flew at her for her rudeness and made to calm my 'ruffled feathers', but Mansa Devi came up with a solution: "Maybe we should find you a match. Not like us. Someone like you who is always writing, writing ,writing‚Ä¶. also who can talk like you ..chut phut chut phut in English...there are men like that in our bigger towns.... we will see.." 

Mansa Devi's married daughter Shobha piped up, "But Ellen *didi* sleeps alone. She likes to sleep alone. How can anyone sleep alone? We all sleep together!" 

No sooner was this said that an apparition burst out from behind a *sari *hanging on a clothesline in the corner of the room. It was Champa, Neema's younger teenaged daughter dressed in a *kameez* that was too short and a *salwar* that rode up way too high, showing a lot of ankle and calf. Her hair was clipped atop her head in an untidy spout. She shouldered a cloth bag that bulged with my red spiral notebooks. It was when she began loping across the porch in long earnest strides, loudly slapping her rubber slippers to her soles that there was a burst of laughter. Neema lunged to smack her behind, but fell over laughing. 

"This song in Kumaoni - Ghughutee na basa - what does it mean, Panna?" It was just after dawn. I had brought my laundry down to the covered spring used by several households who lived on the steep terraced slopes above the valley. The water was icy and my fingers thrummed with a cold that felt like heat. 

"*Didi*, your fingers are so pink and pretty," said Panna, breaking her rhythm of slapping a pink garment against the smooth rocky ledge on which we squatted. She stared woefully at her own, shivered, her breath vapory. 

"Its a *nyoli* - a forest song. A sad song, like when you miss somebody, no? *Ghughutee* is a sort of bird. She sits on the branch of a mango tree. The singer feels sad when the *ghughutee* sings because the singing reminds her of her husband who is in the army and posted far away in snowy Ladakh. There is war and she worries. It is the season of *chait* - you know *chait*? Spring! She misses him more because it is spring and everything looks beautiful. She wishes she had the *ghughutee's* wings to fly to her husband to look at his face to her heart's content. She knows she can't .....so she tells the *ghughutee *to do her a favor....to fly to her husband and tell him all that she feels for him." 

There were few men in the households, I had noted. Due to fragmented landholdings and low agricultural yields, most had to find jobs in medium or large towns and cities. The women worked unceasingly from morning till night, taking care of their households of the young and elderly, their cattle and fields. It was worst for young brides whose husbands left them soon after they married, to face households of unknown hostile elders. They missed their parents, their brothers and sisters, their girlfriends, their villages, even hazy notions of their husbands. So they sang their woes to the *ghughutees*, to the wind and streams, to the clouds and trees .......to anything that listened to their sorrows so they could carry on ........caring but uncared for, tending but untended. The winds and trees heard and called back. A restless spirit ran through everything - caressing, consoling, disturbing. 

A chill ran down my spine as Panna's wet hands gripped my arms, "*Didi, didi*....tomorrow is the day when we attend the *jagar*[1] <#m_5942286588001537720__ftn1>. You know....the last day when unmarried women are allowed to attend. You are not in your m.c. (menstrual cycle) now, *didi*, no? Then you can't go...it will pollute everything they say." 

It must have been my earnest look for I had to pacify Panna. "No Panna, I am not in my m.c. I can go...yes, yes......yes." 

The night had been a disturbed one. Mansa Devi's husband had come home on one of his fortnightly trips from his job in the forest service in another hill district. He had been drinking and the sounds from the floor above had been angry - suppressed shouts, a bed being moved, heavy footfalls‚Ä¶.a scream. By the time I had had a bath just after dawn, I found that only Panna and Champa had waited for me. The older women had already left for the *jagar*. 

The story relating to the *jagar *had already done the rounds. In Mansa Devi's natal village in the valley below, an eighteen year old girl, Phula had been possessed by the spirit of an old woman relative who had died even before this girl was born. It had been two months and the girl had behaved increasingly crazy. While working in the fields, she would take off into the forest to disappear for hours together, only to return home looking wild and with no memory of the events of the day. She suffered eating disorders and frequently felt that an old woman was reaching for her from somewhere high above. When she had begun to babble incoherently, her mother forced her to recount the facts. 

The girl said it was an old woman who had been related to their family through marriage who possessed her. She had had two daughters and no son. The daughters had married and moved away. The old woman had died a widow and alone so had been unhappy at death. By the time one of her daughters could reach the village, the ghost woman's house and land had been appropriated by her husband's male relatives - Phula's ancestral family. The ghost wanted justice for her daughters who were still alive. Till then, she would stay in possession of Phula's body and mind. 

From the field above Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family home, we could hear the chanting and drumming. The house was a traditional one made of stone with mud walls and a slate roof. The threshold had old wooden carvings of flowers on either side of the elephant god *Ganesha* who raised his trunk in greeting. A collared dove peeped its head out of a wooden nestle, tilted its head to listen. 

The house inside was dense with people. Smoke rose in thick grey spirals from coal embers. Phula sat in the middle of the room across from the *jagariya*[2] <#m_5942286588001537720__ftn2>. Between them to one side was a framed photo of the Goddess Kali ‚Ä" blue body, several arms, a garland of skulls and a red tongue sticking out to heighten her fierce expression. Incense smoke rose up to her face amid other offerings of red hibiscus, raw rice and lentils, lemon and sweets. 

Phula was dressed in a grey *salwar kameez*, her hair loosely bound with a red band. She sat passive, a long vermilion smear marking her forehead. Her stare was directed at a red thread tied to her wrist. A group of men sat around her ‚Ä" possibly close relatives. The rest of the room was filled with women and children and a few men. I saw Mansa Devi in the background, eyes closed, and lips murmuring the chant under her breath. Though the windows were open, the smoke stayed in the room, heavy and acrid. 

The *jagariya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s *chanting of *mantras *was steady, almost static, as he concentrated on sweeping the girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s body from head to toe with bird feathers bound together with stalks of stinging nettles. With each sweep, he would shake the feathers out before Goddess Kali. The *jagariya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s* accompanists kept the rhythm of his chant with the beating of a large brass plate and three drums of varying sizes. 

After a while, the *jagariya* looked to the heavens as if in praise. He would break his praise to speak to the goddess in tones that were sometimes humble and importunate, sometimes assertive and commanding. All the while, the girl was swept with the griffin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s feathers ‚Ä" the possessing spirit offered in a ritual of transference to the goddess to control and absorb into her own being. The *jagariya* then stood up to worship in all four directions, performed a ritual prayer, then chanted quite threateningly in Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s direction, as if commanding the ghost to manifest and leave her. 

At this point, some men brought in a goat. It bleated incessantly as it was being pulled, shaking its head to jerk off the pressure. The *jagariya* spoke to the goat threateningly, looked in the direction of the goddess several times as if to warn it of her presence. The tempo became more dynamic as the priest looked in all directions as he chanted, the metal and drum beats now very loud. I noticed the left side of Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face begin to twitch. The twitch trembled and ran down the left side of her body. As her body sprung into life, her head began to move from side to side. The *jagariya *now chanted directly to her as if to fully awaken her ghost spirit. The tempo became more charged. Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s movements changed, head now flung up, then down. Her hair came loose, falling and rising in frenzied sweeps, the feathers sweeping her body in close rhythm. 

In response to a signal from the *jagariya*, a man stood up, possibly her father and crouched to offer Phula a plateful of raw rice. She stared at it, and then raised her right hand to smear a handful of it onto her forehead. She then smeared a handful onto her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s forehead, gripped the back of his neck so she could join foreheads with him. Then rocking back and forth for a few seconds, she suddenly released him and flung her hands up into the air. Then with both hands she scooped up the remaining rice and tossed it on her head and behind her shoulders. This was repeated with every family member in the room who came to appease the ghost with an offering. 

When the women came, they placed new *saris *on Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s head, each of which was removed by the priest. I recognized Phula‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother at once as she came towards her daughter. Her head was covered and her face prematurely lined. The ghost seemed to hold onto her the longest. When she was finally released, she wept so hard she could hardly stand. This sight made all the women sob. Then babies were offered and the ghost held the babies to its chest and then flung them back to be caught. Babies and women sobbed aloud to a thunderous crescendo of drum beats. Finally, Phula flung handfuls of rice around the room. Her face fell passive. The *jagariya* stopped sweeping the girl, offered rice grains to the goddess, placed flowers in the girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hands, smeared her forehead with fresh vermilion and chanted a final *mantra*, declaring all was peaceful. My body felt taut as a bowstring. I had to commit everything to memory as jottings here would have been totally out of place. 

It was dusk by the time we walked back along the ridges of the fields up the slope. I could take in nothing more of that evening. 

‚ÄoeThe ritual will only end tomorrow,‚Äù whispered Neema as if speaking to herself. ‚ÄoeThey will return to the spot where the spirit took hold of the girl. The goat will be sacrificed as an offering to Kali and some village men will feed on it. Women and outsiders will not be allowed. They will make sure the ghost returns to the earth‚Äù. 

I only half listened. I knew the ghost had already left Phula. 

The next morning I kept to my room till I could leave it unobserved. I walked up the hill track which levelled off to run along a mixed forest of pine, oak and rhododendron. A bunch of red-billed magpies alighted noisily on an oak. 

‚ÄoeHoi‚Äù, I heard the hill call in a young female voice‚Ä¶.. 

I turned to see Panna and Neema stand below outside the cattle shed, both waving to me. 

‚ÄoeYou are going to your women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group, no?‚Äù 

I waved and turned to climb again. 

‚ÄoeYou will leave us soon, no?‚Äù Panna shouted again. 

Her voice was pitched high when I turned around fully to look again: ‚ÄoeSoon you will go‚Ä¶to Delhi first, no? Then to your America?‚Äù She made a motion with her hand to chart the course of an airplane winging into the air. I felt glad for the distance. I waved as cheerily as I could and turned firmly around. At the next incline, I turned again. Panna was gone but Neema, now a distant figure, was still looking out for me. 

******* 

It was snowing outside. From the 33rd floor of my apartment, the city appeared like a jungle of lights, buildings as tall as the hills. I felt warm, checked the heating and turned it down. I poured myself a glass of water and dunked in some ice cubes. 

I stared at my desk ‚Ä" a flurry of papers, cloth bound notebooks, jotting pads and stacks of red spiral notebooks. I read and re-read my session with Kamla *Behn*, the founder of the women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s organization that had worked with women in my research field on issues of livelihoods and health rights for decades. At first, I had spent months with her and her staff, trying to understand the issues that affected the women. 

Kamla *Behn* had dismissed ghost-possession as superstition, not to be encouraged. She reeled off statistics on how this increased mortality rates especially in villages, as people simply would not take the sick to scientifically trained doctors or hospitals without the express permission of the family priest. This spirit possession was not confined to mental illness but covered physical illness as well, she had pointed out, her cultured face warm with passion. 

She had studied my face when I fell silent. ‚ÄoeTheirs is a hard life, Ellen‚Ä¶.I know. They are virtually widows. The winters are severe. During rains, there are landslides and they are cut off for weeks. Their homes, their cattle get washed away into rivers. Their land is barely fertile and their crops insufficient to even feed their families and themselves. Their own needs come last‚Ä¶always last. I know they need to hold to some faith, some belief to survive and they hold to their gods and priests tenaciously‚Ä¶..‚Äù 

‚ÄoeIf I was to ask you a personal question, Kamla *Behn*,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄoeDo you believe a ghost can possess a human being and be released through magic rituals?‚Äù 

She sighed. ‚ÄoeDo people believe in ghosts in your country?‚Äù 

I hesitated. ‚ÄoeWell, yes. But like something on the outside‚Ä¶.like something that moves but there is no one moving it.‚Äù 

She said: ‚ÄoeI believe in the faith of these women even when I fight against the irrational. If I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been exposed to the outside world, I may have had the same faith, the same beliefs.‚Äù 

I turned off the lights and fell across my bed in exhaustion. The city lights kept my room dimly lit. I clenched and unclenched my hands to relax them, and then fell into a restless sleep. A voice spoke to me in a dream. It said that since my return, my fitful sleep was due to a spirit that had possessed me. It advised me to sing to the *ghughutee* ‚Ä" to let the *ghughutee* carry my song through my blood like a river that sang as it rose and fell, rose and fell - sang of my restlessness, my loss, my separation, my longing. It may leave me then.
