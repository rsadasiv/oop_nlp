*Once Upon a Time in Hindustan* 

*Lucknow, India ‚Ä" June 24, 2014* 

Sitting on my balcony, gazing out on the paper mill colony slum near *Nishatgunj *bazaar, I kept on lighting one Marlboro after another, thinking about my gorgeous Indo-Persian lover, my *ashiq*, my splendid poet, my stunning storyteller, I was breaking my head about where the hell he was, and ‚Ä" while putting out my cigarette butt in my trendy ashtray and exhaling ‚Ä" I was obsessing about becoming fluent in that mysterious, or should I perhaps say, enchanted language of his. 

As fast as possible, I do have to emphasize. 

I was scared to death that otherwise I would be sucked back into that meaningless existence of mine in West Hollywood with dad Karl and dad Michel, my two fathers. 

At that particular moment, while lighting up and suckling on yet another smoke, I was still unaware about that sickly thing that would happen in less than five minutes. 

All I could think of was my beautiful bard and his language. I was dying to speak his nation-less but courteous form of speech, named not after a country but after a military camp: Urdu. 

With him, of course. 

And‚Ä¶I must embarrassingly confess I was also obsessing about Priyanka Sharma, my roommate. Not only was she absolutely stunning. She also had the habit of running around the house wearing only a t-shirt and white panties which distracted me big time: man, she was hot. 

I was pacing from left to right on my balcony out of stress, holding my phone in my right hand in case Ejaaz Hussain would finally call and my cigarette in my other. Plus I was terrified that Priyanka would come into my room again half-naked. I can still hear my footsteps on the marble floor, thinking about all that now. I can even see my red-polished toe-nails through my mind‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eye. 

I sent Ejaaz Hussain another text, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>where are you?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> for the umpteenth time, adding twenty or so question marks and persistently pressing my finger on the send button, as if that could make it reach faster. 

It was hot as hell, and my pores were bulleting out drops of sweat. Now and then, in between checking my phone and rereading his last messages, I gazed down at the crowds. Supporters were still loudly celebrating the victory of the Hindu Nationalist Party. Exactly one month ago the BJP had won the elections for the first time in the history of modern India. Not that I cared much. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know that the nationalists hated Urdu so much that probably they would be exhilarated to gas its speakers to death in twenty-first century concentration camps. I just wanted to be away from California, see my very own famous Urdu storyteller again, my *dastango*, and have him whisper sweet, poetic words in Urdu in my ear. I saw being fluent in Urdu as a way to stay in South-Asia and do charity work as a doctor; the total opposite of what my fathers did in the USA. 

To calm down, I poured myself a glass of wine, even though it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even four in the afternoon. It was a Shiraz, if I remember right, you know, of the Four Seasons Vineyards in Maharashtra. I gulped it down in one go. Poured another one and gulped it down, swiped through our photos, sucked on my ciggy while admiring Ejaaz Hussain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s satin-like skin, his voluptuous eyelashes, his deep dark-brown eyes, his raven-black hair and felt a few hot tears rolling off my cheeks. We both looked so intense together, as if we were ecstatic or possessed ‚Ä" *majzoob *- by something that was larger than life. What was it? Was it art? A poetic spell perhaps? And what a sharp contrast: my pale, almost paper-white skin against his. 

I inhaled again deeply, kept the smoke in my lungs for a few seconds, exhaled through my nostrils and thought about my marvelous but lost Indian prince: he was my key to learning Urdu and leaving America forever.  He was the key to my new life. 

But-where-the-hell-was-he? 

Back home, for some reason or other I never felt attracted to boys. Girls yes. But boys never. They looked like emotionless robots to me. I tried. So many times. It always turned into a theater of disasters: his became elastic like an overcooked macaroni and mine even dryer as the Sahara Desert. But with Ejaaz Hussain, it was something else: we were like two rutting animals caught in a small cage.  And when he spoke Urdu to me, I just melted in his words. Perhaps I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a lesbian after all? 

Three blissful weeks into our relationship, however, he evaporated into thin air, not answering any of my calls or my messages. That sorrowful afternoon, I missed him so badly that I kept on experiencing this feeling of lack kicking my belly again and again like a burglar wearing a stocking mask, breaking through my front door, throwing a guitar string over my head and pulling it against my throat as hard as he could. To get rid of this feeling, I ran into the bathroom, filled up the bath with just as much cold water as needed to fit my head, plunged my head in the water and screamed, persistently, as long as I could, to exorcize this nasty burglar. 

You have to understand: we were a love-triangle, Urdu, Ejaaz Hussain and me, - Barbara Bukowski; a m√©nage-a-trois, like they say. But what about your feelings for women, and Priyanka in particular, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d ask. Just wait. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll tell you everything that happened during my year abroad in India as a young student in due time, including my adventures with Priyanka. 

Let me first tell you, though, about Urdu and me: we are both orphans, unwanted children born out of wedlock. India didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want Urdu anymore and kicked her to Pakistan and my wretched catholic Polish mother shoved me ‚Ä" her extramarital baby - into the hands of a wealthy, trendy, fabulous Californian gay couple: my two dads, Karl and Michel, both highly successful plastic surgeons. 

Ten years fast forward back to 2014 but a month before that disgusting situation would bang on my front door in less than two minutes, I tasted my first words in Urdu. It was during my first class at the American Institute of Indian Studies in Lucknow, where I had secured myself a fellowship to escape attending med school at home. 

Between brackets: When my dads enrolled me into Harvard med school, I cried all night. After a while, when things settled down, I had found a program to study Urdu in Lucknow and I applied: at least this way, I thought at the time, I can provide medical services for poor people and do something good in the world. Plus, I would be away from the United Fake of America for a while. And last but not least, wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t Urdu considered a poetic language? And wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t becoming a poet my real dream? The dream, *nota bene*, dad Karl and dad Michel almost managed to crash? 

Right away, when my first Urdu words were rolling around my tongue in my mouth, I felt we were bonded, Urdu and I, as if I had been a ferocious Urdu-speaker myself in a previous life, maybe even a wandering poetess. And what I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know back then, of course, was that my biological mother actually was a poetess. 

After a few more classes, words like *mohabbat, ishq, intezaar, majzoob*, *iqlaab, zindabad *started humming in my head, louder than the jubilations of the Hindu Nationalists out in the streets. I could even hear these words in the *loo*, you know; the strong, hot, dry summer winds blowing from the West all over Northern India. These whispers made me crave to read all of Urdu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s literature and I developed a library addiction. I started exploring Mirza Ghalib, Sadat Husain Manto, Ismat Chukhtai, Naiyer Masud, Quratulain Haider, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and so on, nonstop, like a madwoman. I simply had to become fluent in Urdu, no matter what, even if it would be the last thing I would do on this earth. But there was a problem: a huge problem. No local wanted to speak in Urdu to me. Instead of talking Urdu to me, much to my exasperation, everybody wanted to practice their English with me. All that changed when Ejaaz Hussain busted into my life, during one of our Friday morning poetry workshops. 

And so, in spite of gradually but steadily becoming drunk that late, humid, sunny but sad afternoon in June, after I had screamed my lungs out in my bath water and calmed down a bit, I sat down in one of the cane armchairs I had bought from some gentleman or other, who had his whole showroom on the streets. I tried to forget about Ejaaz Hussain (and Priyanka too) ‚Ä" something indeed near-impossible but still - and focused instead on reading an Urdu newspaper aptly called *Aag*, meaning fire, something I had to do anyway for school. What was about to happen, that horrible thing I mentioned before, you know, the one that would make me question everything, would happen in less than one minute, but not even a single of the abundant blond hairs on my sweating scalp had a clue. 

With a dictionary, I was trying to decipher an article about a young woman who had committed suicide in a shopping mall called Fun Republic. The moment I started wondering if she might have been a victim of in-laws demanding a higher bride‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s price, ding dong, the bell rang. 

So it began. 

I quickly dumped the rest of my glass of wine into the cactus pot (no idea why) and enthusiastically jumped up. Naturally I thought it was Ejaaz Hussain. Wobblingly I ran into the living room. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Are you getting that, Barb?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>  Priyanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s soft, almost child-like voice echoed from her room. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Will do‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, I said half-loudly with a thick tongue. 

From Priyanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s room, florid baroque tunes were flowing. She always listened to classical music when she painted. It was her dream to become a famous painter, someone like Georgia O‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Keefe. But, like mine, her parents had forcefully enrolled her into law school. 

At the front door, I looked through the peephole. And there he was: Ejaaz Hussain! He was wearing his leather outfit again. In one hand he held his black helmet. He was wearing sunglasses. I felt a puppy within me, running around crazy and peeing out of sheer joy. Finally! I released a sigh and the butterflies inside my belly were going wild. But then suddenly this feeling turned into anger. I wanted to open the door, run to him and hug and kiss him but also wanted to slap him. Where the hell had he been? Why hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t he informed me about whatever was going on? He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even send me a text? Nothing? If he really cared for me, why did he leave me in the dark like that? 

I decided to unlock the door anyway. I simply was too thrilled to see him. How could I take my anger seriously? While other girls in high school and college had boyfriends, I always sat alone, eating my lunch in the company of my phone. Ejaaz Hussain was my first boyfriend. Perhaps he had lost his phone? Or somebody of his family died? His mother became ill? I tried to reason with myself. 

The moment, however, I almost finished turning the key; I heard a loud moan, seemingly from somewhere behind him, from the direction of the staircase. But this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s moan. This was clearly a woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sigh. My enthusiasm again shifted towards anger, and I started doubting him: the bastard has brought another woman with him? 

Looking through the peephole, I was puzzled to see a corpulent lady wearing a traditional Muslim *salwar kameez*, puffing and panting, leaning on her knees. Ejaaz Hussain, on the other hand, was looking in the direction of the peephole, shaking his head, gesturing wildly with his hands, I think, to not open the door. Then he made grimaces with his lips. It seemed he was trying to say, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t open‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. *What the heck is going on*, I wondered, getting seriously irritated. 

The corpulent lady was resting for a few moments after having taken the stairs. *Why didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she take the elevator?* I thought, but she looked like she came straight from some rural hamlet or other in the East of Uttar Pradesh, the most underdeveloped part of the state. Perhaps she was scared to take the elevator. I had seen rural women at the airport in New Delhi, hesitating for a long time before they dared to take the escalator. Could this be Ejaaz Hussain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother? Did he want to introduce me to his Mum? 

She came closer to the door and through the peephole I studied her face: chunky, swollen and seemingly very angry. Furious even. Then she closed one eye and tried to look into the peephole with the other. *What an idiot*, I remember thinking, *you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look inside from the outside, everybody knows that. * 

*How can she be the mother of an Indo-Persian prince who has won the Mr. Urdu contest for five consecutive years?* I asked myself. Almost as if she could hear my thoughts, her face turned even more sour, making her already chunky features look chunkier, as if someone had blown air into her facial muscles. Dad Karl and Dad Michel surely would have a lot of work with her. 

*This can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be Ejaaz Hussain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother, or not even his sister or cousin or whatever*, I concluded. She could definitely not be his lover or wife. That much was certain. I could not imagine tall and slender, elegant and witty, classy and well-spoken Ejaaz Hussain being intimate with this creature, this witch. That was impossible. Never. *Nunca. Jamais*. 

I wanted to shout, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Hey lady, who are you? Why are you banging on my door like a maniac?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> but then I saw that her head was hanging down and her body was trembling. She was sobbing.  Seeing all that made my hands tremble as well: I was flabbergasted, terrified but also felt sorry for her. And, unfortunately, what happened next didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly sooth me. The corpulent lady wiped her tears, came very close to the door, raised her right arm and made a fist. With a force I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen in a woman before, she started hitting the door, bang, bang, bang, almost like she had supernatural strength. She must have been desperate. The banging felt as if she was knocking on my sternum and my feet took a few steps back. 

Then she growled: 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Bitch, are you there?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

My heartbeat took a hike. The screams were muffled because the door was well insulated but the message was crystal clear. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Open the fucking door, bitch,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> the woman screamed at the top of her voice. 

I took another step back because, I hate to admit it, I was shitting in my pants ‚Ä" not really though, but you catch my drift. I took a deep breath and slowly I collected myself again, got back into the hallway and looked again. This time I saw Mr. Biswaas, our neighbor. He was a retired army officer. His wife divorced him when he started spending all his money on a Russian prostitute in Delhi. With Ejaaz he was trying to calm down the woman. Ejaaz was trying to pull her away. Then Mrs. Sharma appeared on the stage as well. She was our other neighbor. Her husband was an invalid, and because of that she was bored and always looking for some action. 

My fear turned into anger, and for a few fleeting seconds, it occurred to me to open the door in one quick jerk, confidently walk towards that lady, tell her I feel sorry she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going through rough time but that I will call the police if she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t leave. After all, I was a head taller than her, and I went to the gym at least three times a week. But then, I saw Mr. Valmiki, one of the guards, trying to squeeze himself into the scene as well. And Ejaaz Hussain was shaking his head and gesticulating not to open the door. 

Everything started to look blurry and chaotic from then on. Different bodies moved in different directions, there was un-understandable screaming, Mrs. Varma seemed to pull the lady‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arm in one direction, Mr. Biswaas pulled her arm in the other, Ejaaz Hussain tried to grab her from behind. Everything went so fast that I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see how the furious lady suddenly disappeared. 

Had she left? I started feeling relieved. Ejaaz Hussain looked in the direction of our door, still shaking his head. His forehead was wrinkled, and he looked extremely pale. He also seemed thinner than the last time I had seen him, a week ago. I felt sorry for him. But seeing that calm had returned, however, the adrenaline in my body slowly ebbed away. 

The moment a sigh from deep within my stomach wanted to escape my body, the woman reappeared from the staircase in full force. She ran like a mad elephant and smacked her full body against the door. That created such a loud bang, given that she was so corpulent, that I exited the hallway once again, trying to catch my breath in the drawing room. 

The moment, the lady yelled, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>open the fucking door, you filthy cunt; my name is Samra Hussain. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m Ejaaz Hussain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife, for crying out loud.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Priyanka ‚Ä" probably shaken up by the commotion or just plain curious ‚Ä" came galloping into the drawing room like a teenager interested in making trouble. For a few seconds everything seemed to have gone mute in my head, and an invisible pot ladle got pierced into my skull, stirring intensely what was left of my poor brain. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s married. He lied to me. I want to strangulate him,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I found myself muttering. 

Unfortunately, though, what I was afraid of actually happened: Privanka Sharma was standing in front of me wearing only a t-shirt and white panties. If that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough: her pubic hair was showing through. I simply couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t control my gaze. It continuously rolled towards her crotch. It was magnetic. This was very distracting because, after all, wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I in the middle of a relationship crisis of some sorts? Hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I just discovered that my first boyfriend ever actually is a married man? But then Priyanka smiled warmly at me. Or at least, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what I think she did. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Barbara Bukowski,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on, *Naca*?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Nacos are urban Indians from Mexico, but since her parents were Indians from India, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sure Priyanka meant it in different way. I smiled back at her, and for a moment the chaos at the other side of the hallway moved to the background. 

Parenthesis: Priyanka and I, we both were exactly 5 feet 9, a bit above the minimum height for female models. 

There we stood. Two tall women face to face and a crisis unfolding at the other side of the door. 

Her childlike olive-eyes met my eyes in a short but perfectly straight line. She was gorgeous. Just looking at her gave me goosebumps. Maybe therefore, I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t *really* mind the distracting pubic hair. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ringing the bell? Open up, *naca *‚Ä¶‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Then, unexpectedly, even to my own mind, I said: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Religious fanatics, sort of Jehovah Witnesses but the Hindu sort, or Muslim, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, sweetheart, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care. Show me your painting.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Priyanka was dying to be a painter. She was painting all the time. I hoped I could seduce her with my interest. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>What?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she said. 

Her beautiful face told me that she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe me. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Come on,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I said while holding her by her shoulder and turning her around. Gosh, this girl had soft skin. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Show me your painting.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

We started walking hand in hand in the direction of her room, but then Ejaaz Hussain‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife seemed to have gone totally berserk and started threatening me in Urdu: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>*tujhe marwa denge, kamini kutti*,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she yelled like a witch which means, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to have you killed, you worthless bitch.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Wow, what the fuck is going on,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Priyanka said. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>What is she saying?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Despite her Indian heritage, Priyanka didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speak much Hindi or Urdu. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Nothing sweetheart,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I said pokerfaced but my bladder turned instantly full. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You know these new born Christian types, they become upset easily,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I tried to look innocent but I felt terribly embarrassed and started sweating. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s see your beautiful painting,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I insisted. 

Then Priyanka grinned. Her little girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face started looking mischievous, like that of a little boy who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about to discover the pleasure of setting things on fire. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Hey,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>let me see who this monster is,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, and ran in the direction of the hallway. 

Her pubic hair distracted me again, but I still managed to run towards her and squeeze myself between her and the door of the hallway. She bumped against me: her torso against mine. The distance between us couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly be called prudish, and I felt ticklish. Our faces stood still at an inch from each other. I could smell her breath. It smelled sweet, like strawberries. Of course, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t smoke. Did I say ticklish? I could have kissed her. But I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I would ever dare. She was too beautiful. I had been called beautiful too but, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, she was breathtaking. Besides, if I would have taken the lead‚Ä¶ 

Lost in all these little ponderings that take lots of time to talk about but moved like a high-speed train in my head and thus didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take up more than ten seconds really, I suddenly remembered the matrimonial thing again and I thought in anguish: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>How the hell will I become fluent in Urdu now?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Quickly I turned around, opened the door, ran into the hallway and looked through the peephole of the front door. There was nobody. Even Ejaaz had disappeared. My anger had made way for fear, fear that I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t manage to become fluent in Urdu without Ejaaz and thus would have to work in the plastic surgery clinic of my two dads. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Let me see as well,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Priyanka pouted, finally succeeding in pushing me away. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Okay then, if you so insist,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I told her like I was her older sister. 

I tried to remove my gaze away from her boyish, or girlish, or perhaps both or neither ‚Ä" I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not sure ‚Ä" but nevertheless very arousing silhouette, walked back into drawing room, came standing in front of the window and looked outside. There I saw Ejaaz standing just outside of the gates, arguing with his wife while our guards were staring at him. It struck me that from far Ejaaz Hussain looked more like a bum than an artist: a real bum. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Hey‚Ä¶there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nobody there,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Priyanka said. 

I saw that Ejaaz tried to come close to his wife but some buffed guy carrying a rifle over his shoulder, definitely not one of our guards, and wearing pitch-black sun glasses first came standing between them and then escorted Samra into an ambassador car that had two little flags above its headlights. When I saw that these two little flags had the symbol of the BJP, the Hindu nationalist party, I became terrified. Ejaaz, looking like a real bum, a dog really with his tail between his legs, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help much either and the image of this buffed guy shooting me flashed through my head. After all, since they won the election, BJP supporters had lynched people they suspected of selling beef. Still, I felt a refusal within me to go back home. Never again I wanted to be part of that artificial world of appearances, where my body would be psychologically taxed with surgical precision. Only Urdu could help me. I was thoroughly convinced of that. And for that I needed Ejaaz Hussain. Of that too, I was thoroughly convinced. 

Leaning on the car door with her elbow, Samra looked in the direction of our apartment. Boy, what an ice-cold gaze, like she was a witch casting a spell. Then she got in and the car drove off. Ejaaz looked dumbfounded, like a shrugged off vagrant. He stared in the direction of our apartment for almost a minute or so, pressing his eyelids and shaking his shoulders. *Charisma truly is as fleeting as a fart*, I caught myself thinking but then I got worried again about my Urdu. 

Ejaaz finally managed to flag down a cycle-taxi. I studied how his back slowly started to disappear in the dust. I felt sorry for him. He looked defeated. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s E?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Priyanka, walking into the drawing room, said. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a note here. Your so-called religious fanatics have left you a message. It says ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Thank God you didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t open the door. Will come soon. Kisses. E. Is it the E that I think it is?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Priyanka came standing next to me and together we watched Ejaaz turning around one more time and looking in our direction, before he disappeared completely from our view. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Oh, it is.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> She giggled but, I just found myself thinking in Urdu about Urdu, Priyanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pubic hair, lesbian women, matrimonial fights, my two dads in West Hollywood, the relationship between Sadaat Hasan Manto and David Foster Wallace and that I simply had to become fluent in Urdu no matter what. 

But feeling terrified that I might never become fluent in Urdu and that I would be forced to live with my two dads, or that I might not even survive this adventure at all, I grabbed Priyanka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand and heard my mouth say, painting *dikhao, meri tamanna*. Urdu had spoken through me. 

And Priyanka said: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>babe, your Urdu sounds so sexy.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>
