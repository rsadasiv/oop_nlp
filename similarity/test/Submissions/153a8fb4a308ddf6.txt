*Title- Shrimps for dinner* 

I was seated beside Mom, in the kitchen. 

She held the limp shrimp in front of my eyes. 

Devoid of its shell, it did not look threatening anymore. 

â€<sup>~</sup>See, this is your father.â€<sup>TM</sup> she said. 

When I scrunched my eyebrows, she clarified, â€<sup>~</sup>He is spineless like this shrimp. Get it?â€<sup>TM</sup> 

I did not. 

â€<sup>~</sup>Repeat after me. S-p-i-n-e-l-e-s-s.â€<sup>TM</sup>, she insisted. 

So I repeated it after her. Without comprehending it. Without questioning it. Like most of the prayers I had been taught as a kid. 

But when I stood by our bedroom door analyzing Dad from behind, looking at the knobs on his spine I wondered what Mom was talking about. 

Whenever she was within my earshot, I would hear her murmur something about Dad. Always something negative. About how he didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t do this. Didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t do that. How he could never do anything. 

She thought of him all the time. Was it love or hate for him that had consumed her so completely? Was it the fusion of both? Is one emotion incomplete without the other? I wonder now. 

Back then, I wanted to understand her, myself, Dad. What we meant to each other, as a whole, as a family but I did not know how to sieve my emotions, let alone theirsâ€<sup>TM</sup>. 

Dad would return every three months or so. I never counted the days until his homecoming the way people did in movies by crossing out the dates on the calendar with a permanent marker. I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have to. The rising tempo of Momâ€<sup>TM</sup>s murmurs was my cue. 

One murmur that stayed with me throughout the years is â€<sup>~</sup>Dad is a spare on the ship and it is only his â€<sup>~</sup>illusionâ€<sup>TM</sup> that he is needed there, the truth isâ€<sup>TM</sup>, Mom stressed the words, â€<sup>~</sup>he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have the balls to quit.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

I hoped she wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be so bitter in his absence. His presence made her uncomfortable but his absence made it worse. 

She apologized and then said, â€<sup>~</sup>He doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have balls.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Her apology was her regret at not having delivered the punchline correctly and not because she was diminishing a father in his sonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s eyes. 

Mom claimed that when I was a baby I had been afraid to go into Dadâ€<sup>TM</sup>s arms as I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t recognize him on his return. 

â€<sup>~</sup>Which father will do that? Come and go every few months? Things change every day! A person can be a whole new person after few months!â€<sup>TM</sup> She would say. 

Was she talking about herself? 

She loved providing examples to leverage her points. So she guided me to the pot in our living room. I stared at the small plant. â€<sup>~</sup>Werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you there for it since you sowed the seed?â€<sup>TM</sup> I nodded. â€<sup>~</sup>He wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t there when you first started to crawl or walk..why does he even come back?â€<sup>TM</sup> She asked me. 

I remember a few scenes of Dadâ€<sup>TM</sup>s return during my childhood. Mom would slap him after a disagreement but he never raised his hand, not even his voice. It looked like a game to me as a kid- when he sat down on the sofa and scooped me in his arms, I slapped him at the exact spot that his cheek had turned pink and he always played along turning his other cheek too. 

Dad was like a guest in his own home asking Mom for directions to things kept in the house. She would exercise her power to the fullest and make the experience no less than a treasure hunt for him, an impossible one that too. Once he had asked Mom for a coaster- his favourite coaster for his beer glass. Mom seemed to enjoy the fact that he admitted that it was his â€<sup>~</sup>favouriteâ€<sup>TM</sup>. She told me to look for it and that if I found it she would reward me with a chocolate. Not just any chocolate. Toblerone.  I can still feel the way my eyes popped out. It was my favourite. 

The look of despair on Dadâ€<sup>TM</sup>s face while I moved my little body with enthusiasm to find his favourite coaster for my favourite chocolate made me feel I was doing something wrong. I was too small to understand he was on my side. I thought he thought I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t do it. Then he scooped me in his arms and told me to abandon my search as he didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want it anymore. I cried, I hated him, he was the only barrier between me and Toblerone. He bought it for me but Mom had warned me that if I ate it she would ground me for a week after Dad left so I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have it. I hated him even more. He had tried to slip the chocolate into my mouth when Mom was in the loo but I had pursed my lips tight. Was he trying to get me killed? 

As I grew a little Dad didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t seem bad to me. He never hit me. He never hit Mom. Then what made him evil in Momâ€<sup>TM</sup>s eyes? Did she want him to hit either of us? Would she say then that he has balls? 

She would make me sleep in between them. I felt special. Only later did I realize that she was icing Dad out. They never kissed each other goodnight like the couples in movies. They never hugged. They never addressed each other as â€<sup>~</sup>sweetieâ€<sup>TM</sup> or â€<sup>~</sup>darlingâ€<sup>TM</sup>. 

After sometime she made me sleep with Dad in the living room because apparently our endless chattering disturbed her sleep. 

She enjoyed torturing him in small ways. Whenever he returned home he would find new things in the house and old things re-arranged. Like the vase of artificial flowers which used to be on the coffee table would suddenly be on top of the refrigerator and when he pointed it out, she would say â€<sup>~</sup>Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s how you remember the house? Seriously? You good for nothing, worthless SHRIMPâ€¦â€<sup>TM</sup> 

One day I struck up the nerve to ask Mom. â€<sup>~</sup>Mom Iâ€¦saw you changing the position of the TV but when Dad asked you about it you said you hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t touched it. Why did you lie Mom? You told me one should never lie.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

She approached me as if she hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t heard me and then grabbed my shoulders, her long nails dug into my flesh. â€<sup>~</sup>Youâ€¦will become like your spineless Dad. You will. Understand? You wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t turn out any different..so donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even try.â€<sup>TM</sup> And then she shoved me. 

Maybe she hated Dad more than I guessed. Why didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t she leave him then? Was she staying only because of me? 

Once when she was hugging me I wanted to ask her, â€<sup>~</sup>Mom, do you love Dad?â€<sup>TM</sup> (I knew Dad loved her and if as a kid I could figure that out, couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t she? For all the provocation she channeled at him he hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t lost his cool. Ever. Did he rein his anger just because of me? Was I the only thread keeping them together?) Instead I asked â€<sup>~</sup>Mom, do you and Dad love each other?â€<sup>TM</sup> 

She snorted as if I had said something ridiculous. â€<sup>~</sup>Oh my poor innocent child. Love is courageous. You need to have a spine for that. Your Dad doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have one, you would have figured by now.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Did she hear me wrong? Was she talking about herself? Was she incapable of loving or leaving? 

One day Dad told me I could accompany him on the ship. I was excited. It was my summer vacation. I packed my favourite things in my backpack, he told me that he hoped I wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get seasick and luckily I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t. 

On the ship, he earned respect naturally. The look in everyoneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s eyes as they greeted him was not born of fear, like I had for my teacher but that of awe. 

Maybe Dad is important after all. Why wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t he like this at home? Maybe then Mom would respect him like these people do. 

After two days on the ship, he got a message from Mom. â€<sup>~</sup>Donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t look for me. Take care of Dion.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know why but I remembered the way Mom had pushed me and Dad to sleep away from her. Was she preparing me for this? Did she care about me more than I thought she did? She could have left without bothering about me. Or did that make her more evil and calculative? I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know. Hatred for her swelled in me. 

Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m glad I had never asked Dad before about why Mom stayed depressed all the time. How could I have not seen it all along? He was the victim. Not her. 

Dad stared at the message. I tried to read his expression. Had he expected this? Did he bring me on the ship so it would be easier for her to leave? Was he capable of loving Mom much more than I had expected? Did he do it for me? Did he know that I was beginning to see the difference between good and evil? Did he want to rescue me before I could be scarred for life? 

Would Dad and Mom have even separated had I not been born? Was it me? 

I shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t play the victim here. I looked at Dad. 

I hugged him. I wanted to protect him from Mom. To apologise for all the pain she caused him. She wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hurt us anymore Dad, I wanted to say. 

He looked at me and said, â€<sup>~</sup>We have shrimps for dinner.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Maybe I do want to become like Dad. Maybe Mom never saw him for who he is. 

Three shrimps arrived in a plate curled up like babies in the womb. I looked at the plate and at Dad. Dad definitely had a spine. One had to have a spine to raise a child on their own, right? 

Mom knew that too or she wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have left me in his care. Maybe she was indeed talking about herself all the time. But how could she leave me? Wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t she miss me? What wrong did I do? But then Dad didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t do anything wrong either. 

I looked at the shrimps in the plate, I lifted one with my fork. 

I imagined Momâ€<sup>TM</sup>s curled body as if she was sleeping, somewhere far away, away from me and Dad, smiling in her sleep. 

I drowned the shrimp in my throat with a large gulp of water. I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t feel guilty about it.
