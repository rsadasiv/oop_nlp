A FINE FAMILY 

*R Suryanarayan wrote me a month ago. A Facebook Message. We weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>friends‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. And so his message was a shock. Also the fact that he wrote from California. It was just one line and a link to a blog post. **‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Hi, here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something you might want to check out.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> The blog was his own. There was a solitary post and a photograph. It was Suryanarayan and another man, who looked vaguely familiar. They were shaking hands, weak smiles on tired-looking faces. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Rangan returns‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> was the caption. The name, Rangan was the key. It took me back two decades. * 

*************************************** 

It had been a sweltering summer, one of the hottest that India had been through. Terrorists had been active in the capital. There was no end to the bomb blasts that consistently and with nagging regularity shook the city. Mysterious fires burnt to a cinder almost all the hutments in the capital. The PM was facing dissidence and opposition in his own party. The Opposition was screaming itself hoarse over the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>crisis in prices‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. The stock market teetered on the brink of collapse. Engineered dissidence had led to the downfall of many state governments. A northern state faced a near civil war. Naxalites terrorized people in a southern state and a cyclone ravaged it. All in all, a long summer of discontent. 

I was then only fifteen and happened to be in Delhi on vacation. A lot seemed to be happening around me. But I was bored. Fifteen days in the Delhi heat was more than I could take. Surrounded by loud-mouthed relatives all of whom had only one question to ask me ‚Ä" ‚ÄoeAhem! So what plans for the future?‚Äù ‚Ä" I was losing all patience. I strolled in and out of the house with a grumpy expression and generally ignoring everyone round me. Raju Mama probably noticed this and one evening, as I lay mindlessly stretched out in front of the TV, he came up to me and proclaimed, ‚Äoe You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d better get up early tomorrow. We have to clean the attic.‚Äù 

It turned out to be more than just a cleaning of the attic. In the course of the cleaning, a few things tumbled out. There were some photographs, all set in metal frames, a few medals and a cap much the worse for wear. The photographs were all of the same person posing with people I recognized as my grandparents, my mother and a few of my uncles. A few were photographs taken at school. Raju Mama was unresponsive to my questions about who the person in question was. He replied initially in monosyllables and soon asked me to beat it. Scared and amazed, I beat a hasty retreat. 

Many weeks later when I was back home, I tried to speak to my mother about my Delhi find. 

‚ÄoeThey belonged to Rangan.‚Äù, was her cryptic reply. 

To my ‚ÄoeRangan who?‚Äù her reaction was swift and blunt, ‚ÄoePut them away!‚Äù 

I prodded no more. But the questions buzzed in my head. Who was Rangan? Why was everyone so reluctant to speak about him? 

Appa had watched my little exchange with Amma from a distance. His voice assumed a prophetic tone, he let out a long sigh and arching his eyebrows in the manner of a man weighed down by dark secrets said, ‚ÄoeHe is your mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brother. Your uncle.‚Äù He paused. 

‚ÄoeHe used to be so different from your other uncles. They never really liked him.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou knew him?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes. But not when he was part of the family. I met him in prison.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou? He? Prison!‚Äù It was getting a bit much. 

Another lengthy pause. It was like I was watching a mystery movie. I sat chewing my fingernails waiting with bated breath what was to happen next. Appa took his time. 

‚ÄoeIn Central Jail.‚Äù he announced. Without waiting for my reaction, he continued, ‚ÄoeYou know me. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been around.‚Äù Didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I know that? Amma and he clashed forever on that matter. Appa was a political animal. Activism, demonstrations, seminars, human rights ‚Ä" all of that was his thing. He was a doctor like Amma. But a different sort. Amma ran a nursing home. Appa was also part of it. Atleast the signboards proclaimed his name and qualifications. But, he flitted in and out. There was plenty on his plate. And Amma was often on her own. I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t surprised to hear that Appa had been in jail at some point. But, to meet Amma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brother there? Now that was a story worth prying out. 

You see, Amma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family ‚Ä" immediate and extended -- had placed itself on a pedestal. They surveyed the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>natives‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> from ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>up there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. They were different. High academic achievers. Corporate climbers. Bureaucratic machines. Always at the top of their form. Plotting and scheming their next move. The family was a sacred grouping and it moved together. And it was all up. Anything that deterred movement was cut away like diseased flesh. 

‚ÄoeYou are too young to have heard the story about an assassination attempt on the then Home Minister many years ago.‚Äù I nodded. I was too young. A soldier had apparently attacked a minister as he inspected a guard of honour. 

‚ÄoeWho do you think it was? The very same Rangan. They court martialled and imprisoned him. The family refused to have anything to do with him. They wrote him out of their lives.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBut why did he turn out that way?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeRangan was a different sort. A stray electron. Full of passion, wild, the non-academic sort. You know what that means in a family like your mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you? They didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bother to understand him. He joined the army on a whim. The discipline was too much for him. And presto! He exploded one fine day for no reason at all.‚Äù Appa summed it all up and left the scene. There was actually very little that he had offered as an explanation. 

But I had been part of the family long enough to imagine what might have transpired. Appa himself had half-seriously dubbed the family ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Mafia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. Deviant members were bumped off so to speak. In Rangan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s case, he was quite simply cast out into the night. I remember the sliver of sympathy that had crept into me when I had imagined Rangan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s plight. I remember thinking to myself that he certainly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t explode for no reason at all. Living with ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> was perhaps reason enough. I remember wondering how Appa with his politics and disdain for social climbing had managed. I also remember that I had actually contemplated doing a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Rangan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. But that was not to be. Amma and Appa split up soon after. There was no contact with Appa thereafter. Amma forbade it. I stayed back with Amma and toed the line. 

********************************************** 

Suryanarayan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s message was a startling reminder of how far I had travelled. Two decades had passed. I was now a doctor, a bachelor and a Facebook man. Years with Amma had resulted in my conversion to the cause. I was a dedicated ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> man too. To Amma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s abiding delight, a cousin and I had put together a Facebook page dedicated to her family. An ego wall of the family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s accomplishments. Mug-shots and pen potraits of the illustrious. A beacon of inspiration to the next generation. Or so we hoped. 

And now this message from Suryanarayan. I could have done without it. But we were inextricably linked. The S that was part of my name was his. Suryanarayan! He was my father. *Appa!* 

My activist father who now lived in California. He had been absent for twenty years and now he was back. Should I condescend to respond? How dare he? He had left me behind. And after all these years, he had announced his re-entry into my life via Rangan. Initially, I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t quite sure what I had to do. 

After close to two weeks, I felt confident enough to defy my mother ‚Ä" *Amma!* I wrote to Appa. He wrote me back and I wrote back. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t yet a close relationship. But I hoped it would become that. At the moment, it remained a vaguely defined one. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know the details of his life. What was he doing in California, for instance? His life since his divorce. He hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t yet bothered asking me too many things. In a way, it was a relief. Amma and her family did all that. Dragged me along like a puppy on a leash. But in the last couple of weeks, we had shared a few stray thoughts. On movies. Books. TV shows. We talked about today. We had shared fifteen years together many years ago. Appa had come and gone then. And he hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been a constant factor in my growing-up years. But, he had been around. We hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t yet spoken about that. It was as if each was waiting for the other to make the first move. 

Yesterday, Appa wrote me again. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>How is Amma?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, he wanted to know. This message was one more reference to a shared past. Our ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>friendship‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> had kicked off with one reference. Now here was another. It is a past that Appa and I have to come to terms with. And Amma has to, as well. 

From this message, I went to THE page. The ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Family Page‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. I stared at the mug-shots and other photographs of the achievers receiving awards. Shaking hands with celebrities. There were mundane posts of people ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>recovering from bereavements‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, academic landmarks achieved, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>aforementioned‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> people who were going to be in such and such city on such and such date et al. 

*They are indeed an illustrious set of people. The whole lot of them. But I think this long list of mug shots omits two more ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>achievers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. One who had been a relation by marriage. And another, flesh of their flesh, blood of their blood.  To this gallery, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to add the names of these two men. I think you know the ones I mean.*
