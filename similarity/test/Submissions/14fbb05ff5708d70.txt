*Makeover* 

Fruity, milky, lemony, buttery; the odors discern one coated face from the other, of women in orange kaftans and red headbands tied close to their hairlines. That, and the state of the thick creamy concoction spread evenly on their faces; some still moist and cool, others in varying stages of drying up (you could almost see the vapors rising from the skin through the layered mud) and finally the ones which are cracking like patches of famine affected earth, the sighs of discomfort as the human flesh beneath gets squeezed under the plastering effect of the natural mud base and the artificial congealers. 

Herbal or Shehnaz? Pearl or gold? Black or blonde? You are given the choices based on the height of your heels, shimmer of your simple, yet insanely overpriced salwar kameez and the number of dazzling diamonds or other precious stones on the pendant that hangs by a thread of gold, which in your case, is dangling within the deep recesses of your femininity. 

You choose the most exclusive and expensive â€<sup>~</sup>special A1 packageâ€<sup>TM</sup> as it is known in the inner circles of the privileged few, which includes you. The cash transaction, which involves several wads of crisp green rupee notes, is concluded without a bill or any other document of proof and you are guardedly shown into an anteroom via the several labyrinthine corridors, into the bowel of the establishment, hidden from the world outside and specifically reserved for the most valuable and returning customers whose first entry is strictly based on trusted recommendation. You enter the room, but not before attempting to pass one last contemptuous look at the ordinary women seated in the poorly air-conditioned room near the entrance, who suffer through the futile pains of looking beautiful, painting their faces and dyeing their hair, mercilessly pulling out all the redundant hairs on their eye brows, chin, arms, legs and underarms, but somewhere between the twists and turns that took you to where you are standing right now, you have lost them. The door shuts behind you and you stand facing your future; the serene and almost unemotional face of your personalized beauty assistant. 

Because this is not your first time here, you know she did not speak the language of the tongue. She would nod and smile and point and would even hold your head between her palms and turn you around, but when you part, you are left wondering what she sounded like. There are times when you even suspected that she and the rest of them had their tongues clamped or chopped off before being accepted to master the procedure. Nevertheless, there were those fingers; those dexterous, expert fingers that worked on you from top to toe with tenderness, with efficiency, the thought of which sends ripples of orgasmic shivers through your entire body and you observe the parade of a million goosebumps on every part of your now naked body. 

The boxes are ready and waiting. On your first visit, you thought the little white cubes without names or pictures of anything perfect or imperfect were empty and arranged in a pyramidal fashion with exactly fifty at the base and a single one reveling at the top to add to the aesthetics of the room. But that was until a similar looking beauty assistant grabbed one from the fourth row by displacing and later replacing every single one above it and opened it with a pop. No liquid bubbled out, there was nothing visible from where you sat, but the room was suddenly filled with the smell of a swamp. She held the box open for you to catch a glimpse of the full skin suit, two shades darker than you were then, with a canopy of close cropped black hair, two dark brown eyes, a wide nose, a pair of immaculately plucked arched eyebrows and plump lips the deepest shade of maroon. That was you, you had decided, just what you had wanted all the while. 

Four seasons, four sessions and four faces later, you are again ready for a new outfit. The skin that is chosen for you this time is rosy pink, the hair blond, the nose aquiline and the eyes, the shade of brilliant emerald. You nod your head in consent and lie down on the couch as the assistant begin peeling off your skin from your flesh. You are almost like a plucked chicken after the procedure that only mildly tickles you, leaving the buff colored meat revealed and glistening. The trained hands expertly proceed, leaving not one additional scratch or a droplet of blood on you. Your eyes remain closed, only because buff is not your favorite color of you. Momentarily, the veil over your cornea and pupil are also pulled off and for an instant, you try imagining what shade your eyes are. Albino perhaps, but then you decide you did not want to know. 

The voiceless girl removes the new skin from the unmarked box and straightens the creases. She holds it open for you to step into it. Legs first, followed by the hands and finally the head. She adjusts the seams under your feet, pumps up your breasts for them to stand taut and then caresses your hair, as if willing the skin to grow into you. You can feel the tendrils sprouting, growing, piercing your flesh and finally setting itself tight and wound around you. You are whole once again and cannot help watching yourself on the mirror for several minutes, until the assistant gently taps you on the shoulder and points to a neatly folded pile of clothes for you. Obviously, the salwar kameez that you donned at entry would not go with the new you, so the establishment offers the first pair of perfect clothes for your new looks. Perfect it is, a mauve t-shirt and a denim short skirt that makes you the stunning Caucasian that you are now. With long, confident strides, you exit the room, but through another door, meant only for renovated customers. 

You are ready and good to go into the world again. Baked brown, pale yellow, seductive black, Indian wheat, you have tried it all, and you have enjoyed every moment of your uniqueness. The unknowing ones around you would gape and ogle at you, not knowing that you are the same you, and that their offers and pleadings tire you in their unimaginative repetition, and yet you would prod their senses, taunt and haunt them, surrender when it pleases you and finally when you are bored, return to the establishment through the front door and exit once more through the one in the back, unrecognizable. 

Yet, the fear is always there. The bottles do not seem to increase or decrease in count. You worry about all the used skins, perhaps given an antiseptic treatment, dried, ironed and gathered into a new box. Somewhere in the pyramid of countless boxes, there could be a few that hold what was once you. And someday, when you walk on the road, you will meet an old you who speaks and acts differently, and suddenly, you might begin wondering which of the two you really are.
