I was born and brought up in Dehradun, and did my schooling at a boarding school located there. A journalism graduate, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve also studied Business Management, English Literature and am currently pursuing a course in Narrative Filmmaking. I have worked as an entrepreneur, freelance videographer and briefly as a journalist as well. I have traveled extensively around the subcontinent and have a special affinity for the Himalayas, particularly as a trekking destination. My interests include Travel, Hiking, Literature, Music and Film. I currently live in Prague in the Czech Republic. 


*THE CYCLIST * 

*by Saumya Tyagi* 

Outside the window, across the narrow Sutlej valley, stood the bare massif of the Kinner Kailash, with its saw-toothed peaks lit by the rising sun. I lay in bed, awake, as the dim morning light filtered though the dirty panes and onto the dusty wooden floor, watching the women congregate on the roof of the village temple across the street. Enwrapped in their dull-red parkas, huddled around a stove, they sat talking softly among themselves, some of them knitting, chanting beads. 

I could hear the town coming to life, faint sounds floating through the air, the dull thumping of an engine down the road, dogs barking, loud cackling of the magpies as they flew through the pines, the sputtering of a motorcycle hurriedly fading away and muffled voices of people, probably from the tea shop. 

I hurried down the road and across the taxi stand where, to my relief, the only daily bus out was still there, with its engine idling, being loaded up for the journey downhill. Aziz the driver recognized me and walked to where I was standing. He pulled hard at the *bidi  *( hand-rolled cigarette) before passing it to me. Taking it I handed him the rucksack filled with hiking gear I needed to send to Shimla, the trekking season all but over with the first snows. He took it and tucked it under the drivers seat while telling me of a landslide on the road below. 

It was still early and cold out, and the only people on the street were the ones leaving town. They came in groups, bent under the weight of  their sacks, carrying grain, potatoes, gas cylinders, trekking equipment. A few dogs lay curled up, too lazy and cold to move. The wind too had picked up and you could hear the flapping of the prayer flags tied to the  roofs. I stubbed the *bidi* and headed into the tea shop. It was dark and warm inside and the heavy smell of burnt wood filled the air. 

I must have fallen asleep again for when I woke up he was already there, leaning against the wall, his back to me, nervously shuffling through the contents of his rucksack. But I knew it is him right away. He turned around, much leaner and a little bent but with that same air of purposeful intent. He drew out his spectacles and cleaned the moisture off  with his T-shirt before he put them on and acknowledged my presence with a nod. 

Outside the rain had begun to fall. Water fell down in thin wavering strings off the corrugated rooftops, running down the road, flooding the roughly built polythene choked drains. By the door of the tea shop leaned an old touring bicycle, its cables all frayed,  sings of wear like teeth marks all over its bare body. Looking almost as lean and decrepit as him. 

He squatted across the fire from me his trembling palms dotted with flattened blisters. His face and arms were heavily tanned too and you could see that the skin had shredded off at the bridge of his nose and knuckles exposing the redder tissue underneath. His hair was thin and gray but he still wore it long, tied loosely in a ponytail. 

'Sharma. It's you isn't it?' I said. 

He looked at me for a long moment and then smiled. 

'Hey, fancy finding you here old champ,â€<sup>TM</sup> followed by a loud guffaw. â€<sup>~</sup>What the hell are you doing here?' 

'I've been here for a while.â€<sup>TM</sup> I said. 

'Really? Why?â€<sup>TM</sup> 

'Just taking some time off.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

'Time off from what?â€<sup>TM</sup> 

That was a rhetorical question. And he took over the conversation as he usually did. I made myself comfortable with my back to the wall, sipping the warm tea. He continued to talk while setting out his wet clothes to dry above and around the wooden stove, about last night when he had cycled up to the village through the snow and cold and then of his first visit here about  two decades ago and eventually of his years of travels in the Himalayas in general. 

He spoke without invitation and carried on as if he wasn't addressing any particular person but a general audience, like he was repeating something he had, over time, learned to say, but sometimes his sentences died half way or he moved on from one incident to an unconnected another without warning. Sometimes he f ell dead silent in the middle of a story like he has too much to say or was arranging the facts in a coherent manner or as if he wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t sure of any of it anymore. This absentmindedness was new in him and I found it strangely out of character with the loud, gregarious man he usually was. 

*We snuck out of the hostel that night, the four of us to get something to eat. Two on each bicycle we paddled quietly down along the bamboos by the main field facing the junior hostels, by the house masters residence and then out toward the back field along which ran a raised road a kilometer and a half long leading us out to the back gate. Hiding the bikes in a scraggly bougainvillea  we jumped over the wall and sprinting the first hundred meters or so till we were out of the reach of the halogen**s.* 

*We **called* *it **Usman's. A dirty shack in the *basti* (slum) beyond the school grounds** where Usman a middle aged drunk lived with his aging wife.* *We banged at the tin sheet door and after a brief interval his sleepy-eyed wife opened the door and let us in. Inside a** few broken wooden benches l**ined** a **tiny **courtyard **adjoining a crammed kitchen area**.   * 

*In the dull light of a bulb hanging from the roof she cooked **noodles and omelets **for us. We were famished and lapped it up, trying to fill up on bread, soaking it in the warm soupy noodles. Once we were done, Sharma took out a scrap of paper stuffed in  a roll of crumpled tens. It was a list of people we were to carry take-away for.* 

*We walked back in the shadow of the junior hostel wall, all four of us, single file, talking in whispers, me and Sharma with the bikes, our eyes on the three storied building ahead where we had spent the last decade of our lives, looking out for any movement beyond its dark windows. And then a light on the third floor came on, a silhouette in one of the windows yelled something incomprehensible and then someone among us shouted run or fuck or some other inane exclamation and I remember dropping the plastic bag with the * *food **still warm **right there, getting on the bike and  riding it hard all the way back and **away from the hostels and toward the squash courts**. * 

*And so I pedaled hard, my heart beating audibly, my calves burning from the sudden strain, leaning ahead, trying to push as much force as I could down to my legs while the bike creaked and moaned. And then Sharma overtook me. He too was leaning and panting but seemed more in control. His back held straight as his legs worked away. We were both too far down the road for anybody to spot us but he held on to the pace. And **so** I pushed harder** too**, gaining momentum, the bike now swaying from side to side underneath me as I used up what felt like the last strain of energy within me, pedaling hard, wild with effort, and it pushed me almost alongside Sharma when he brake**d coming to a stop by the side* *and I, looking at him amazed, behind me, lost control and skidded off the road flying sideways onto the stone pavement, rolling over my shoulder, with a scraping sound and underneath it the thin hollow crumbling of a collar bone. * 

It has been a week since I first met him at the tea shop but I knew he had not left town. Every morning I saw Sanjay the gatekeeper-cook at the PWD guesthouse walk down the road onto the market to buy supplies for the day, food, kerosene and sometimes medicines. So I wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t surprised when I found him at my door late that night, agitated and nervous. 

We walked up a narrow stretch of stairs that climbed right through the main square to the road that circled the ridge overlooking the village. The wind was quiet and the sky clear. Sanjay, a short, silent man  told me that he found Sharma lying on the floor convulsing, his body and face strained like he was being pulled apart from the inside. 

Sharma had soon fainted and Sanjay had helped him to the bed. We he woke he regained his composure right away but still looked weak and drained, and only when Sanjay, scared of having a man die on his watch, threatened him with calling the police had Sharma asked him to go fetch me. 

I found him out at the balcony with a glass of rum in his hands and an uncorked  bottle of old monk on the table. He seemed pleased to see me and asking Sanjay to get another glass sank back into the cane chair. 

It's was a rare windless night for this time of the year and I could hear the purling waters of a muddy Sutlej deep down in the narrow gorge below. 

'You know I was thinking about that time we were racing in the back field, on the way back from Usman's. Did we ever find out who was that yelling up on the third floor?' I said. 

'You mean the time your raced yourself to the ground'. he said. 

â€<sup>~</sup>Yesâ€<sup>TM</sup> 

â€<sup>~</sup>Seems like a lifetime ago.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

'I guess. Did you ever go back to school?' I said. 

'No, not really. Some place that was though.' 

'It was.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

'You know I am heading for Tabo' he said. 

'I know, you told me. It will be colder there'. 

'Yes fewer people.' 

'When are you planning to leave.' 

'Tomorrow, early.' 

One of the first things you learned at boarding school and lived by was to let things be. You didn't interfere. It was always good policy to let people find their own way even if that meant they took a few knocks. And wasn't that one of the reasons that I had been here all this while, so as to not interfere, to let the world get along by itself. 

I left him bent over his baggage, carefully sorting his belongings, tick marking in a small notebook he held in his palm. Back in school, so many decades ago now, I remembered him as a slightly awkward but intent kid. Someone particular about things. Bespectacled, always there before time. One of those who stood ahead in the assembly line, ready to engage. Who had his Sunday clothes ready and laid out while we were still snatching at shirts in the laundry room. He had this quality of assurance I so clearly remember, a self knowledge about what he thought he could do and what he couldn't, and a real instinctual intention to do it well and I always thought that that made things more simpler for him. 

I stayed awake for long that night. Sitting at my desk trying to write but nothing came. I scribbled a thought and tried to elaborate on it but it went nowhere and I found myself staring into the dark out the window again, looking at the flickering sky. And sometime just before dawn, after the women at the temple had stepped out onto the roof with their stove I fell asleep.
