The banks of Ganga 

*Haradwar, the gateway to Shiva.* 

The river was flowing faster than Shiv had imagined. 

He had asked Appa about Ganga when they were on their way to Haradwar. 

‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a dirty river filled with old clothes and dead people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ashes‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAnd dead bodies‚Äù Sarath had added, gleefully torturing his na√Øve younger brother and laughing as shiv scratched him and cribbed to their mother- ‚ÄoeMaa, look at what he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s saying ma‚Ä"I want to go back!‚Äù 

But here they were, on the banks of Ganga, sitting in the balcony of their hotel. Shiv had never seen a river before. He had been to the beach a lot. But the river was different: it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have waves that crawl from the horizon, lash out with pride, fall at your feet, and walk back only to try again. The river just flowed. It flowed faster than Shiv had imagined. It was cleaner too. 

The crowd was starting to pour into the opposite bank for the evening Pooja. If you looked at the steps leading to the river, all you could see were orange clothes, grey beards, and huge lamps burning dangerously. Shiv and his family would join that soon. They were tired, the travel had been horrible. 

They had reached Delhi by a 2-day train journey. From there, a van had brought them to Haradwar. The driver had gotten on the wrong side of Appa, which wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t much of a surprise. Asshole drivers and angry dads are a part of life. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just how it is. 

They had fought throughout the journey. Amma never said anything, neither did the boys. They always just sat there, embarrassed of their father and wishing he would stop. But they wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say that to him. They wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dare. 

Sarath had glued his eyes on the window and pretended he was flying along the van, across the mountains‚Ä¶ Shiv had the toy his uncle had given him before the trip: a tiny, shiny blue disc. It was new, so he liked it a lot.  Some richer kids, who had also come in the same van, had been sitting opposite shiv and playing on their touch screen mobiles. Shiv had felt like they were looking at him, his toy and his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s angry, broken hindi, going ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>*hmph‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>* and gleefully rolling their eyes. Shiv had had a sudden urge to not play with the toy anymore. He had put it inside Sarath‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bag and had looked outside the window for the rest of the journey- flying along the van, across the mountain‚Ä¶ 

*** 

They were about to leave from the hotel and cross the bridge to join the orange crowd for the Pooja. Sarath had his camera and sling-bag around his neck. Shiv had already checked twice to see if his toy was still in the bag. It was. He wore the new kurta which Amma saved for special occasions. It was six in the evening but the sun was still glaring down. Sarath wore his shades; shiv wore his cooling glass. 

The bridge, which was relatively empty until then, suddenly became packed with people. It was like walking inside a crowded local-train in north India. People talking loudly in a variety of languages (which all sounded like Hindi to shiv) were squeezing past each other. 

A row of rugged-looking older men decorated the sides of the bridge. Their thick, long hair and beard looked like they had never touched water. Their red eyes (which had lost badly to the dark bags under them) were staring at shiv from under the shadows. They puffed out thick swirls of smoke that seemed to push Amma closer to Appa, lower her gaze, and adjust her saree. Sarath would grip his bag and camera tightly. Appa would grasp shiv‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand. These were holy men. They were close to god. Om nama shivaya. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just how it is. 

They hurried across to the river bank and joined a crowd so vicious it put the bridge to shame. The locals cut through the crowd like sharks while the tourist fishes wondered why they chose to come here in the first place. Appa was looking at one of those bearded god men; this one looked elder than most. He was chanting loudly and throwing viboothi at a small kid who was lying on the ground in front of him. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Om nama shivaya.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Shiv noticed that the kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face was sort of twisted and his body was deformed. He seemed to be twitching involuntarily. A man, probably his father, stood next to the disabled kid, his head bent in reverence to the god man. 

Appa scoffed at them and rolled his eyes- ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>*hmph‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>* He said. ‚ÄoeHow could people believe such things?‚Äù  Then the Ganga-aarti began. Appa joined his hands, closed his eyes and said ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Om nama shivaya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. How indeed. 

Shiv‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tiny frame was squished and pushed around by the mob, which was compressing its way closer to the river, closer to god, closer to a better angle for their holiday pictures. The night sky was lit by the Aarti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s flame and invaded often by the flash of cameras. Shiv was panicking and tugging his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pants. The current of the mob tore him away from his father. Amma and Sarath were slightly behind, he swam against the crowd and reached them. Amma opened her eyes for a second, pulled him closer, and went back to praying. God must love all the attention- shiv thought. 

His parents weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always so religious. Amma had done her masters in math but had to work in insurance for a while to make ends meet. A while‚Ä¶ Then husband came, dreams went. Kids came, job went. School came, kids went. Some people like to read when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re free, some watch TV, some pray to god. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just how it is. Appa was going to retire in a few years. Om nama shivaya. An idle mind isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just the devil‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s workshop. 

Sarath pulled shiv close to him and Amma tried calling out to Appa. As the sun decided to call it a day, the tides of the orange sea turned violent. The river, meanwhile, was still flowing like it always did, not giving a damn. The family turned back and made their way towards the bridge. 

A sudden rush of young men tore apart the two kids from their parents, like a swift blade cutting through cloth. The wave knocked Sarath down and when he got back up Shiv noticed that his bag had a gaping slit at the bottom, as if a swift blade had cut through the cloth.

Om nama shivaya! 

Rudra was staring as the old man lifted his hand up and flung the Viboothi all over his son. The kid was on the floor, coughing uncontrollably, but Rudra didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t try to help him. The kid was a curse. They never took the effort to name him. Rudra just calls him Munna.  On the god man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s orders Rudra lifted Munna and dipped him in the river. In a month, the god man had told him, Munna would be able to dip himself into the river, and walk, and talk, and dance like Shiva himself. 

The kid was a curse. Rudra had been dealt a bad hand. He was told that going to Ganga and pleasing Shiva would turn this lousy hand into a royal flush. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait for munna to walk. Om nama shivaya. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait to take him back home and show him to that woman. That wretched whore who gave birth to this curse. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait to spitefully spit on her face. 

Rudra had wedded and bedded the woman in lust which had masqueraded as love. The curse had come along in a year and the woman had walked out, blaming Rudra*.  The curse came from you, Rudra. Just look at you*. Rudra was not the ideal man. Dark and frail, with an incriminating limp, this insect of a man knew that what she had said was true. She spat on his face. Moreover munna looked like rudra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lame uncle. *The curse runs in the family*, she had said. And out she had walked. 

A few people had taken pity in Rudra. They had told him to take the kid to Haradwar, and god may lift the curse. He had no choice, they told him. He had thanked them and turned away so that they can laugh, with precious pity of course, behind his back. He had left his village with a few clothes, all of his money and little Munna. 

They had taken the train to Haradwar. Rudra had lifted Munna and placed him on the seat. An old man sitting next to them changed seats and covered his mouth with his kerchief. Rudra had to clean Munna‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wet pants midway through the journey. A boy, the same age as him, had sniggered at them. The boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother had chided him, but then Rudra knew he saw her bite her lips to suppress a smile. *Not my child, Hah. * 

Rudra had walked down the station, feeling a thousand eyes burning into him, viewing his curse as their blessing. God will take care. Om nama shivaya. He had gripped his money bag tightly and doubled his pace. 

Things were going to change.

*Do not tell Appa * 

Sarath had instructed Shiv as he hid the torn bag behind his back and told his parents they were going to get something to eat. They were asked to get back to the hotel in half an hour. Once their parents were out of sight, Sarath looked at the bag again. No wallet, no camera and to shiv‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dismay, no toy. Sarath was fidgeting in frustration and fear. He screamed at shiv ‚Ä" *It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s your fault. *Shiv just cried. Then sarath decided they would rather find the thief than admit this to Appa. He knew Appa would scream at him ‚Ä" *It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s* *your* *fault*. 

The two of them walked back to the river bank and looked around. Everyone looked familiar; no one looked familiar. Sarath knew he could never identify the thief but refused to admit that. They walked around asking strangers if they saw a camera or a wallet. Shiv had stopped asking about the toy after Sarath yelled at him a second time. An hour passed. No toy. 

The two of them had searched their way to the market place. They were glued to each other. Everyone looked like a thief, like a fraud holding a blade, waiting to cut their bags. Scary movies about strangers kidnapping young boys and turning them into professional beggars were flashing in Shiv‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind. He started begging Sarath to take them back to the hotel. Sarath was debating which outcome was worse. Beggars wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get yelled by their dads‚Ä¶. Good sense prevailed and he turned back and started towards the hotel. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when shiv noticed it: At the other end of the market road a thin, filthy man was carrying a disabled kid; and in the kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hands- a tiny shiny blue disc. 

*** 

Things were going to change. 

Rudra was carrying Munna back across the bridge. He still couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t walk but God would work his magic soon. Rudra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bag was empty now, he had just enough money to get back home. If you wanted to exchange your poor hand for better cards, you obviously had to pay some price. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just how it is. 

As Rudra walked through the market carrying Munna, an old man coming towards them steered away, covering his mouth. Things were going to change, weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they? Rudra noticed a small boy sitting in a road-side restaurant with his mother. Were they laughing at us? Things were supposed to change! He hurried along the river, feeling a thousand eyes burning into him ‚Ä" schadenfreude. Things had not changed. Om nama shivaya? Why me? 

Rudra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s self-pity weighed him down and brought him to a screeching halt. He cursed at his curse- Munna was blissfully ignorant of his own predicament. He was reaching out to a toy on the road side shop. Rudra slapped his hand. Munna didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand what he had done wrong. Rudra looked at him and then at the toy. *How much? * He asked. Munna reached further and grabbed the disc. Without waiting for a reply Rudra threw the rest of the money on the floor, lifted Munna up, and walked towards the river. 

A thousand eyes bore into him. Laughing. Pitying. Two boys were following him, calling out loudly in a language he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand. Why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they leave us alone? He frowned at them and hurried away into the thick crowd near the riverbank. How fast the river flowed! He stood amidst the crowd and closed his eyes. His cards flashed in his mind. 

It was a bad hand. I give up.  I fold. 

*** 

The two brothers rushed in pursuit of the thief. Appa had warned them of slum kids pretending to be disabled to guilt trip people. Those *scoundrels. * The man had seen them and rushed away. Shiv automatically closed his eyes and prayed to a god he had no idea about. Om nama shivaya. 

They reached the river bank and lost sight of the man and his kid. It was getting late, the sun was busy snoring, and nightmares were being made. Shiv decided that he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want the toy so badly after all. He just wanted to get back home.  Sarath, filled with a rebellious foolishness that teenagers call courage, decided he would rather get crushed by the mob than hear Appa say ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>*I told you so‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>*. He pushed on. 

A hand pulled Sarath from behind. It was Amma. She jerked them out of the crowd and slapped Sarath hard on his face. Her eyes were red with anger but devoid of tears. Shiv was wincing in pain from his mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s iron grip. Sarath looked up, one hand on his bright red cheek, eyes searching for Appa. He found him standing a few steps behind them. He didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dare look at his face. 

He waited for the slap that would color his other cheek. He waited for a blasting that would last for days. He waited, but it never came. He looked up at his father to find the tears that were missing from Amma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face. They shared a look of mutual defeat. Neither won this time. 

The family was oblivious to the mob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sudden agitation. Except Shiv, that is. Shiv was silently looking at the crowd exclaim and point at the river. He followed their fingers and spotted it- His tiny, shiny blue disc. 

The holy river of Ganga. Shiv remembered what Appa had said about it-‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a dirty river filled with old clothes and dead people‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ashes‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAnd dead bodies.‚Äù
