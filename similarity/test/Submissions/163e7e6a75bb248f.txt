*Nial's eyes shone with goodness; not that she had ever found herself in their vicinity, but she still knew. She'd also never heard his voice. But she knew that he could possibly never utter anything obscene or cheap, like every other boy she had heard in their college. She knew that this boy was different, and that she was in love with him. A love that was as indescribable as it was obvious. As long as he was around, the love was enough. It set her apart. It set him apart.The evenings he traveled back home from his hostel room though, turned out to be difficult. It was one thing to have him occupy the private spaces of her mind where she called the shots. But to be aware of his presence in the closed confines of the bus meant she could notice his slight smiles from the corner of her eyes, or his brownish black hair swept back onto its own thickness, or the way he looked straight out of the window with his head held perfectly still. And each of these sightings filled her up with such unexpected joy, with such longing, that when he'd at last get off his seat and then out of the bus, she'd feel her heart sink into a pit of loss so strong, she'd have to hold her breath to stop herself from doing something silly like crying.Even as all the other boys around him made sure to expose everything that made them ordinary and everything else that did not, he stayed like a wall, impermeable, barely letting her glimpse into his world. Her only avenues remained his friends, who often spoke about him as if Nial were a prop to enable conversations with girls who like her were interested in knowing more about him. "Nial could be a monk. He knows exactly what he wants even if it may not be right now, but hey, he isn't 20 yet, and there is plenty of time left". "Of course all girls like Nial, but he doesn't like any of them back." This last bit she knew could have been meant to dissuade the girls, to make them aware of how they would never have a chance with Nial, and so would be better off accepting the interests of boys who were less monkish, and less in tune with what they wanted out of their lives. She liked listening to these tales. They seemed to carve in so much insight and yet seemed to mark out what she thought she already knew. These nights were also the most beautiful, for her dreams acquired a form that made reality seem redundant.Sometimes though, Nial's proximity to his friends bothered her, for she was hardly as blessed as he seemed to be. She found it increasingly difficult to make new friends in the college, and her interactions with everyone stayed limited to exchanging of notes and other matters that made the arduous engineering journey a little more bearable. She wished she would share the euphoria with someone. She wished she could employ a close confidante's help in boldly imagining a future, for sometimes it was all painfully lonely. Her parents would never understand, and frankly she did not want them to understand. They were made of a different metal. Their role in her life was different. The very fact that they managed to make her semester fees ready every month and then also spare her daily pocket money to ensure she traveled well, ate well and on occasions even drank bottles of soda well, was for now sufficient for the ecosystem of her family to persist. What she really missed was a decent conversation where she could just express the turmoil inside her head. She had tried writing a diary, but the experience had been singularly predictable. There was no validation of anything, for anything. Nial cruelly continued to persist in her life and her thoughts, his visits in the bus as regular as clockwork. By now, she remembered all his shirts, she remembered the exact manner in which he'd lift himself off the seat and then walk towards the door. She could easily recollect the sweep of his hair everytime he stepped off the bus and got on the road. So much trivia made her feel like she was being bound into a cosmic connection with him, because she could barely remember what his friends wore, or where they got down. With her second year in college closing a quarter, she had begun to feel an anxiety that was now terrifying as well. And so, one evening she decided she would spare herself some of that anxiety. She'd skip her regular bus, wait for the next in line. In avoiding him, she would subvert the not-so-subtle hints her mind was laying out for her. She decided to spend time loitering around the bus stand, a task that didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t seem entirely unpleasant.The exact location of the bus stand had been a mess a while back and so she decided to walk around it, make sense of this place she saw everyday and yet barely registered. She stopped by the xerox shop, forced herself to xerox some pages of the new Data structures text book even if she was certain she would never get around to reading them. The sodawala now seated in an empty shop watched her in hopes of earning a customer. She longed for a lime soda too, but already overrunning her quota of 2 for the week, she could no longer afford the indulgence. So she left that area and took a stroll along the adjoining street. For a while the unfamiliar act relaxed her, and she reminded herself she was still 18, even if 18 indicated an abrupt entry into an adulthood that still felt forced. But her parents were in their 40s, all her teachers were clearly above 30. These were the people with complicated lives. At least yet, her life was not meant to accommodate matters that she could not fully fathom. Slightly at ease, she looked past the small stores, their owners enjoying a brief lull before the returning-to-home customers would make small pit stops to the shops. She thought she would not mind a life of that nature, even if at times she could not wait to get away from this very sheltered existence. She brushed aside the contrasting thoughts, worried that they would yet again leave her only more bothered about the complicated person she was growing into.The bus had turned out to be later than usual, even if the afternoon had fully given way to a more calming evening. She touched her neck and realized she was no longer sweating. Maybe now on she would spend some time in the library and switch to this bus for good. But when the bus arrived, she wasn't so certain. The conductor was a gutkha chewing fellow who seemed the kind of trouble that would always insist on the exact fare. The seats in the bus were torn in most places and the floor littered with ancient kachra like peanut shells and dried orange peels. She picked up a seat in the second row, dreading the mosquitoes that would eventually make themselves visible through the journey and then as an afterthought buried both her arms under her backpack. The window seat offered no solace as she realized how depressing the surroundings were around her. She closed her eyes and recollected the visuals from a Yash Chopra movie. She wasn't certain if it was Switzerland or Scotland, but the place had seemed like a dream. She held onto the image as if in desperation, but was instantly interrupted when she realized somebody had occupied the seat next to her. Despite the lull of the dream that would give way to a sound sleep, her eyes were the first to open, and for many years after that evening she often saw herself wondering if her life would have turned out to be different if she had left her eyes closed after all.For a second, she was certain she was in the midst of another dream. She turned her head slightly to catch a better glimpse and then instantly sprung back towards the window. It is him! It is him, her mind seemed to be screaming. She pulled out her hands from under the backpack, foolishly touched her hair to ensure there were no flyaway strands, and then realizing what she was doing put them back under the backpack. Nial seemed to hardly notice any of this. He sat like a 'gentleman', ensuring that he was comfortable in his place and yet making sure that she had her side of the seat exclusively left to herself. His head she could see through her side glance was still perfectly held, and there was nothing in his poise that suggested he had recognized her or even if he did, he intended to acknowledge that recognition. And yet she could not stop herself from wondering how he had picked this particular seat despite the rest of the bus being largely unoccupied. That had to mean something, did it not?Soon she had begun fidgeting with her fingers, and then as if stuck by a brilliant idea, she pulled open the zipper of her backpack and pulled out a file which had a logo of their college placed right in its center. He had to spot the logo and maybe that would give way to a conversation. But some more minutes with the file sitting on her lap in various closed and open positions later, Nial's neck stayed remarkably straight, not once concerned with or interested in the movement around him. She gave up at last and stuffed the file back into the backpack. There was nothing more left to do than to close her eyes and rest the back of her head against the seat. At least sleep would have mercy on her for a while. But sleep as if winking at her state of mind, completely eluded her, and the journey preceded with the tiny gap in between them continuing to thrive.But even this proximity she soon discovered was filling her up with hope, and a strange form of desire. It only meant that anything was possible despite her attempts. She'd avoided the earlier bus precisely because she expected to avoid Nial. And yet here he was now, in the same bus, sitting right next to her, with absolutely no contribution from her side. She shifted, but slightly away from the window. The gap reduced a little. She could almost feel a part of her forearm brushing against Nial's sleeve. She felt a flutter of excitement as she let her feet spread out and then instantly pulled them back together. Nial's sleeve though was stubbornly brushing against her skin every time the bus driver managed to brake or change gears or even slow down. She stole a glance at the sleeve and was surprised to find that some of the stitches were loose. Her own mother would never let her leave the house with such loose stitches. She felt at once protective and jealous of Nial.She stayed seated in the same position for the rest of the journey, even as the right side of her back had begun to get extremely uncomfortable and her left knee had to be raised at a level higher than the right one. She was vaguely aware of this discomfort, but was also more than aware of the approaching distance. Nial's stop was just a couple of minutes away and her coincidence was now coming to an end. She slid closer to the window again and pulled her backpack closer to her chest. Nial on the other side had begun to gather his bag and his jacket. Any second from now, he'd stand up, and in his place, one of the three men standing next to their seat would sit down next to her. Her arm would brush against these men now, and if they were anything like the perverts she often encountered on these journeys, there would be more of them that would brush against her too. The thought at once disgusted and depressed her. She wished she could stop Nial from leaving. She wished she could tell him...tell him what. As he stood up and one of the three men positioned himself to occupy the vacant seat, she realized she had nothing to tell him. There were no words, just the smoke inside her head. But as Nial reached the bus's exit and the man sat down next to her, something inside her snapped. She stood up too, pushed past the man next to her, completely ignoring how he had refused to pull his legs back in letting her pass. The bus conductor looked at her in a funny manner, as if he was privy to her secret. She ignored him too and followed Nial out of the bus.Nial had not noticed her, and she made sure he would not, as she maintained a careful distance from him, even as her eyes were fixed on his back. Every few seconds, she let herself take in the sights of this small town she had never visited before. She was amazed by the wideness of the open space. The few houses she encountered on the road also possessed a quaint design. This is the kind of Goa that must fascinate tourists, she decided. And she could not deny she was mildly fascinated too. Her parents who were born and raised in the neighboring state of Karnataka had no opinion of Goa beyond it being their workplace. Her father moved here when he was 20 and after a series of odd jobs found his calling in driving a rickshaw that he lovingly named "Vijay Deewar" after his favorite movie character Vijay from the movie Deewar. His life revolved around more mundane things like survival and ensuring his wife and daughter were well fed. Of course, there was the occasional indulgence in the form of expensive whiskey that she had often seen him drink, much to the chagrin of her mother. Her mother she found more interesting in comparison. The woman had once dreamt of being an actress! But then had resigned to her fate and accepted marriage with a rickshaw driver and yet as her father often liked to say, "made his life". If the woman was not her mother, she'd even be mildly in awe of her efficiency, of how she refused to look back at her life with any kind of regret. What she felt for these two people, she could never tell.She sighed as she turned to look back at Nial and realized with a shock that she had lost him. Stuck in the middle of a road, in a town she barely knew, she was even more shocked by her own stupidity. What was she even trying to achieve by setting on this journey? And how was she going to get back home? She desperately fished into her money purse to count the number of coins. 10 rupees, but would that be enough? She decided to turn back just then when she noticed even through the dull dusk coated evening, Nial emerging out of an adjoining lane. He had resumed his walk along the road now. She fidgeted with the straps of her backpack, as if her life depended on them. She let go off the straps and as if convincing herself, she stepped ahead. Nial walked for a long time, or were those merely a few minutes she would never be able to tell. Now refusing to look away from him, she noticed many things that she had never noticed before. Like how he did not wear shoes, but sandals that exposed the backs of his feet, how his legs were much longer than the rest of his torso, or how his walk was slightly stilted, like he wasn't really interested in lifting his feet one after the other. By now her own feet had begun to tire and for her sake, she wished he would stop walking, and as if he'd read her thoughts, he stopped.The very first thing she noticed about his house was its size. With two large floors and a huge porch where two dogs lied down with what seemed like casual nonchalance. There were no people around even if the front door was open. She watched all of  it like it were a scene from a movie, only mildly aware of the darkness settling around her. It made utmost sense to head back home and remind herself of her inherent stupidity, and yet as she saw Nial stopping by the dogs and then patting their bodies, one by one, she felt a form of happiness she had never known herself capable of experiencing. She stood right there, watching him put his bag down and let the two dogs throw themselves on his body, a smile beginning to form on her face, till one of the dogs spotted her and just as quickly took her to task for intruding into its personal space.It was too late to turn around by the time Nial spotted her. She could barely make sense of the expression on his face, but she saw his hands move down to the two dogs, and his mouth utter something that instantly calmed them. And then with a slow measured stride, he walked towards her. When he stopped a few steps away from her, the evening had completely dissolved. Her eyes were focused on her own nails desperately in need of a trim. "Do you have any work here?" Nial asked in a voice that took her by surprise. It was nothing like what she had expected, and yet not entirely unpleasant. "Do you need to see someone here?" This time she lifted her eyes up, despite herself beginning to be scared of him and everything around him. And yet a part of her was sad that his face or his tone seemingly showed no recognition of her. The sadness of this realization brought her close to tears, and she looked away to make sure she could reign in that urge. "Wait a minute. Are you... You study in CE college right? I think I have seen you in the bus sometimes too." For a second, she wanted to celebrate the moment. He had seen her, and more importantly seen her enough to notice her. She turned her head to tell him that, yes, she studied in the same college, was junior to him by a year, and that she liked him enough to want to follow him to this unknown place, with just 10 rupees in his purse and all kinds of fears; but her eyes could only settle down on his face, for she was suddenly very very tired, and his face seemed as inscrutable as the Bengali movies she tried watching without reading the English subtitles on Doordarshan on lazy Sunday afternoons. "I need to get to the bus stop. I think I am lost," she said at last, her eyes still stuck on his face and yet not registering it. Nial seemed unconvinced, but he moved closer to her and then stretched his hand to tell her how she was to turn around and walk straight till she would come across a dairy booth where she would have to turn right, walk straight, and then take a second left turn which would take her to the highway. He stopped here and lowered his head to ask her where she was headed. She almost mumbled, "Vasco", but then quickly said "Margao", even as her direction challenged mind wondered if the route even made any sense. Nial seemed to consider that inside his head too, for she watched him scrunch his eyes in a manner that suggested something like pensiveness. "Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>d still need to cross the road, take a bus to Cortalim and then take one more bus to Margao," he said at last, and then added, "hope you know that," as an afterthought. She nodded, and then with a passing glance at his dogs who were back to a position of casual nonchalance, walked away from there. It was after she'd taken a few steps that she realized she had not thanked him. She turned around instantly to notice that Nial had turned back and was walking towards the door. "Thank you," she said in a voice loud enough for him to turn back. "Thank you," she said once again, and he waved back.*
