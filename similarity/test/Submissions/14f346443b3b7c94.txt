The Hospital 

Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Sunday. Medics are on leave since a week. There is a whirlwind of chaos running through the premises, the floor and beds, all mixed up, three on a bed, thousands on the floor, brawls, cries, whispers, groans, one with blood oozing profusely from his neck, the other lands his feet on a needle, dogs smell through the wards, one dead, lies flat, white, mouth wide open, legs frozen facing ceiling, stench creeps through the floor and the smell takes in every one. Nobody comes out alive from the hospital. The young, the infant, the toddler, the elder, everyone dies. 

Maiara lifting her hands up and down, slithering them on the iron grills running adjacent to her bed, cowering in the linen and whimpering. Mahavara, the people are suffering, that old woman, her swollen legs. Look at the man glued to bed from a week, he defecates on his bed. They will recover. I will pray for them. I will make it; itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a mild cough. 

Maiara, A graveyard, it is. The smell, mesh wires, manholes, fans circling at snailâ€<sup>TM</sup>s pace. Look at the dilapidated windows, look at the glass, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all broken. The man on bed 17 died yesterday, the other guy is drinking all day, other vomits on his bed, and the other has worms crawling over his body, he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t feel anything, he says somebody is digging nails in his head, he cries abuses. Smell the stink, hear the cries, look at the ashen faces, nobody visits them. They have lost hope. Look at him, bed 18, the dead, his entrails, the flies, blood oozing, sores on his thighs. They are just dying. That old woman is always mumbling. She is cheerful, hopeful of living one more day. Her grandson must be visiting her anytime. The man on the wheel chair. He stares at everybody, laughs at the very first sight and then cries whole day. He eats the leftovers from the dust bin. Look at the street dogs licking blood in wards. The other dog, limping. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s dark and humid. The walls are haunting; gloom and darkness has descended on this place, death is knocking on the doors. I have my fears, everyone is dying. I saw the other hospital, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s different. 

Mahavara, the hospital will shift me to a new ward, they promised. Cool breeze runs through that ward. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a garden there, flowers, good food and coffee. People are not allowed to vomit there. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s clean and lively. They will shift me. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a mild cough. Mahavara, see the twinkle on my face, look at the mole on my neck. 

Nobody is allowed to even saunter around those wards, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s for medics. The other guy just collapsed. He is shivering on his lips. He has gone mad. He speaks a different language. He says somebody dragged him; somebody smashed his head with a hammer. He can't walk his life time. He has fits all day. He has no one to visit him. The other people, they are offering Goodbyes, prayers, they come and go. 

Mahavara, look at the henna on my hands and your name in the center, MH. The bangles you bought for me, the green and red ones, anklets and the sound they make, those love sounds, the kohl in my eyes,  took me an hour, smeared my face as well. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m growing weak. I love you; what about this shiver that crushes my spine? Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m withering, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m melting. Let's make love here, kiss me, kiss on the mole at my neck, caress me. You love the mole. Kiss my tender neck. I have lost my color, skin and bones; face disfigured, fissured, wrinkled, I have lost my sheen, look at my fingers, bony, the nails deformed, discolored, my dried lips, thousand sighs, saliva runs out of my mouth, I will recover, I will polish my nails, I will dress like a bride, I will look beautiful, the same. You love the mole on my neck, kiss it, run your hands over my face, hug me, kiss me on my shoulders, kiss my eyelashes, smell my hair, let me bury in you. 

Maiara, you saw that man, untidy, with bag full of lighters and matchstick boxes. He empties his bag in the middle of the ward and places all the things in symmetry. The other man with him is worn out, famished with beard mounting over his face, he is naked, half covered. The lighter man spits all the time. He has bread and bananas, he offers it to everyone. He spits on his hands and then massages his head with the saliva. He spits in every corner of the hospital. He is ugly. He searches for something in his hands, in the lines, between the lines of his hand, at the top of his hand; there is black mud. He runs his hand over his head, back and forth, stares, collects the sweat on the tip of his finger and throws it on the other guy. Everyone passes him. He has a whistle tied to his neck; he blows it all night through the wards. The other guy is busy mincing leaves in his hands, some herbs. He puts the mixture, pellets, in a leaf coiled over and takes deep puffs. He wakes up in night, drenched in sweat, claps at all the patients in the hospital, reads hymns and blesses patients. He coughs blood and phlegm. Maiara, this is a hospital. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m quailing, let me cry on your lap, I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t see this pain around me, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s heartrending. I have sea of tears in my eyes, they will dry, let them come out. 

My heart is sinking, you hear the beats and my racing pulses. I can't sleep in the night. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s such pain, the pain of isolation and solitude. You live through my dreams. I die through my dreams. My blood has clogged in veins. My heart has stopped beating. I will die of clogged blood. Someone comes in from the door. The wait has ended. The one I waited for all these years. The door brushes the floor; i speed through and fall on my face. It was a dream. Someone opens the door every day. I don't move. I wait all night. The door brushes the floor. I hear sounds, distant cries, my heart sinks, and the beat reaches to my throat and shifts back to my head. There is a lump in my throat. I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t breathe. My heart stops beating. I swallow the beat. I taste death. People are dying in dreams, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a plague. 

Maiara had fever and was admitted to Hospital at the town. She died after 6 months of her admission. Her body wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t handed over to Mahavara as he suffered nervous breakdown. The body was given to the department concerning chest diseases and was further used to remove her viscera to find the cause of her death. The doctors at the department observed that she died from pneumonia and the extended study will help them in finding cure against this new lung ailment. Mahavara turned mad and moved around the hospital for years. He was admitted to the department for the cure of mental diseases of the hospital where he was kept under observation. The medics observed that he turned violent at times and would slap himself all day and night. He stayed in the hospital for three years and died mysteriously. His body was found in abandoned rooms, a month after. People say that he guided a needle into his heart to slow down the racing pulses, twisted the needle many a times in rage, he bled to death. In the following days, the medics operated on him and took his brains out. People say that his skull and brain were dried for days, preserved in some blue liquid and kept in hospital museum. His body was given to the anatomy section for conducting different experiments. The medics observed that Mahavaraâ€<sup>TM</sup>s body and brain will help them solve the hidden mysteries of human evolution and that this research will help them find new capsules and liquids for patients with mental diseases. 

Mahavara often shared anecdotes with neighbors: She was with her friend walking right in front of me in the vegetable market right across the canal. I moved hurriedly and took hold of her hands, asking to stop. She recognized me, we greeted each other. The twinkle in her eyes and the mole on her neck, it was all same. She was the only girl I ever loved in my life. I wasted no time and asked for her companionship and love, I was too fast to ask if she could marry me? She stood surprised and said: I can't love or kiss; I can't marry but only be friends. Her words betrayed her heart, she was concealing her love. I held her hands tight and moved swiftly along the road leaving her friend behind. Her pointed nose and the sweat packed in a pearl rolled over. Something came upon us and drove us mad. We smiled and laughed our hearts out. I looked at her and she looked at me. I could have died for her that time. I was breathless, I needed her, I was confused, I was taken over, I went sleepless for nights. It was a dream. We ran and ran. We hugged and hugged. We kissed each other passionately; I kissed her nose, cheeks and her hands. Melancholia and the canal bank, we dropped our feet in the cold stream of water coming from a far off river, looking at each other with wet eyes and those copious tears were flowing like a stream of river, never ebbing. She hugged me; I hugged her, we sat for hours looking at each other. It was such joy.  There was so much to talk about, all those years and the longing. The friendship blossomed each day; love grew more and thus came the ceremony of being together for the entire life. I liked everything about her. 

He would go on continuing and praising her love: â€<sup>~</sup>The creams, talcum, braids, gestures, movement of eyes, fragrance, creases, face, the glint, lips, feet, nails, the hair, curly, brown and dense, the well crafted nose.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

There was only love. The neighbors were also fond of them. He worked in the parcel department of the town. The staff at the department was all praises for Mahavara. He was honest, punctual and hardworking. 

It was much love between the two that didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hold them far from each other for even a single day. They would miss each other every second and all day. They thanked almighty for giving them everything, the bread, land, grains, job and love. Love songs bathed their days and nights. Life was simple and so much filled with love. 

For the first few days after the death of his wife, Mahavara warned people to take the other road that is at a distance from that hospital. He would tell them to veil their faces when they moved across the hospital. He narrated them â€<sup>~</sup>Thousand Sighsâ€<sup>TM</sup> every day in the morning, he spoke of life. He repeated these lines all day. He ran through the road, looking at the sky, throwing water, grains and dried vegetables. He turned mad. 

Thousand Sighs 

A single hour and thousand sighs, The day, Every day, A void and the sound, the sound of air, supple black fingers and fluffy cotton skin,  skin, mottled, the clots, blue, red, black and grey, A single hour and thousand thighs, What do you think of this life? What is life? Those midnight yearnings and dreary silences, the separation, the shrieks, Animals howling on streets, The vapid movements, Bone dry limbs, Gargantuan belly, Bloated Belly, Bone Belly, Varicose Veins and the pallor, Sky and its dullness, Drooping eyelids, The color of hair, What is Life? Macerated lung, Diseased Kidney, Ruptured Heart, Half Liver, What is Life? Swelled parched tongue, Spinal puncture, the cracks, Saliva bubbles at edges, Mushroom fingers, Fluids, Pus, The dementia and longing for dead. What is Life? Life is Death, Extended death. A stone in mouth, Worms crawling viscera, poison and blood. A single hour and thousand sighs, what is Life? thrombosisrrests, cancertrokes, cystsiver, kidneyeart, crohngauchermarfan, gravescadcopd, wilsondercum, downsickle, spinalolon. What is Life? Thousand Sighs and Death. 

The hospital had a sly populace running the affairs. It was located in a desert land and was surrounded by few shops. One of the shops was of tea vendor, the other selling white linen sheets, and the other few medicines. There was one butcher shop as well. The medicine shop was the oldest of them all. The shop owner had a ghostly appearance, with one eye bulging out of his eyelid. He laughed at all the customers and scolded them many a times. At times he didn't give them medicines, instead he asked them to sit and listen to his past stories. In his stories, he would often glorify himself and his shop, he would talk of his father, grandfather and great grandfather, and how they saved lives of many people by giving them their home made magic capsules, some 50 years ago. 

The hospital had few medics who looked after the patients. The month of summer had thousands of patients swarming the hospital. Winter and rains eased the rush. Hospital building was colored once when it was made some 100 years back; it was on decay now, the structure crumbling. The wards were painted black and yellow, the doors heavy with iron grills. Patients were seen sitting on the pavements in and outside the hospital holding fluid bags in their hands. Some had pipes running down their mouths and noses, some wore white clothes stained black on the collars and some had green shirts stained purple. 

Patients with fractured bones were shifted to rooms carved out in the underground parking spaces. Patients with pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses were kept in sealed halls devoid of fresh air. Light of any form was not allowed, black painted the glasses and doors, the ceiling was wrapped with plastic sheets and the windows shut for 22 hours a day. Patients survived a day or two and were then moved to the 4th floor mortuary where they were packed in wooden boxes infested with fleas and centipedes, later dispatched to the families by the hospital van. The hospital van had a loud siren to be heard from miles. Before the van reached, the families would gather on roads, welcoming the dead by slapping their faces and chest, hammering their heads on the stones and street road, shouting in the skies and calling the dead. 

Mahavara described hospital as a place of death.  He made interesting revelations about the hospital. He would often sit in the middle of road, calling his neighbors and telling them stories about the hospital. He would tell them about the corpses lying naked in the wards, the faces they wore, dead hanging with the fans, the machines, peelers, boiled water and the blood. People never took him serious. He closed his eyes in the middle of conversation and would talk about those days when Maiara was admitted in the hospital. Mahavara carried a little diary with notes written all over it. It was about the hospital and treatment. It read: 

The hospital had ropes tied to fans where the patients were hanged in mid-night to assess and evaluate their health. If patients resisted the hanging or moved their feet and body; they were released and given proper medication, many of them dying after few seconds of hanging, most of them too frail to brave it. 

For people wanting voluntary death, they had skin peeling machines that would crawl over the patientâ€<sup>TM</sup>s body and pierce their skins to remove it out. It would take whole day for the skin to come out, after that the vessels were punctured with syringe needles and blood collected in bowls was thrown in drains running parallel to premises. The organs were tested and kept in labs and the remaining flesh with legs, hands, bones and skull was sold to nearby butcher shop. 

For patients with no symptoms of disease, they had fire producing machines in the wards, leaving patients charred to death. For people with mild symptoms, they had bottles of saline and glucose, and injections filled with poison. The cancer centre kept patients with 1st stage malignant tumors under quarantine for 6 months, after which they were given chemo shots for 3rd stage malignancy. Patients died after a year of quarantine and treatment. The cancer center had large audio boxes and loudspeakers for notifying the patients about their disease and the precautions that must be followed with utmost care as to how much daily water and food they must take, the amount of proteins and calories and other dietary supplements. The patients at the cancer center were given the same diet as supplied to the General ward. Boiled water with sugar syrup and salt was often supplemented with garlic paste to complete the dietary requirements of cancer patients. The fluids were supplied through large black pipes perforated at the ends with large nozzles; fluid was sprayed at every patient bed. 

Hospital staff was allotted an abuse chart and a regular duty of half an hour in the evenings and mornings. The duty consisted hurling abuses at the patients (duration: 10 minutes), depriving them of  dietary supplements, offering special prayers (prayers of death) (5 minutes), narrating death stories (10 minutes) and sneering at the patients (5 minutes). The chart was to be followed strictly. 

The air pipes at the patient beds were supplied with black gases coming from the hospital kitchen. The air when inhaled smothered patients to death. It was one of those easy procedures followed by the hospital to ease pain. The hospital entrance had blood spattered on the sides and edges, on the stretchers, covering over, giving it a grotesque appearance. Most patients admitted to the hospital fainted to death at the very entrance of hospital. 

Hospital had a trolley for keeping biscuits, bread, eggs and other eatables for the staff. Eggs and breads were given to medics to keep them sturdy and healthy, the biscuits to the rats around the beddings and in the drains. Patients were given fluids made of salt and water; the water was boiled and supplied through pipes when hot. It nourished the patients and provided them the required minerals and salts. The fluids were supplied six times in a day each lasting for one hour. Everyday patients figured bloated bellies, swelled hands and legs, faces marking a forlorn appearance. Patients complained all day to medics about their deteriorating health and were often given adrenaline doses. 

The blood banking facility was under construction all time. Dust and smoke filled the air. The rooms were all occupied with broken chairs and tables, cobwebs lined up the wooden benches, small black rat pellets marked the corners. Donors were seated on wooden benches with their heads wrapped in polythene sheets and needles inserted in both the hands to draw blood in rusted iron containers marked with hospital symbol, the skull. The blood transfusion facility was all dark with small blue tinted bulbs on the floor giving it a bar like appearance. The staff sported black goggles with male members having large beard and hospital symbol on their faces. The donors were given black viscous sugary syrup drawn from the earthen vessels at the exit of the facility. Summers were dreary, filled with sweat and shrieks. Patients wiped their sweat and drank it drop by drop. Each day, corpses were lined up in hospital lobby and waiting rooms, tagged meticulously with hospital MRD Nos. and wrapped in white sheets, then handed over to the relatives. 

Mahavara heard that the other hospital infused life in the dead. Medics worked day and night treating the patients. There were lights and skyscrapers, hospitals at the very cliff touching skies, elevators of glass from all sides of the buildings carrying patients in and out of the wards. The patients wore clean tidy purple aprons and gloves with face covered by protective gears. The hospital had filters fitted on the ceilings, at the doors, in the windows, clearing air of dust. The staff greeted every patient, wishing them good health in an enigmatic manner. The wards were colored crystal white, appearing lively. The beds worked on their own, digitized and connected to life saving machines which worked day and night. It was all life. People like Mahavara were not allowed to even sniff the air around the hospital; they were scoffed off and despised upon. The hospital staff guarded the building along a wide perimeter. Half of the perimeter was lined up with wires having live current in nights. Most of the staff guarding the hospital was sported with guns and pistols. Dogs if seen pestering around were shot at legs. Mahavara often saw people laughing at the exit gate of the hospital. Mahavara confused this with a dream, he dreamt of carrying Maiara on his shoulders to the city hospital where she was rested on an automatic stretcher carrying her to the ward at the top through elevators. His Maiara gets well in a day or two, hospital car drops them home and both live happily. He waited all day outside the hospital hearing abuses from the staff. Mahavara had nowhere to go, he clung his hope to the hospital, dreaming all time. He waited and waited. The wait never ended. 

The hospital premise at the town was turned into a large facility with multiple insulated wards in the basement and mortuary. The counselor over the years allotted more funds for revamping the entire functioning of the hospital. He took several measures that saw huge amount of money being allotted to hospital. Over the years, various regulatory committees were formed and funds were allocated to the town hospital to make it more viable and life saving for patients of the town. The counselor took serious concern of the increased mortality rate and discussed it with the medics and senior officials over the years. The hospital saw more funds allotted to it for successive years. The funds were well used by the counselor to set up improved medical facilities for the patients. The water soup nutrition was increased from six to eight times a day, the manual health determining system was replaced with automated hanging machines, automated skin peelers were introduced, hospital vans equipped with multiple sirens and color system were introduced, improved therapy system for cancer patients was inducted with quarantine time increased to one year, blood transfusion facility was upgraded to the standards of city hospital and the patients often contracted multiple diseases after transfusion, sanitation facilities were improved and bathroom fluids were often seen seeping through hospital wards, walls and patient beddings. One of the most important developments was the construction of grief rooms where people were allowed to cry, slap their faces, call the dead and even stay for a night longer. In the follow up meetings of the hospital board, counselor did put up a proposal for installing a series of electric crematoriums  for each department as people had to go long distances to do the last rites. People took it as a blessing from the counselor. 

The town hospital minted two coins after the names of Maiara and Mahavara, used for registering patients admitted in the hospital. People of the town and in the neighborhood praised the authorities of the hospital for offering such respect to the names of both. The counselor and the medics were the most respected people in the town after the coin thing started in hospital.
