The Motorbike - Gita Jayaraj 

Muthu sat on the dirty floor at the juvenile detention centre. He could feel the swollen welts of fingers on his cheek. The humiliation of that first stinging slap by the traffic constable played over and over in his mind. The soles of his feet were raw. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been beaten with some kind of a stick and later a wire. The blood from his cut lip was crusted and he could feel his left eye had already swollen so he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see much out of it. His whole body felt raw. There were other boys in the small room. They didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look much better either. Some cowered and others sat with blank expressions. One or two of them were biting back sobs. A really small boy, perhaps 10 or 12, sat retching air in one corner. Each in a private world of pain. By now his grandmother must believe that he'd run away from home as he had often threatened to. She must have woken up earlier in the day and wondered why he had not returned with the parcel of pongal for breakfast that they usually shared. It was almost evening. She must be waiting, hungry, unless the neighbour's daughter, Shanthi, had come by to check on her and had given her something to eat. He sighed. Everything had gone as planned that morning and then there was this bike! 

*** 

Muthu stood up slowly stretching. It was 4:30 in the morning. His bones creaked and his body ached and his eyes were all gummed up. Last night's heat had been unbearable. He rolled up the worn out straw mat around the sweat-stained flat pillow. It was still a bit damp and there were new shiny patterns like a slug had crawled over it. He must have drooled as usual in his sleep. Carefully he tucked away his bedding under the string cot where his old grandmother slept. The strings were sagging so low that she might as well have been lying down next to him on the floor. The bed barely cleared the floor by a few inches and his rolled up mat and pillow fit in that space providing some support and bedding for his sleeping grandmother. He listened to her snoring and wheezing alternately as he slowly dragged himself outside. 

He tipped some tooth powder onto his left palm. His right index finger served as toothbrush. Toothbrushes and toothpaste simply didn't work for him.  He wandered back inside grimacing at the tiny mirror as he brushed. The he turned around and watched his grandmother as she slept.  She was so thin and emaciated that in that light she could be mistaken for a child. Her mouth was open. Her shrunken stomach rose as she inhaled and her lips fluttered noisily as she exhaled. Wheeze, snore, wheeze, snore‚Ä¶. It was an urgent rhythm that she kept. One that seemed to have so much purpose since it was one of the few activities that she was capable of without assistance. Even in this moment of sleep her breathing was purposeful. 

He'd have to hurry if he were to make it to the temple in time. He quickly finished brushing, went back outside to the single bucket of water they had filled up from the tap at the end of the street and used a few mug fulls to wash his hands, feet and face. Then he carefully took some water and spread it over his hair combed it into place and changed into a clean shirt. It was relatively clean although it was frayed a bit around the collars and the hem. A not very crisp but clean dhoti and he was ready. 

Today he would go to the big Pullayar temple, opposite the bus depot.  He registered absently the early morning sounds as he walked down the street. Cycle bells of boys delivering milk and newspapers. Strains of what he thought of as brahmin music came from some of the houses. As he turned off into the main road, he walked a little more briskly. He had to reach and stake out the place before he could begin work. He'd already stopped by the previous day to check all the entry and exit points, the size of the temple, the average time a person needed to pray and circumambulate before getting back and out. And the possible places where they would leave their footwear. 

He stayed a little away from the hustle and bustle right outside the temple gate. He kept out of sight of the flower and fruit and betel nut sellers. He did not want to draw attention to himself. Anyway, he was just barely more than a boy and most people in and around temples did not pay much attention to young boys.  As he waited and watched, he was surprised at how many people preferred to leave their footwear unguarded than to part with a meager two rupees that the shopkeepers charged to keep them safe. 

Muthu waited, watched and then swung into action. He'd already left a huge empty plastic sack in a dustbin around the corner the previous evening. He'd only pick up slippers that were common and not too fancy or expensive; those that he could sell. The fancy ones would not have any buyers in the places that he sold them. His method was simple. He would unobtrusively watch people who left their slippers closest to the entrance and those who left it the farthest.  He'd follow one of them and pretend to pray. As he watched the devotee go further into the temple, he'd come out casually wear the pair closest to the entrance and pick up those furthest away and dump them in the sack.  In a few minutes he'd repeat this maneuver again. It went fast and after he'd collected enough pairs, he decided that it would fetch him at least five to six hundred rupees and he decided that it was enough for today. Each would sell for between Rs. 75 - Rs. 150 if he cleaned them up a bit and polished them. He even had regular customers who placed orders for specific kind of footwear with sizes. 

It was as he walked towards the dustbin to pick up the sack with his loot, he saw a brand new motorbike parked on the side of the road. The keys were still in the ignition. Thinking that the owner must be somewhere close he let his eyes wander to look for possible owners. But there was no one. The shopkeepers were busy too. The temple was packed and no one had yet noticed any missing footwear. 

Muthu would have walked on but the possibility of a taking the bike on a spin was far too tempting. Nonchalantly, Muthu picked up his sack, flicked his dhoti up and knotted it around his thigh. He climbed on to the bike. It was brand new. She started at the first kick. He rolled her out of there slowly and unobtrusively. In a little while, he was out on the open road, he raised her a bit. She purred and he smiled, pleased. He opened her up slowly till she was humming at a steady 80. The wind hit his face and his eyes smarted but the exhilaration was worth it. He'd get himself a bike like this, he promised himself. And he'd take Shanthi out on it. Shanthi, the neighbour's daughter. Her father and mother both owned a little cart where they ironed clothes. Her mother collected clothes and delivered them back after ironing while her father ironed them. Since they were out most of the time except when her mother came home briefly to pack lunch that Shanthi had cooked for herself and her husband. Shanthi would finish cooking breakfast and lunch and bring a little over for his grandmother and spend some time sitting and talking to the old lady. He watched her as she sat there talking about random things or passing on some gossip. He rarely participated in these conversations but she would occasionally shoot him a glance when she felt his eyes on her for too long and he'd look away quickly, blushing. 

She was older than him by several years. Somehow he never had noticed that. And as far as he was concerned, it made no difference. She was his. 

Lost in pleasant reveries about Shanti, Muthu barely noticed that the traffic police on the side of the road waving him down. Panic hit him. He'd never till now had any run-ins with the police and he wanted to keep it that way. He pretended to slow down and just as he neared the temporary check post, he raised the accelerator and sped away. 

*** 

Traffic constable Jayapandi saw the young boy on the brand new bike speed away and completely lost his head. 

The morning had not started out well for him. His wife, Sumathi, had found out about Nandini, whom he'd been seeing regularly for the past two years. He wondered how she could have known. He's been so careful, not even his closest friend, Krishnan knew about it.  As the accusations rose to a crescendo, and the sounds in the kitchen assumed violent proportions, Jayapandi grew quieter and quieter and went about his morning ablutions and silently let himself out of the house without breakfast. He knew he'd have to face her wrath soon but he was not ready for it yet this morning. Soon the absence of breakfast and waiting to check for motorbike riders without helmets in the hot May morning sun began to have its effect - he had a blinding headache and the shimmering tar road that he was staring into didn't really help. Now this young chit of a boy giving him the slip right under his nose was the last straw! He whipped out his radio and barked into it describing the bike and rider and gave his colleague at the next point the number of the bike. 

*** 

Although Muthu had sped away, his stomach was twisted in knots at the thought of being caught with a borrowed bike (he could not admit to himself that it would be considered stolen) and his loot of chappals. He'd only wanted a ride! He meant to return the bike but the chappals would tell a different story! His mind was racing furiously as he thought about what to do. He was entering a slightly crowded part of the highway. It seemed that he was entering a small village or town. He decided he'd pretend to stop for breakfast and then leave the bike outside and quietly slip away. The more he thought about it the more he liked the idea. 

As he entered the little town, he noticed several roadside eateries. Good! First he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d need to find one that let him go inside and eat and then when done ignore the bike and slip away in a bus. Lakshmi Vilas said a small board. This looked just right. 

He parked the bike outside and went in and ordered some pongal-vadai and a coffee. An unnecessary expense he thought. Then he went and washed his hands at the discolored basin. He left his sack of chappals near his chair on the floor. The scrawny boy-waiter in a dirty veshti brought him a steaming hot plate of Pongal with a single piece of vadai. It smelt good. As he ate, he began to feel that it would all turn out alright when the veshti-clad boy waiter called out to him, ‚ÄoeSaar can you please move your bike to one side? The tempo delivering vegetables has come.‚Äù 

Cursing under his breath, Muthu slowly got up and headed towards the entrance and moved the bike to one side. The boy came and stood looking at it admiringly and full of longing! ‚ÄoePudhu vandiyaa?‚Äù(new bike?) he asked. 

Muthu nodded with a tight smile. ‚ÄoeNalla irukku! Enna mileage tharuthu?‚Äù (Very nice, How much mileage does it give you?) 

‚ÄoeInime otta, otta thaan theriyum,‚Äù (It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll become clearer as I ride it more) he replied and went back quickly inside to finish his breakfast and pay and leave. That put an end to his plan to leave the bike behind. The boy would be able to identify him even before he got a bus to get out of there and would call him back! 

As he wracked his brains in desperation about what he could possibly do instead, he decided to sell off the bike. He had to do that soon. He was not sure if the policeman was chasing him or if an alert had been sent to the next check post. He'd never sold a bike before and now he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d to try and get rid of a stolen one. He'd no idea what to do. 

*** 

Jayapandi was getting impatient. He wanted to make someone pay for his lousy morning and this boy who had refused to slow down, he wanted to get his hands on him! He wondered why it was taking so long for Sami at the next checkpost. He called him on the radio. ‚ÄoeWhat happened? Where‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our man?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄoeHe hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t reached here yet, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m waiting for him. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll call you Jaya as soon as I get him,‚Äù replied Sami. Jayapandi grunted as he switched off his wireless and squinted into the distanceon the blinding road! 

His mind went back to the morning. Sumathi! Oh God! He wondered for the hundredth time how she had found out. She wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bad wife, he thought sighing. But he was just no longer interested. For all the togetherness they seemed to share, neither was she. She was always busy: either in the kitchen or washing clothes or sewing buttons and hemming edges of something or other. By the time she finished for the day and came to bed, she was so exhausted that she straight away slipped into deep sleep, snoring softly as her stomach rose keeping rhythm. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember the last time he had taken her in his arms or even wanted to. Their life together carried on mechanically. There was nothing else. No children. She had her work at home and a walk to the temple with a couple of the neighbours‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> wives. Her life was self-contained and complete. He thought about Nandini and his expression softened. Nandini, tall, brownish yellow skin, and softly curved at the waist and hips. She smelt good ‚Ä" turmeric, talcum powder and jasmine flowers. For him, it was heady combination and these days a whiff of this smell anywhere would make him long to head back to her. 

Absently he picked up the wireless transmitter as he registered its crackling. He sighed deeply and answered. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d found and apprehended the man. But he looked more like a boy. The voice at the other end sounded puzzled but the bike number matched he said and the boy carried a bundle of used slippers. It took Jaypandi several seconds to understand what he was hearing. He was still surfacing from Nandini‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s embrace. 

*** 

Muthu felt the tears start even before he registered the sting of a slap across his face. His cheek tingled and his face turned crimson with rage and shame. He looked at the angry traffic policemen glowering at him. A small crowd had gathered. He saw the boy who had served him breakfast at Lakshmi Vilas looking at him wide-eyed. To avoid further physical abuse and shame he quietly admitted to having taken the bike for a ride. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d meant to return it he said but the slippers in the sack proved difficult to explain and they sealed his fate. There was a lot of commotion around him and he was whisked away to the nearest police check post. The bike was left with another traffic policeman who would probably trace the owner and return it. By now a complaint must surely have been registered. 

*** 

At the check post, they took down details, name - Muthumaari, age - 16, address. He lied about his address. He didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want his grandmother or Shanti to find out. He told them he lived with his sister and brother-in-law and gave the police their address. At least that much was true. There was a sister and brother-in-law although they were estranged and did not visit Muthu or his grandmother. The policemen traced the brother-in-law who disclaimed any knowledge or responsibility. 

He was brought to the juvenile home and left in the custody of two men. There was some conversation between the policeman who had slapped him and these men ‚Ä" he made out some words of the conversation, words like stolen bike and chappals, confession. Then Jayapandi left. The frustration seemed to drain away from his face. He looked calmer, almost satisfied. 

Muthu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ordeal began with Jayapandi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exit. After several rounds of being beaten and kicked during which he had confessed, over and over, to having stolen everything they found on him, the guards stopped and left him alone for a while. 

He sat desultorily, thinking about the how the day had panned out, about his grandmother and Shanthi. 

A little later one of them returned and ordered Muthu to follow him. Mutely, he scuffled behind the guard. They stopped outside the bathroom. ‚ÄoeGo inside and wait,‚Äù he ordered. Muthu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s knees began to tremble. He could only guess at what was to follow. He stood holding on to the doorjamb. The guard kicked him in. He went almost sprawling in. Even as he tried to recover balance, he noticed huddled on the floor, a battered, bruised, body that was barely breathing. Muthu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s insides heaved and as he sank to the floor. Shanthi! he thought‚Ä¶
