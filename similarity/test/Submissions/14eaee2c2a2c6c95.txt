The Story of a Sidekick 

/* Following is an excerpt from a 15 year old's daily diary. */ 

Date : 25/6/2002, Wednesday 

Dear Diary, 

The day began with the usual mamma scream "Utho Rohan subah ke 6 baj rahe hai! School jaana hai ya nahi?". She asks this as if I have an option. Getting up at 6 is tougher than playing Contra at level 6. Even tougher when the school has just started and the weather outside is almost commanding you to cuddle inside the blanket. Even more tougher when my dad keeps snoring at the adjoining bed. What kind of sorcery is this God? He gets to wear different clothes, he goes to office when he wishes, he comes when he wishes, he earns money, he spends money and he snores at 6. I hate early mornings. I hate my school. In that order. 

My school is quite far from home. And that is the only thing I like about it. I get to ride my Hero Cycle for long and witness the whole town wake up along with the journey. Next year, when I will be in some big shot city college, the only thing I will miss is, this journey. Seeing the doodhwaala stack up his racks, the paanwaala set up his thela, the paperwaala race along with me (I sometimes want to mimic the paperwala and throw my school bag in some building like a newspaper :D), the fresh air hitting your face. Everything's refreshing! All's great up to the point my school's hoarding is distantly visible. St. Aloysius Primary and Secondary School. Then all these good things die a tragic death in my brain and some new things emerge. Incomplete homework, didn't bring History textbook, forgot to cut the nails, have Miss. Mathews' Period today. Ohh god! End my SSC already! 

Miss. Mathews hit me today. Again. Don't know what she has against me. Why did she hit, you ask?. Wait till you hear the reason. Just because I pronounced 'bathing' as 'baatHing' and not 'beding'. Who says 'beding' in real life anyway! In real life what you face about 'bathing' is, "Jaldi nahaakar aao warna us Video Game ko aaj masale k saath silouti me kut dugi!". Miss Mathews should understand that the class has girls. You don't hit a boy in front of girls. That is the universal rule! You destroy his manliness if you physically harm him in front of a girl. Not that I have a girlfriend in my class. But still. My friends believe Miss. Mathews is going through a bad marriage and I look like her husband. 

Coming back to girls. I know I look average. I am not good in studies. I am just a boy who likes to cycle every morning. And sadly, morning-cycling is not a quality that would sway girls off their feet. So in short dear Diary, I like almost any and every girl out there. My type? Any girl who's ready. 

When I came back home today, I was very tired. The travel, studies, homework, evening cricket, Miss. Mathews bashing and its resultant humiliation had taken a toll on the body. Even Boost, the secret of Tendulkar's energy is not being able to keep up with me it seems. 

I was having the evening tea when Shyam my neighborhood friend came running and shouted "Hey Rohan, jaldi bahaar aa!". Shyam is always too excited. The first of many signs of he being dumb. But he is well-built and takes my side whenever there's a cricket fight. So, he is my best friend forever. Yes diary, go ahead, call me a mean selfish prick. Better to be virtually spineless than to be actually toothless. The moment I came in our verandah, he grabbed my arm and took me outside. Our new neighbors had come. Shifting their belongings. That big truck with all the furniture stuffed in. Workers taking out Sofa, Almira, Bed, Fridge, TV. One by one. I love this shifting thing. Moving and rearranging your everything. Has to be so exciting! Shyam nudged me hard, "Ha!.. ab waha dekh" he pointed his finger just to the left of truck. 

A girl emerged from behind. Carrying a container full of books. Wearing a beautifully carved salwar kameez. Curly hair. Dusky complexion. Big, wait no, Huge eyes! My type you ask? Ask her!! I am ready to marry her, have kids with her, go to the god-damn Chaar-Dhaam with her!! "Dekha? kya maal hai yaar! Bas decide ho gaya! Yahi meri votti banegi! Nikhil ko bol diyo. Uski hamesha se dadagiri rehti hai" And I shoved my dreams off the cliff called Reality Falls. Still, I couldn't take my eyes off her. She kept going in, coming out, ferrying her luggage. I wondered what her name would be. Dreamgirl felt right, but it was highly unlikely. The whole evening whizzed past by. 

When I came back inside, Parents were talking with Arjun on our brand new Beetel Landline phone. He had won some Chess championship it seems. My perfect elder IITian brother. Parents can't stop gushing about him. A day might just pass without the earth rotating but it would never pass without someone lecturing me "Bade hokar Bhaiyya jaise banana hai ki nahi?". Anyway, He is the "Wo Sharmaji ke beta pata hai?" for every failure around here. He is the Harry Potter of this house and I am his Muggle brother Dudley. 

I cannot stop thinking about my new neighbor girl. But I need to. I have to stick to the thumb-rule of my life. 'Be Practical!' Of course a Shyam or a Nikhil would get her. Meri kismat me koi Miss. Mathews hi likhi hai. I cannot ever forget that I am supposed to play a side-kick in my life movie. I am supposed to help get Hero the girl. Sidekicks are named as such for a reason. They get kicks not girls. 

Its getting late now. I should sleep. Tomorrow is a very busy day. Havent done my homework. So an inevitable action sequence with Miss Mathews awaits. Group meet of society boys on who between Nikhil and Shyam tries on the new girl. Feeling sad about me? Welcome to life, dear Diary. 'Sadness' is just another synonym of 'Reality' that Thesaurus forgot to mention. 

Good night!

Dear Diary, 

OKAY SO, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!! 13 frigging years and you are still here!! I was trying to find my old pic to whatsapp someone and I find you!! And I just read this last page. Ohh Diary, there's so much to tell you! So first, just let me back up a bit... 

I don't remember whether Miss. Mathews hit me the next day as well. After so many years, you tend to forget the routine occurrences. We did have the meeting after school. Nikhil being already committed, Shyam was chosen unanimously for Kiran. Yes, we knew the girl's name by then. Our spy-friend Ravi had gotten us all the vital information. Name Kiran. Class Xth. Army Colonel Father. House-Wife mother. Now she being my BFF's potential girlfriend, I tried picturing her as my Bhabhi. Felt nauseating. Adding salt on the wounds, she was my new classmate. She even came over at my place once. Asking me to lend her my notebooks so she could complete her missed chapters. We spoke. Mostly she did. I just stared. Stared at the thrill of being with her. Stared at the disappointment of not being with her. They call it Crush for a reason. Its supposed to be crushed. 

Next sunday, as planned by the team, we all hid behind a temple as Shyam stopped Kiran on her way back from school. We could hardly see their expressions from that far. Moments later Shyam cam running back, "Dont know what happened! She just left. Shy, Scared. Dont know." he gasped and excitedly we went back to play cricket. The light had dimmed, our tired legs were crawling back with our cycles. As soon as we entered the society, we started hearing noises. Entering the lane the noises became sharper and louder. Kiran's mother was shouting breathlessly in front of Shyam's Verandah. Big-big altercation was going on between both families. "Apne bete ko samjhao, warna agli baar police complaint kar dege". "Ha ha kardo complaint hum bhi dekhte hai kaun kya ukhaad leta hai". After a thunderous pointless quarrel, Kiran's mother left, howling,  "Kaisi mawaalio waali society me aa gaye hai. Pehle hi kaha tha inko". What pursued later was what we all had anticipated. Shyam was beaten by his dad left, right and center. Bamboo Stick, belt, shoes, chappals, bare hands. Everything was used. All of us ran back inside our homes like mice hurrying back to their holes. 

What a day it was! After a while though, the tension slowly eased up. Society got back to normalcy. I forgot to meet you that day and somehow I misplaced you. Also, we had our Xth going on. So with time, our studies got better of us. Kiran was never stared at again. Nobody could ever really forget the Shyam bashing. The year ended. I managed to score decent enough marks. My big city college dream was probably feasible now. Kiran was sent to her Uncle's at Pune for higher studies. I headed for mumbai. I never saw her again. 

.            Now, let me tell you what I have been up to all these years. After going to Mumbai I didn't look back. I graduated from a reputed Engineering college. Got placed in an MNC. Went to Italy for MS after 2 years. Came back last month. You must be feeling proud! Dont. This was an achievement 12 years ago. Now everyone is doing this. So, chill. I was still that side-kick! You need proof? I had been single throughout. And I am 28 now. Convinced? Now, lets move ahead. Bhaiyya got married and settled in US. Dad retired last year and we are now settled in Pune. You know diary, any Indian man earning a salary in his late twenties is surrounded all over by Indian Cupids. Indian Cupids you see, are your elder relatives who at any cost want you to marry someone. Anyone. I am the honeycomb right now. Parents had been relentless over this last month. Also, I needed to get married. As you know, I am no Hrithik Roshan. And age wasnt helping the cause. I knew what I deserved. I needed to find my Miss. Mathews. 

So last Sunday, I agreed to meet a girl my parents chose through some marriage portal. Cafe Sancho's was chosen to be the Rendezvous place. The girl I was supposed to meet was a working woman. Age - 28. Perfect I thought. If you are not married till 28, one big probability is that you are unmarriageable. Good. So, I have a chance. I reached the place 15 minutes early. If you lack in some qualities, you try to make up for them in others. At least be Punctual, I thought. I took a sip of water as I google searched on my smartphone, "how to initiate a conversation with girls". Nothing good came up. Everything was artificial. One liners. One liners don't go well with bland faces and zero confidence. It was almost time. I was really scared now. If I was honest with myself, I was no good for any girl. Certainly not a Sales Executive Girl. Certainly not a Sales Executive Girl who's named Kiran. Yes, her name was Kiran. One of the primary reasons I agreed to meet her. No, I did not hope it to be her. I knew *that* Kiran would be married by now to some army Brigadier/Colonel stud. 

I emptied my 5th glass of water as she entered the cafe. And just like I felt right now. On finding you. I felt then. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! It was her. It was Kiran. I froze like a glacier and a Titanic just grilled past me. I ran to the washroom. Immediately I called my parents, "Aapne muze bataya kyu nahi ye wahi Kiran hai hamare gaao waali?". Mom said cheerfully, "Are ha wo to mai batana hi bhul gayi. Muze laga tuze yaad bhi nahi hoga ab tak. Tu mil liya? Phone to de bahu ko!" "Bahu? Maa mai usse mila bhi nahi hu ab tak" "Ohh achha, mile to mera aashirwad dena use. Chal rakhti hu inko khaana paros rahi hu". I just kept looking at myself in the mirror. It felt as if my chest wont be able to hold my heartbeats any longer. I hurriedly combed my hair again. Cursed myself on forgetting to apply the Deo. I went out. She was sitting at the table we had booked. Looking outside. Waiting for me. She looked more beautiful than ever before. No way she was saying yes to me. Maybe her parents also forced her to come. Maybe she has a BF her parents disapprove of. 

And before I knew I was at the table. "Hi" I mumbled. "Ohh hi!" she jumped. "Hello Rohan! So long its been! How are you?? Business Analyst and all huh?" She laughed. I died. "Haha yeah. Following the lane as always. Everybody is doing the same these days" I said. "Hmm but still. It takes Talent and Hard Work to reach where you are! Look at me! Did MBA from a local college. Now earning pennies." "Hmm" I replied. I just could not get over the pain of losing her all over again. I was going to explode. "Will you marry me?" I said before I could think. Shit. I thought. Game Over. "Whoa! That was quick! Ok. So, most probably yes I will. But let me at least make sure that you are the same Rohan you were 13 years ago." And I thought. 'Oh my God! This girl liked how I was 13 years ago. I am most probably going mad now. But then, my thumb-rule. Oh please thumb-rule, go to hell. I am getting my Dreamgirl here. Phew. I need to calm down first. What did I find in that Google search? Make the conversation happy and light. Then you can move towards being slightly flirtatious. Ok Super Mario. Lets get the Princess.' 

"Did you just flirt with me?" I humored. "Hehehe no! But I really liked how you were back then. Sincere, Focussed, calm, kind. I knew how other boys looked at me. You never stared that way." she smiled. "Or maybe you never noticed" I smiled back. And she blushed. And I died again. "So, why wait till now? And seriously why put up your profile on a marriage portal?" I asked. "Hahaha profile was put up by parents after I rejected some 20 other men for arrange marriage" "Ohh!! 20??" "Yes. I dint want to marry then. I wanted to make something of myself first. To earn enough. I am still not there. But when they told me about you I agreed. How could I let someone like you slip right?" she chuckled. "Ok. Now this definitely was a flirt! You have told about this meeting to your parents right? I don't want to end up like Shyam by the end of this conversation!" "Oh god! Dont embarrass me! That was really not needed! My mammi is over-protective. I was so sorry for what happened." "Haha its ok. He needed that lesson. What was he thinking stopping you on the middle of the road like that!" "Hmm" she replied. And I built the first pillar of my relationship on a lie. Time flew by. We discussed about our families, careers, aspirations, dreams, past, future, life. We were saying bye-byes to each other when she said, "You havent changed Mr. Sharma!" I quickly replied, "Was that a Yes to my earlier question in the Sales Executive language?". "I will get back to you on that" she laughed and vanished in her auto. 

I kept standing there smiling like an idiot. We have been talking over phones since then. Sometimes we start chatting late night and in a few moments suddenly we notice the sun coming up. Life is beautiful Diary. I am marrying my first crush. Today she asked me to whatsapp her one of my old pics from our town. And that's when I found you. Dear Diary, I want to tell you what I realized through this. I realized that nobody here is a side-kick. Not always anyway. There will always be moments when you get the opportunity to play a Hero. Sometimes you grab them. Sometimes they grab you. I realized that although, 'Being Practical' is safe. It limits your chances. You might breathe being practical. You live, when you dream. Believing in an impossible might make you sad some days. Most of the days. But that one day when that impossible happens. That one day makes your life worthwhile. 

Ok, I need to get going now. Need to whatsapp that pic to my fiancée : ) 

Good Night!
