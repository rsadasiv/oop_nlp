The writer is a Syrian Christian Malayali born in Delhi.   She graduated from St. Stephen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s College and took a Post Graduate degree from the Delhi University.  While in the University, she cleared the Civil Services and joined the Government of India in 1989.  She ploughs through the memories of her childhood, Delhi of 70s and 80s, to write stories of ordinary women and their ordinary lives.  She hopes that the stories, written with honesty, will find resonance among her readers. 


*Wiped Clean* 

When I came home that evening, weary and hungry, worried that I was late, Mummy who would normally be waiting at the door for me, was sprawled on the kitchen floor. Empty *dabbas* (re-used jam bottles) were lying soaked in a tub full of soapy, grimy water. The masalas from the *dabbas* had been emptied on newspapers, arranged on the dining table.  Fresh newspapers spread neatly to fit the queer-sized ledges. Mummy had pulled up her sari to her waist in war-like readiness with only the *pallu* left free to wipe her sweating face. 

She looked up briefly only to mutter ‚Äoethis house is so dirty, nothing can make it presentable!‚Äù 

I was hungry.  But I knew better than to ask her for food.  Wednesdays were the days of practicals‚Ä¶ long hours spent peering at unrelenting test tubes.  Normally, she would have made hot steaming rice with chutney. Small pieces of onion chafed with chilly powder, curry leaves, a small lump of tamarind, a dash of coconut oil and salt to make mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s special, flaming hot red chutney.  She would wait with her eyes on the rickety gate.  On spotting me, she would place the *tawa* on the burner, ready to whip me an omelette.  I would hurry to wash my hands, splash water on my face and settle to eat this spread.  Then we would settle into the routine, ‚Äoetoday, the lab assistant made mistakes with the salts and‚Ä¶.‚Äù 

That was an ordinary Wednesday.  But today was different.  She was busy and in no mood to follow our routine. 

‚ÄoeThere is some *roti *in the fridge‚Ä¶ some *subzi*‚Ä¶ just help yourself‚Äù, she said. 

Grudgingly, I followed her orders and then asked her ‚ÄoeWho is coming?‚Äù 

Struggling to stand up, straightening her tired feet, she said ‚Äoe Kunjumol is coming with her family‚Äù. 

‚ÄoeWhen?‚Äù, I asked 

‚ÄoeOn 25th.  That is only 10 days from now.  She is already in Bangalore. She will come here on her way to France‚Äù, she said 

I should have known.  It had to be someone from her family. 

Our little house was the pit stop for caravans of malayalis looking to fly overseas. They could be anyone‚Ä¶ an aunt, a neighbour of an aunt, the aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brother-in-law‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s second cousin‚Ä¶.. Families could come in and stay for undisclosed periods. It was understood that we would keep our doors open; there was no place for gratitude or insouciance in the act, rewards of which came in implicit promise of reciprocity; grace finely ingrained, not apparently visible and yet reflected in the bearing of the guests and the host family. 

Mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family was different. We were expected to bow to the exacting standards of cleanliness that characterized her family.  It was not that their own homes were visions of ‚ÄoeVim‚Äù-ly sparkle; these standards were what they expected of others. 

As guests, my parents were self-effacing, afraid of treading on others‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> toes, of causing inconvenience of any sort.  But Mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s relatives were different.  *Arappu*[1] was their touchstone; they could smell out the sources of *Arappu*; they accepted you only after *arappu* was banished on and around you. 

Cleanliness‚Ä¶ of our house, our kitchen, the upholstery, the toilet, of our bodies, our towels‚Ä¶ there was not an item of the household or our person that did not have to go through the purification ritual that the momentous visits of her family, demanded. 

Kunjumol was the youngest of the siblings.  The little sister, the pet of the family.  In the rare moments of spare time, Mummy would pull out old albums, point to Kunjumol in the fading photographs, ‚Äoethis was the time when Hannah was born, Kunjumol had come down to help me.‚Äù A scrawny, pale girl in long skirts and long plaits: the kunjumol of yore. 

She moved to France soon after marriage.  Mummy would normally rush to Kerala to meet Kunjumolma each time she flew down to India for vacations. But this time, she was coming here in Delhi to meet us. 

My older sister Hannah returned from the market while I was still eating. She was rarely sent on errands, that was my assigned work, but this was a special occasion. Hannah looked upto Kunjumolma as the paragon of style, beauty and class.   I could see that she was very excited about the visit. 

Two glass bottles full of yellow acid had been bought, to be poured into the toilet to get it sanitized for Kunjumolma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shining backside.  The next 10 days were spent on unending visits to shops, searching for cereals her children eat to toilet rolls (things we never used, naturally).  We had no idea what might be demanded, it was better to second guess and stock regardless. 

** 

When Kunjumolma and her brood arrived, I was at school.  I found them playing in the front lawn, two young girls, aged 10 and 15, with the stray dogs that normally hovered around the big garbage dump that lay across our backyard (separated only by a small nullah), but had today, somehow reached our gate.  Kunjumolma was rushing to get her kids off the dirty wretches, when she spotted me.  ‚Äoe*Aiyo*! This is you, Rachael?  How tall you are!‚Äù, she said, rushing forward to hug me. 

I hugged her back, tossed the hair of the 10-year old, Dia as the 15-year old, Ria looked on. Dia looked pretty in floral prints and shiny hair.  Ria was a gawky, lean girl with brooding eyes.  Kunjumolma got the kids to come back into the house (who knows what will they touch, the foolish kids). 

Mummy was in her element, cooking.  ‚ÄoeThey would stay only for two days,‚Äù mummy had said disappointed.  It was too short a window to put the world at their feet. But mummy would do her very best, rest assured. 

The first thing you noticed about Kunjumolma was that she was absolutely fair.  She perhaps did not step out in the sun, she did not need to, unlike our mother who walked an hour each way to work.  Her skin was dry, almost flaking when the creams come off. Her pale eyes, scant eyebrows, merged into the skin which made the kohl line look stark and out of context. She got saved by fulsome pink lips, the redeeming feature of her face. 

There was nothing remarkable about her, maybe that is what made her agreeable. She can look happy without smiling. It could well be the cheerful lilt to her voice.  She would crack at the smallest of jokes, there was nothing that she could not laugh at. The family legend was that even funerals elicited the same mirth in her uncontrolled disposition. 

She was one of those people who met you warmly, hugged you but had nothing to ask you.  What you did, what sort of person are you, the questions that may occur to ordinary folks, do not trouble her.  She was not a curious person, maybe kids and young adults did not interest her. 

She joined mummy in the kitchen and began to chat with her.  We tried to engage Ria in a conversation but she was shy.  Dia, on the other hand, had inherited her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s cheerful disposition.  In the living room (being the only other room than the bedroom), Daddy was silently nursing his drink with Kunjmolma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s husband, Monchayan, who towered with his imposing height even while sitting, and a dignity that wealth provides so easily. 

In between the chatter, the clank of cooking from the kitchen, Kunjumolma laid out the booty, so to speak.  There was a beautiful coat and a stole for mummy (which we would naturally usurp); a range of Clearasil products for my sister (tools to wage a war against the pimples that covered her face, a source of worry for the entire family), two pairs of jeans and a spectacle frame for me.  Besides the chocolates, cereals, neskwik...She had great taste, she gave us with love and generosity. I whispered a shy thank you.  My sister, Hannah was more effusive and relentless, eager to please Kunjumolma, ‚ÄoeOh, I love the smell of the soap.  The corduroy jeans fit me so well‚Ä¶ how did you get the size so right?‚Äù 

Mummy took out her gifts: a silk scarf each for the two girls and a khadi silk sari which my father had chosen for Kunjumolma, a beautiful peacock blue and brown combination.  Kunjumolma received the sari gracefully, ‚Äoe *achachan*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s taste is so good‚Äù she said. 

This was a little trick mummy played, every gift was given as our father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s choice so that it would be accepted without demur.  Our father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s general silence made his authority (and taste) unquestioned in the outer world. Although it did not quite work with our mother, when we were alone as a family, without guests. 

We said our evening prayers, an abridged version, which was a rare concession given to guests. We readied to help our mother lay the table for dinner. 

Our bathroom did not have a wash basin; our toilet was indian style. Kunjumolma put a bucket out in the backyard, ‚Äoelet us not spit in the bathroom, please, *aiyo, arappu*!‚Äù she said. The little discomforts for which compromising solutions could be found.  While she spoke to her husband in French, perhaps commiserating on the discomfort. 

She gave instructions to her kids in French and after a long time spent on strange ablutions, we sat down for dinner. 

She pulled out a bottle of mineral water for her family, ‚Äoethey always fall sick in india, it is the water that does not suit them‚Äù, she said. 

Mummy coaxed the family to eat. But they took a piece of bread and tiny portion of a chicken curry and refused to touch anything else.  ‚ÄoeOh, we are so tired, amma, can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t eat.  Why did you make so much?‚Äù she asked mummy helplessly. 

Mummy hid the disappointment and cleared the plates as I was just readying for the feast.  ‚ÄoeTake rest, *molle*[2]‚Äù, mummy told her sister, ‚ÄoeI will manage‚Äù. 

But my aunt heard none of it and together we cleaned the table.  The kitchen did not have a sink, the plates had to be washed squatting on your haunches on the floor, this was not something Kunjumolma clearly could not be allowed to do, so we left the kitchen as mummy washed the dishes alone. 

There was only one bedroom in the house which was cleared for my aunt and her family.  We slept on the floor, mattresses adjusted cleverly. Daddy, however, was spared of the ordeal. 

As we lay down, mummy was worried if they would all be comfortable on one bed but‚Ä¶.‚Äùhope they like the *chole bature* I have planned for breakfast‚Äù she muttered. 

It was a Sunday and we got ready for the Church.  We were woken up early, our clothes had been kept out the night before so that we could get ready without entering our room, which was now theirs.  Mummy had stepped out after a bath when Kunjumolma woke up.  She fidgeted with the tea that mummy had prepared for her, left the pretence finally and got up to make a cup for herself and her husband.  They did not like mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s milky tea, it was too sweet. 

‚Äoe*Molle*, feel free, make it your way. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know how you make it‚Äù, mummy said indulgently. 

Mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s curly hair had become scant.  She collected her fallen hair to make small buns which she fitted into the shape of an 8, each day.  After a liberal round of coconut oil to douse her wild hair, she combed vigorously and tied the bun.  She did not even need a mirror.  It was perfect, maybe out of sheer practice. 

While drinking tea, Kunjumolma watched mummy, laughing at the routine, so old-fashioned. 

Hannah piped in, ‚ÄoeI keep telling her to junk this and go for a loose bun that is far more elegant, like yours Kunjumolma, but she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree‚Äù. 

Mummy refused to laugh and gently reminded Kunjumolma ‚Äoeyou taught me this bun, *molle*, do you remember?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBut that was years back, mummy, really, you must change and why do you put so much of oil, it stinks‚Äù, Kunjumolma said laughing. 

‚ÄoeThis is alright for me. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to change‚Äù, mummy protested 

‚ÄoeYou can smell mummy from a distance in the church, she must be the only one who puts so much of coconut oil‚Äù, added Hannah. 

Mummy reminded us that we were running late for the church.  I had hoped that the guests would object to wasting their time in church but then I had obviously missed the point that Monchayan was one of the founding father of the Malankara Orthodox Church in Lyon; he traces his lineage to *kochukunju updeshi* and‚Ä¶.. To sum up, there was no respite from this punishment. 

But Hannah was spared.  Her periods had started a day before; the church was too holy a place to be defiled by menstruating girls. 

We hailed two cabs to go to St. Thomas Church. 

Mummy pushed a panic button regardless of how early we were, out of sheer habit.  ‚Äoe*Thubden vayichu kannum*[3]‚Äù, she was muttering amidst the many ‚Äoeaiyos‚Äù, as we climbed the steps to the back entrance of the church. 

After our offerings, mummy proudly introduced her sister to her friends, her ‚Äoe*Prarthana group*[4]‚Äù, who had all lined up to meet Kunjumolma. I saw them all smiling except Cissy aunty who did not look all that impressed, I thought. 

It took so long.  While the rest of us fidgeted, my father & I walked to fetch a cab.  Maybe it was the fear of waiting charges, because mummy jumped into the cab without much coaxing. 

It normally took us long in a bus and I had assumed that the church was far from our house.  But the cab hardly took any time. 

Back in the house, mummy quickly changed into her work clothes, made tea for my father while Kunjumolma made her own tea. 

It was already 11:00 am, this would be a brunch, I thought. As mummy got the *baturas* ready, Kunjumolma started to pick on mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friends.  Her friends were annoying, they were meddlesome, they deserved to be ridiculed.   Molly Chacko‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sari tied so high that it looked like it had flooded. Mony Varghese‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s phony smile‚Ä¶ we laughed as Kunjumolma imitated the lot.  She had a talent for mimicry and nothing ever escaped her attention, Oh, she is such a riot! 

Mummy was frying the *baturas* in the kitchen, she did not join in the conversation.  Or maybe she did not like it‚Ä¶ who knows, she was silent. 

The kids did not eat the *baturas* but Kunjumolma & Monchayan enjoyed them. 

Mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face had already lightened, the crease of worry was one, even if marginally, at least one meal had been appreciated, her sister had eaten. 

‚ÄoeIs Dia not hungry?‚Äù , mummy asked, concerned.  Without waiting for an answer, she said ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry, I have got everything ready for biryani and some cutlets.  Ria, do you like cutlets, *molle*?‚Äù asked mummy. 

While mummy washed the dishes, the sisters sat talking.  Sometimes in hushed tones, mostly cracking up, loud peals of laughter with mummy protesting ‚Äoe*aiyo, nirthadee*[5]‚Äù, because she could not laugh anymore. Kunjumolma was sitting on a *mooda* which she sidled closer to the washing area as they sat discussing some secrets.  From the corner of my eye, I watched them.  I could not imagine Hannah & I share such closeness; it made me jealous. 

I was trying to play a word game with Dia &Ria, trying not to win. ‚ÄoeI was too good at this‚Äù, I thought smugly, till they beat me.  I do not know what triggered the fight. I missed it because I had begun to concentrate in the game, trying to reduce the margins of my loss. 

But mummy could barely subdue her voice. Hannah had soiled her clothes with menstrual blood. Mummy asked her to wash her clothes and the soiled sanitary napkin immediately and not dump them in the bathroom as she did usually. 

We used old bedsheets, thinned and softened with use, as sanitary napkins. Mummy tried hard to ensure that we washed them ourselves; but when we dumped them here and there, she washed them for us, fearing infection. 

Maybe she had hoped to get Hannah to do as she was told, quietly without a fuss. But that did not happen because a quiet war was already going on between them. 

The fight was on an upcoming school trip to Jim Corbett park.  The IXth graders had planned it themselves, so it was not a school trip as Hannah had pitched it.  My parents had refused. It was not just the expense, I could gather, but something else that made my parents, especially mummy, wary of the trip. 

When the fight got louder, it was awkward. 

Our normally silent father intervened, ‚ÄoeWhere are your manners?‚Äù he asked Hannah sharply and walked away. 

Mummy got back to the kitchen, silent and angry. 

Kunjumolma tried to pacify Hannah telling her ‚Äoelet me pay for the trip. I will be so happy to do this for my niece‚Äù. 

Mummy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face darkened. But she remained silent, perhaps she did not want to sour her sister‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visit, she was our guest after all. 

But Kunjumolma was not the kind of person who understood these nuances. She was laughing, ‚ÄoeGo, I will speak to your mother‚Äù, she said to my upset sister. 

It was time for the late lunch and the sisters began to lay the table.  Dia had eaten nothing since morning and this was worrying mummy although Kunjumolma made light of it. 

Mummy insisted that they should eat first, Daddy would join them on the table, because they would have to leave in 3 hours for the airport.  I kept the plates on the table.  Kunjumolma tilted the plate to a side, peering at it closely. Mummy motioned me to bring a cloth to wipe the plates clean once again. 

I went to the bedroom and brought a cloth which I used ordinarily as my sanitary napkin. Slowly I wiped all the plates with the cloth except my father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. 

Mummy stood at the table, for a moment shocked, but no one else knew what had happened. The chatter on the food had started, the kids had reached out for bread to be had with cutlets, the bottled mineral water was poured‚Ä¶. A harmony in the routine that we had got used to in the last 2 days. 

Mummy & I went to drop them at the airport. We tried to maintain a conversation in the cab, with Monchayan taking the lead. 

At the airport, the sisters hugged each other tight till it was time to go.  Kunjumolma kept looking back to wave, smiling while fighting the tears. Mummy broke down, snuffling her cries, wiping her tears with her *pallu*. 

We took a bus on our return.  It was getting dark.  As we walked back from the bus stop to our house, I reached out my hand to mummy.  She held it tightly. 

We never spoke about my act. In hindsight, it was unnecessary, not worthy of acknowledgment or forgiveness.  It was not important.
