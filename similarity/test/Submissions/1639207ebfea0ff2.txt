Hi, I'm Mohit, an amateur author who has been wondering for a while why he likes to write. It's because writing and telling stories for me is a way to connect- to people, and places. Through your fine publication I hope to reach out, and hope someone , somewhere will connect with this story, which in itself is all about people and their strange connections. Because perhaps all that really matters is the connections we make. 

*ANOTHER LIFE* 

Pradeep had friends. He wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t talk all the time to them, or always be with them, or be involved with all of them all the time in their activities. But that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t necessary. They would let Pradeep sit among them in class, share notes with him, help him out in assignments and practicals. And that was good enough for him, he could respect that. But every once in a while during lunch all of them would be eating together and someone would say something and then all of them would laugh besides him, and he would just wish for once he could truly laugh with them. He would sometimes wish to feel truly belonging among them, rather than just being there. But perhaps he was being greedy. They shared notes, and let him sit among them, and that was enough. 

And so when the rest of his friends would go out for the weekend about the city or to nearby treks or tours ‚Ä" outings to which Pradeep rationalised he was never asked to since his friends must have figured out he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the outdoorsy kinds anyway- Pradeep would go to the local library for lengthy afternoons spent reading just about anything he could get his hands on. He would have to sit between the many racks or sometimes behind them to avoid the gaze of the librarians who never allowed anyone to just sit and read for too long, not that it was ever an inconvenience. It was better than being at home anyway. If reading was what gave Pradeep solace, his parent‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s choice activity was criticizing Pradeep. They seemed to have prepared lengthy rants on just about everything and would be set off by the smallest most unexpected things. And it always got to him, no matter how hard he tried to not let them affect him. Because they seemed to be saying just what Pradeep was thinking anyway. He was too ugly. He needed to get in shape. His prospects for marriage were poor. His GPA was poor. He should have been trying to find some internships to do. He would have difficulty trying to get a job. He was wasting away his formative years. He had wasted away his formative years, and now was also wasting away his constructive years. He was too passive, too lazy, to uninspired. 

He had no friends. 

It was thus that Pradeep stumbled across the forum. It seemed to be an obscure world of it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own, a website dedicated to a fantasy book series that Pradeep had serendipitously stumbled across one day when reading articles discussing the latest book. It seemed to be forum , a discussion and message board of sorts. It was fairly active, and seemed to be full of threads regarding all the topics he was interested and curious about. There were in depth character study threads, discussions about specific chapters, as well as general trivia regarding small details and characters. For the longest time Pradeep lurked there, here too a presence observing rather than truly participating like in real life. He seemed content to just read, go through past discussions to understand their references and in jokes and theories. Then one day he was going through a rather lengthy thread which had devolved into a passionate argument about a certain character‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s key decisions. And something in Pradeep stirred ; he felt like he had things that had to be said, whether anyone would hear them or not. Even if his post would likely get buried or go unnoticed, he had something to say that apparently no one had gleamed through these books so far and it was possible he could have been completely wrong and they would laugh him off but it didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter. And so  without thinking it through, and then overthinking it some more, Pradeep clicked on the sign up button, filled the form, chose a fictional name for himself ‚Ä" ZephyrFlame, a mystical sword of great power mentioned in the books, gave an old mostly unused email id, and set up his account. And then he made his post. And then when others commented on it, he replied back, and he engaged in a conversation with them. And just like that he was in. He was truly in, and not just standing around on the edge anymore, wading in himself rather than loitering till he was let in. 

The weekends at the library became scarce now. Whenever he did show up it was only to issue a book from the Fires of Gilmoda series ‚Ä" again, for a brief period, to find the specific reference he was looking for. In class he would be totally engrossed in his mobile now, scanning through the forums whenever he could find the time, and sometimes even sneak a peek in class. Soon he became deft at handling the forum better ‚Ä" he understood now not only the many references and in jokes they had, and the small customs and gestures this little tribe seemed to have developed for itself, but also how to use the technical features of the site better. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how he learned how to begin chatting with other users. He began making many friends. And these were his friends, Pradeep realised. They talked to him about his interests and his insecurities and about any trivial thing they felt like talking about. They shared their own life stories with him. Pradeep would thus have conversations about TV shows and movies with a comicbook store owner in Pasadena, about politics and world news with a retired teacher in Tulsa, about Mughal history with a 30 something Englishman in Liverpool, and cricket with a fellow young student in Melbourne. And it felt good. He felt for the first time like there were people who were interested in him for who he was. There was something, many things in fact, with which he could form some sort of connection with people. He loved it. He had a chance to glimpse into other lives now. And through the account, a chance to live another life too. 

There was one interaction in which Pradeep was finding himself more invested than perhaps he cared to admit. His name was LighteningLord. He seemed to be a middleaged clerk or paralegal in New Jersey, or so Pradeep had deduced based on their conversations and interactions. He was fairly active in the boards, and had been for years. He had a very deep knowledge about the lore of the books, and not just the Gilmoda series but many fantasy and science fiction books in general. He also watched a lot of TV and movies. He argued deeply about American football and American politics, and  described himself a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>foodie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. And for some curious reason he thought ZephyrFlame was a girl. How he ever came to this conclusion Pradeep wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sure. But suddenly the chats he seemed to be having with LighteningLord seemed to make sense. For the longest time, LL ‚Ä" or Pete as was his real name- had tried to hit on Pradeep. And strangely still once Pradeep realised it, he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bother to rectify Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mistake. 

At first Pradeep was merely curious. He wanted to see how far this Pete would go. Also, perhaps studying what Pete was trying to do to woo him, Pradeep could improve his own ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>game‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. Who knew, maybe the dumb American who even send him money if Pradeep manipulated him right. And so Pradeep lead him on. He told Pete his name was Varsha, he was a doctor in her thirties, lived with roommates and was still single. Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s behaviour changed considerably. If there ever was any doubt he was trying to flirt with ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Zephyr‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> before, now Pradeep knew for sure. The attempts seemed crude too, even to Pradeep ‚Ä" it seemed Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s game was no better than Pradeep‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. And this was a grown man, in America ! Pradeep couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help but role his eyes as pete tried to pass himself off as a burly and strong man, humbly brag about his physique and how good he was at his work and all the cool things he did with his friends. Even Pradeep, who would get anxious at the very thought of talking with a girl, could see through how lame Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s efforts at trying to smooth talk and flirt and compliment a woman were. 

After this chatting with Pete became an experiment of sorts with Pradeep. He had been granted a glimpse into another man in a very intimate way, and Pradeep could sympathize with what he saw. Pete was lonely. In some strange way his past hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been much different than Pradeep‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own current state. Pradeep felt bad about him, a little guilty too for deceiving Pete. But in it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own strange way, perhaps he was helping Pete out ? Just like talking to people in Tulsa and Melbourne had helped him cope with his own loneliness. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t as if Pete could be crazy enough to come to India looking for some woman he had never met or truly fall in love with her. So he would talk kindly to Pete. He would always patiently listen to his problems. Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dad had died, and there were unresolved issues between them. He was looking after his sick mom now, who had moved in with him. But people still felt he was the one who lived with his mom and people at work even made fun of him. Pradeep couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand what was so wrong about living with one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parents but these Americans ‚Ä" with their shameless drinking and doing drugs and casual sex- thought it was taboo. Pradeep spoke encouragingly to Pete. He told him to ignore the people at work and focus on taking care of his mom. Every once in a while, out of the blue, Pradeep would send him messages like  "Dear Pete, deep down, you know as well as I do that you could be a lot better off than you are if you only had someone on your side, someone who would help you, encourage you, work with you, and stick with you even when things get bad. What I'm talking about, of course, is a true friend‚Äù, and ‚ÄoeI was thinking how lucky I am that in this great, big, crazy world I found you. I hope I can be part of your life for a long time‚Äù. 

Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s responses changed. No more were there clumsy and cringey attempts at flirting, instead there seemed to be a deeper understanding and appreciation for the woman he perceived Zephyr to be. Pete had opened his heart to a 21 year old frustrated enginerering student in India. But Pradeep couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t open up to him. Instead he was stuck spinning the fantastic life of Varsha. Varsha‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parents were forcing her to settle down, which was code for get married and have kids. Varsha had a crush on someone from work. Varsha had a fight with her friends today. Pradeep was careful enough that his stories had all the details right and were believable. Pete never suspected once ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> was not who he was claiming her to be. And so he became a real friend to a fictitious woman. And somewhere in all this Pradeep started feeling alone again. He began feeling left out of the relation between this real guy and an imaginary woman. There was a real person in front of the screen, one with his own problems and frustrations yet he was stuck spinning yarns about Varsha‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s imaginary trials and tribulations. It had been alright when Pete was trying to just hit on him, but now he had got to know LighteningLord as a real person, and related to him as a real person, and he strongly felt like Pete could be someone Pradeep could be a friend with.  Pete was whom Pradeep could have been in another life. 

On a random day of vacation Pradeep got into an argument with his father, again. Only this time the words seemed to hurt more than ever before. They were the same words all over again ‚Ä" how Pradeep was wasting his life, how he was ill equipped to survive the world, how he always found new ways to disappoint his family- but this time something in Pradeep could not take it much longer. He cried. He cried his hearts out for how terrible his life had been, how unhappy he truly was. And all it got him was disgust from his father, his tears somehow only enraging him more instead. This cruelty shocked even Pradeep, so he rushed out of the house. He tried calling his friends up. Just for this once he would have to ask for one act of kindess more from him, some more warmth than perhaps he was allotted from them. None of them picked up, and a cursory look through social media let him know they were all out of town together for the weekend. That just broke him some more. Tear eyed he sat in the library, ignoring the librarian‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s jibes, and going on the forum. He logged in, and went to his chats with Pete. 

He planned to tell him everything. Who he was, how truly miserable he was and how sorry he was for lying to him for so long, but he truly had been a friend to Pete and hoped Pete would be a friend to him now. But he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do it. He knew it too well what would happen if he went away with it. It would take Pete two clicks to block him forever, delete all their chats as if nothing had ever happened. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t lose it now. Even if Pete‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s friendship and warmth and support was to a woman who never existed, it was there and it felt real and for now that was enough for Pradeep. He couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afford to lose even this affection. And so he found writing to Pete as Varsha. He poured his heart out to him, about how he had no real friends and how unhappy he was, and he filtered it all through Varsha. And almost unintentionally, he found himself showing an emotional vulnerability of Varsha‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that subtly conveyed to Pete that she was in a need of a man, a real man who would be there for her and hold her and support her. He knew saying some things like these would make Pete write more often, and write sweet and supportive things for him. It was wrong, but right now he needed all the love he could get. Pradeep had all but one friend after all.
