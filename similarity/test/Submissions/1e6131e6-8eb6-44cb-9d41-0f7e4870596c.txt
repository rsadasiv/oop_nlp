I once caught my aunt Jamila talking to herself while alone in the kitchen. I was in the hall of her house in Vaniyambadi reading at the dining table when I heard a noise. As if someone had giggled or laughed. I darted a look around. It was eleven in the afternoon. The open windows on either side of the hall looked out onto the compound of the house which was empty. My uncle was at work, the only people in the house were the two of us. I was just going to get back to reading when I heard it again, a muffled giggle.

Vaniyambadi is a small town. Upstairs, from my bedroom window, I  could see the purple and green, mist entwined Yelagiri Hills. They add an aura of grandeur to this small quiet place on earth. And right then in the Professor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Colony, where the house was located, most of the residents were away at work. The only sound was of crickets and the kitchen noises of my aunt cooking, so it was quite discomforting for mysterious giggles to be breaking my solitude.

 I listened attentively and now I could hear a faint murmur. It was coming from the kitchen. I got up and went over to it. The kitchen was located just ahead of the hall, through a corridor. There I stood near the door and peeked inside. My aunt was cutting a potato with quick, heavy slices of the knife. She had an absent-minded smile on her face. Then as I looked on her lips moved. I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make out what she was saying, though. As she muttered she shook her head slightly and smiled every now and then in a surprised manner as if she were shocked by what she was saying.

 Whenever my aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s name comes up in conversation between my parents, they always have the same reaction. A sort of amused condescending smile appears on my father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face while my mother smiles in a resigned manner as if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been teasing her about something for a long while.

‚ÄoeShe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good woman‚Ä¶poor thing.‚Äù She trails off and my father chuckles and says something along the lines of ‚ÄoeSad‚Ä¶very sad‚Ä¶‚Äù

 Underneath this gamely attitude, however, I sensed an air of nervousness. When as matters turned out I had to leave to my aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house, I pressed them to tell me more about her.

 Finally, one Friday over lunch my mom told me a bit about her history.

‚ÄoePoor thing‚Ä¶she has no children. She is barren you know. And living all the way in Vaniyambadi away from all relations. How lonely she must feel? She could have adopted maybe‚Ä¶Oh you know one of your other aunts has adopted! This adorable little Nepali child‚Ä¶‚Äù

 But my dad was smiling through his thick beard and I knew there was more to come. So as I ate I looked at him and waited.

My father cleared his throat and sipped some water. ‚ÄoeWell, maybe I shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say this but maybe it was good she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have children.‚Äù

‚Äoe√,,staghfirullah‚Ä¶Machan!‚Äù, my mother exclaimed.

My dad waved his hand dismissively. ‚ÄoeOk, ok. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just saying she is an odd character. You remember she got in with that Ahl Quran Ghosti and tried to convert her husband? My goodness the uproar she caused in the family over that.‚Äù

My mother just said ‚ÄoeShe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stopped all that now.‚Äù

‚ÄoeAnd you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve forgotten to mention her little affair.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù I asked as my mother made displeased noises.

My dad continued ‚ÄoeWell‚Ä¶I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know the details. So I shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t talk about it too much. But I do know there was this Hindu boy she tried to elope with. Her parents put a stop to it and she got married to Hussain.‚Äù

My dad shook his head and chuckled. ‚ÄoeSo much for being religious.‚Äù

‚ÄoeShe was young‚Äù my mom said tiredly. ‚ÄoeShe only became a good Muslim later. After she had married Hussain and settled down.‚Äù

‚ÄoeHmm‚Äù, said my dad, licking his fingers. ‚ÄoeYoungsters do have a way of going astray.‚Äù

I avoided his eyes as I ate. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really consider myself a Muslim and this did not sit well with my father.

He sat back in his chair. ‚ÄoeBut she became a good Muslim. And so will kids who are arrogant in the beginning become more faithful. After they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had a taste of real life.‚Äù

My father looked at me then and smiled.

 As I walked back to the dining table after having spied on my aunt I wondered whether this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t what was in store for my mother too in the end. Murmuring to herself in the kitchen after the baby bird has flown the roost. She would cook a meal that she and my father would eat while discussing me, discussing the neighbours, discussing relatives, anything except their own lives. Because by that time, their own lives would have been left untended for so long and would have become so withered and fragile, that the lightest touch would be enough to bring it crumbling down.

 I had come to Vaniyambadi in order to be close at hand to my mother while she went to an Ayurveda centre in a neighbouring village. She was there because her back had grown stiff and painful. I was not allowed to stay at the centre with her because it was a women-only place. So my mother had gone there with my grandmother. I did not want to come to Vaniyambadi. I did not want to be at hand for my mother. But I was free from classes and my father was busy at work, so I had to come.

 ‚ÄoeYou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re twenty years old. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re an adult now. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to be relying more and more on you. You have to take care of your mother." I could not argue against that. Except I did not feel twenty, however that was supposed to feel. I felt like I was shunted, marched at gun-point into adulthood. But anyway, two weeks ago I got on a plane from Dubai to Madras with my mother and grandmother and from there took a train to the village near Vaniyambadi. There, after making sure that the two of them had settled in well at the centre, I took the train to Vaniyambadi.

 It was a cloudy afternoon when I got off at the station. I met my aunt outside next to the taxis. I remembered her as a smiling shadow from my childhood. In the flesh, she seemed diminutive and I could see a streak of grey in her hair. I remembered that she was past fifty. Older than my mother. Aunt Jamila had a round face that was slightly pockmarked with the vestiges of the acne she might have had in her youth. She had hooded eyes that held your gaze with a quiet confidence that was all that remained of an allure and beauty that she must have once had.

 ‚ÄoeAssalaamualaikum. How are you Ibrahim?‚Äù

‚ÄoeWalaikumussalaam. Fine aunty. How are you? I hope I am on time.‚Äù

‚ÄoeOh I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m fine thank you. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re just on time. I got us a taxi.‚Äù

 She gestured behind her to a black taxi. I loaded my suitcase in the trunk. On the ride home she asked a few perfunctory questions about my mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s health and my father and his job. But mostly we rode in silence. When we got to the house, I had lunch (Vaniyambadi Biryani, which is amazing.). I ate alone as my aunt told me she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d already eaten and my uncle was at work. After lunch I had a shower and then slept.

In the evening I met my uncle Hussain. He was a small enthusiastic man who seemed to take an immediate liking to me. He was a professor of mechanical engineering at Priyadarshini college which was located nearby. He would often lecture me on theorems and properties which I would nod along to seriously. He thought I was pretty smart.

 My mom frequently told me that my aunt was eager to see me. This made me apprehensive. I feared awkward conversations with an over eager aunt with whom I had nothing in common. However I found quickly that Aunt Jamila gave me my space. She did not bother me in my room upstairs. She allowed me my solitude and seemed to dwell in her own. Ironically enough this piqued my interest in her. I thought of the things my parents had said about her and started observing her.

 She only called me down for meals or to tell me that she was leaving for art classes. She was a reasonably talented artist. The walls of the hall were decorated with landscapes that she had painted: The Yelagiri Hills, a large lake with the hills in the background, a lush copper coloured autumnal park scene and so on.

During dinner then, when Uncle Hussain would also be present, I would observe her. Was there in her eyes, in her smile, a secret sorrow? When laughing at something her husband said or looking at him while passing the dishes to him, did I see a reservation in her eyes? Did she see when she looked at her husband a lover and a partner or did she remember the Hindu boy she had lost?

 All very silly stuff I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll admit. She was polite and soft spoken and seemed fond of her husband. But yet there was a quietness about her, which perhaps I had imagined onto her, that intrigued me.

And I did not have anything else better to preoccupy my thoughts. I would write in my journal and sleep at odd hours. During that winter my life felt very much directionless and I saw this woman who had made decisions in her youth that had not paid off. And I wanted to see how they had affected her.

 My mom was to stay at the centre for two weeks. On the second week, Uncle Hussain decided we would go for a picnic to the hills. We took a bus that, coughing and rattling, hauled us and some tourists up the hillside. The bus swayed from side to side on the hair pin turns. I was glad I was not sitting next to my uncle who was looking pretty nauseous throughout the ride. My aunt sat in the middle between us. As we got off the bus at the top of the hill, my uncle promptly threw up into a nearby trash can. We were near the botanical gardens and he decided he would take some rest in the tourist centre inside. He insisted that we go on and see the lake by ourselves and eventually the two of us were cajoled into doing so.

 The sky was overcast with grey blue clouds. The fresh morning air was shaded, cold and moist. In front of us the lake shimmered and perfectly reflected the green hills surrounding it. I and my aunt stood in silence on the grassy banks.

Eventually I said ‚ÄoeIt looks wonderful doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it?‚Äù

‚ÄoeHm..It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all Allah‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s creation.‚Äù

I was a bit disappointed that this was all her insight to tell the truth.

‚Äoe‚Ä¶Yeah.‚Äù

She then gave me a sideward glance. ‚ÄoeYou know, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never seen you pray.‚Äù she said.

I was taken aback, both by the directness of the statement and the mischievous light in her eyes as she said it.

‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never seen you pray either.‚Äù I shot back.

She smiled and nodded.

‚ÄoeI pray when I feel like.‚Äù She said. Then she continued ‚ÄoeYou know when I was a child I went to a Christian Missionary School. We had to attend Mass and sing about Jesus. I remember that the nuns would sometimes be so overcome that they would cry, speak Jesus‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> name and hit their heads on the back of the wooden benches that everybody sat on. I felt bad for them. What was it, I thought, that bothered them so? I asked one of them one day and she told me that I was young and silly and that I would understand when I grew up.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWell‚Ä¶Do you understand now?‚Äù I asked.

She looked at me, her eyebrow up and surprised. ‚ÄoeNo.‚Äù she said simply.

We both laughed then. She had a young woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s laugh. A sound that was pleasantly surprised by its own existence.

She asked me how my studies were.

‚ÄoeThey‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re‚Ä¶going okay.‚Äù

‚ÄoeAh.‚Äù

Then she said, ‚ÄoeYou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re always reading or writing. Such a smart kid you are.‚Äù

I shrugged. I was never good at receiving compliments. Then in the spur of the moment, to make up for what I felt was a cold response, I confided in her.

‚ÄoeI want to be a writer.‚Äù

‚ÄoeOh!‚Äù, she said and clapped her hands excitedly. ‚ÄoeHow lovely! Have you written anything yet?‚Äù

‚ÄoeA little bit.‚Äù

‚Äoe‚ÄùYou must show me.‚Äù, she said.

‚ÄoeWhat do you write about?‚Äù

‚ÄoeStuff I notice. You never know what I borrow from the things I see around me.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWrite about this place.‚Äù, she said gesturing to the lake and the hills.

‚ÄoeWrite about an old, old woman who watches the lake and goes home feeling better.‚Äù

There was a silence between us then in which she seemed to weigh what she had just said.

Then she laughed lightly and said ‚ÄoeWhen I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m here, I feel so close to something vast. I am silly so I call it God and I pray.‚Äù

She turned and looked at me directly. I could see the bags under her eyes. She reached out and touched my shoulder.

‚ÄoeYou are so young‚Ä¶‚Äùshe said, ‚Äoebe careful.‚Äù

And we left it at that.

 Later that night, back at home, I was passing by my aunt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s room on my way to mine when I noticed her sitting on the prayer mat. She was sitting with her legs under her, her hands cupped. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail to prevent it from falling over when she prostrated on the ground. She looked up at me. I grinned and gave her a thumbs up. She patted the floor next to her and then pointed to a prayer mat lying on the bed behind her. I went to the washroom near the kitchen and I washed myself. I went back into her room and after drying myself on a towel, I picked up the prayer mat and spread it out next to her. She stood up.

 ‚ÄoeAllahu Akbar.‚Äù She said and raised her hands to her ears before folding them in front of her. I followed suit. We prayed three Rakat. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think much while going through the motions. My mind stayed quiet, the volume of my thoughts lowered. When we were done we both folded up the prayer mats. I felt a vastness inside me that I did not need to fill up with anything.

 A couple of days later I left Vaniyambadi to the Ayurveda Centre, where I picked up my healthier mother and my grandmother and escorted them back to Dubai. As the train left the station at Vaniyambadi, I had already begun to forget.

 I am writing this story about my aunt and I am trying to tell myself something. I am trying to wrest meaning out of her life. But it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter one way or another. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dead now, you know. It was unexpected. She passed away in her sleep two years ago. Weak heart. Uncle Hussain just recently got engaged to a divorcee from my hometown of Tirunelveli. I met her and she seemed nice. And I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really know what to say now, except that I am sad. But not sad enough.
