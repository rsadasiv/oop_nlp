‚ÄoeSo English Literature it would be, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄoeYes.‚Äù

I have never fought with my parents. So far as my studies were concerned they had always been the ultimate decision-makers. Right from my first day at school, it was *they *who had arranged for our car, then an Ambassador, to drop me. Again when it was time for my appearing at Board Examinations, my parents were the ones who had advised against an *Arts* choice.

I had always loved to read literature. Novels of Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters and Louisa Mary Alcott were among my favourites. But slowly when I grew up, I realised that these were just a drop in the vast ocean of English literature and language. I decided that I would do my graduation in English Literature.

‚ÄoeYou won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get an ounce from my money if you decide to study literature. And if and when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d regret your decision, it would be too late.‚Äù

My father, an otherwise taciturn individual, had been quite expressive.

My mother, on the other hand, had been rather supportive when I had ventured upon my career option. She was the ultimate voice of peaceful settlement in arguments at our home. Whether these were between me and my dad or between him with the rest of the family, she ascertained that things got sorted out amicably.

As and when my classes commenced, I found that I liked Dickens more than Shakespeare, poems of Eliot more than those of Keats or Shelley. It was so partly because the professors who taught Dickens and T.S. Eliot had rendered these writers as living as any leaf on a branch of a tree has got life.

‚ÄoeWhy are you reading from a second-hand edition of *Great Expectations*, dear?‚Äù

Tilottama *di* had made me lower my eyes that day.

‚ÄoeTS‚Äù, as we used to call her, had given me a brand new Penguin edition of *Great Expectations*, the day I came first in her weekly assessment tests. I had written about Dickensian old England, a country I had never visited but about which I had dreamt many a dream. It had, somehow, impressed TS and she had handed over the book as a prize.

‚ÄoeAre you aware how lucky you are to receive a prize from TS?‚Äù

Sneha, my classmate, had quipped. Really, TS personified perfection. Meticulous, articulate and vocal about students‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> issues, TS was totemic in our college. Always clad in well starched cotton saris, beautiful *tussars* in the winter months, she stood for everything we all aspired to become one day. A petite figure with a bobbed hairdo, TS‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s entry into her lecture rooms were always accompanied by a huge round of applause.

The book presented by her has become very special to me over the years. On the very first page, TS had scrawled in her beautiful handwriting in black ink, ‚Äoe*With Love ‚Ä" Tilottama Sen*. *Always, almost always, try to follow your dream*‚Äù.

The English language and its literature which I loved with all my heart, has provided me with an immense lot of opportunities. It has also taken away a lot from me. For one, I had lost my father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s support and promises of a financial assistance later in life. It may sound strange, but that was then the way it was.

‚ÄoeHow can a girl from the Banerjee household ever be inclined towards literature?‚Äù

My paternal uncle, my *jethu*, had once asked my mother, bewilderment writ large across his otherwise calm face and voice. My family had a lineage of honest lawyers, who were as conversant in the dictates of the law as in the rules of human behavioural science. People in our neighbourhood said, law runs along the veins of the Banerjee clan.

‚ÄoeAre you aware that those who opt for literature for their higher studies lie at the very bottom line at board exams? People still consider them to be inferior to those who choose science. Given the choice, you should never study literature.‚Äù

*Jethu*, the quintessential Puritan, had been the mouth-piece of family dissent.

But that day, I had found my sole sympathiser in my mother. She had stood firm and went, at length, against the tide of mass protest.

‚ÄoeBut she can pursue her higher studies abroad, if she fares well. And there is the option of professorship if her grades are high here. I really think she has taken a good decision.‚Äù

My mother has forever been my staunch supporter, right from the day when she had realised that I was getting good grades in school and was the apple in my teachers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> eyes.

So without a penny of financial support from my dad, I had ventured into the first day of my ultimate graduation from a reputed college of Kolkata. I had begun to give tuitions, so as to gather money to purchase my study material. College Street in North Kolkata is reputed for selling second-hand books. On the pavement stalls, lie scattered gems of literature. It was from there that I bought my texts. I had haggled about the prices because I was armed with only a paltry sum of money, given to me by my mother and from breaking my piggy bank.

Shakespeare had jostled for a space under my arms, beside Joseph Conrad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s *Lord Jim*. Tilottama di had insisted that we read our prescribed texts, before attending her lectures. This usually prepared her students for the detailed analyses and decoding of texts which she delivered at class.

‚ÄoeStudents, my first question for the day for you, would be ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Do you consider Shakespearean texts to be still relevant today?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>‚Äù Tilottama Sen, the Dean of the Arts faculty as well as the Departmental Head, had put forward an open forum for her students.

How we used to love her lectures and especially the way she read out from the texts!

It so happened that I was a regular topper in her class. When I secured a first class honours degree in English Literature in my final year, I found to my stupefaction that I, again, had stood first in the overall Arts section at my college. My joy knew no bounds. I had studied hard and this was the fruit of the burning of my midnight oil.

‚ÄoeCongratulations. You really deserved it, Sahana,‚Äù Tilottama di, my idol throughout, had extended her outstretched arms.

‚ÄoeThank you.‚Äù

What more could I tell her? Should I tell her that without her support and encouragement, I could never have overcome my barriers? Should I tell her that I had almost wished her to congratulate me first?

Years have passed by.

Between that day when I had topped my batch in college and the here and now, twenty summers have gone by. I have married a man who, a couple of years elder than me, was far more mature worldly wise. I, whose head had been deeply engrossed in literary pursuits, had suddenly found myself thrown into the status quo of family life. Ours had been an arranged affair from the very beginning.

‚ÄoeOur daughter never takes her eyes off her books.‚Äù My father had told my would-be father-in-law, when he had come to see me.

By that time, my parents had accepted and eventually rejoiced in the final outcome of my results. My father, who had been so averse to my choice of literature in the beginning, had slowly become proud of me. He told my *jethu* one day, ‚ÄoeSahana taught me for the first time in my life that I can also go wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄoeDidn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I tell you from the very beginning that our daughter would make us proud one day?‚Äù

I sometimes wondered whether my parents, so far apart in their opinions, had been fatally attracted towards each other while tying the knot.

Today my children, a daughter of thirteen and a son of eight, call my parents their ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>soul mates‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>.

There are sundry matters about them which only *my* *parents* are aware of. They are not revealed to us. We, modern day parents, remain blissfully unaware about things like when my daughter had a fight with her classmate and had sprained her knee. I was shocked the other day, when my own mother said, ‚ÄoeYou should give more time to Laura and Leo.‚Äù

‚ÄoeBut I do give them ample time, Ma. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what work pressure means now-a-days. I and your son-in-law have to work round the clock in order to fulfil their whims and fancies.‚Äù

Laura and Leo. Perhaps following the laws of primogeniture, Laura remains inches taller than Leo in height as well as in intellect. She is the prefect of her class at school.

Leo remains totally immersed in the world of sports. Football and cricket gushes through the veins of his arteries and books on these, are his bedtime companions. Lionel Messi and Virat Kohli are his icons. Posters of cricket legends adorn his side of the room which he shares with his elder sis. Laura‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s share of the wall is curiously and impeccably shorn of any posters. Instead her study table has about a dozen books strewn all over it at any given point of time.

‚Äoe*Yay*!‚Äù

‚ÄoeWhat was that for, Laura?‚Äù I asked my daughter when I saw a brilliant smile and outstretched arms, spread heavenwards, engulf my visual panorama.

‚ÄoeI stood first in the inter-school debate competition, held last week. Our principal had called me personally today to hand over the certificate.‚Äù

‚ÄoeBut that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s excellent.‚Äù

‚ÄoeMa, Baba wants me to go for the Joint Entrance Examinations after I complete my board exams. But you know, I always wanted to take up English Literature later onwards. Moreover,‚Äù here Laura paused and brushed aside the impending gloom as if by a magic wand, ‚Äoehe knows that I fare well in all my English tests. In fact, I am the topper in class. I edit the school magazine. Opting for Engineering or Medical is not what I aim for in life.‚Äù

Looking at my daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stubborn countenance that day, had reminded me of a similar day, so many years ago. That also had been a confrontation between me and my parents regarding the choice of a career. Similarly, I too had opted to study English Literature. The extreme end of science borders on philosophy. Einstein is considered to be more a philosopher than a mere scientist. The choice of an ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Arts‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> or a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Science‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> field of study is totally man-made. The point where the two paths converge forms the pivot of human philosophy.

But in order to pursue a literary ambition, one has to have a passion for it. Love for literature and English particularly, cannot be cultivated. Either you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve a flair for it. Or otherwise you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.

Seeing Laura overcome her emotional obstacles and decide to wade her way against the tide made me proud of her. People might say she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just following her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s footsteps. But I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d prefer to call this the circle of life.
