Stories From Purgatory 

By Shefali Shah Choksi. 

I. 

Wait! You can see me? You donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think there is just a pile of musty, dark cloths hanging on this branch? 

Please! Listen! 

Oh well. 

This happens every time; they either ignore or take to their heels in terror, if they are able. The worst is when they are unable and they just lie there before me, like a heap of musty cloth. Then, once they return to their bodies, they pick their corporeal beings up and leave. 

I do not possess a corporeal being. Or perhaps I do; I cannot always decide. You see, I do have form, and mostly, I can command it. But I also know it is a form that fails to register as such. People see, walk, talk through me as though I no longer exist. 

And part of me agrees: I no longer exist, as such. I feel like I am in a twilight jar out of which I can see the world around, a familiar, recognizable world, just out of reach and touch, and its light fails to seep into this bubble around me. 

Just beyond, often behind, I can see, sense others walking well-trod unseen paths to the other world, led by denizens with lightening whips. They walk the Fifth Direction, the unknowable one that only the dead walk. They all seem confused and sad, unprepared for this path, not yet, not just yet, no matter how old or sick the bodies they leave behind. But I envy them. For just like the world of light and the living, I cannot reach or touch their world. The denizensâ€<sup>TM</sup> lightening whips keep me away from joining the throngs to the next world. They are not cruel and their eyes are full of kindness and sympathy, but they shake their heads and tell me to wait. 

So I wait. 

I have no wish to join the living. I already know of their world and frankly, it is boring to always be running after a comfortable routine, and the world whirls too fast because no one can really agree about anything, the least of all what comfort or routine or running mean. And all that eating and the helplessness! Who wants that? Who would CHOOSE that? Sometimes, I listen to their fire-side stories and all the claims that the dead want to be alive and how life is all this big thing. But they forget that when life leaves, so does the wish to hang on to it. 

But my non-corporeal being still mimics the long-forgotten gestures. 

I must confess, I miss the light. 

But then there are stories, here, of here, of elsewhere and they seep in and out of all boundaries. 

Sometimes I imagine that I see the Lord with his Bull walk by, though he rarely does that anymore. It is the Dark Age, *Kal Yug*, and there arenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t that many virtuous souls who need the Lord to lead them to be processed. But he needs to keep an eye out for unpredictable elements or accidents. Sometimes, beyond the twilight mists, I feel a hill, when the mists are low and light. There is a palace there, which marks the boundary of the Lordâ€<sup>TM</sup>s living quarters. No one can see the Lordâ€<sup>TM</sup>s palace, of course. This one belongs to his brother, he with the flying chariot, a garden blooming with gold flowers fragrant like nothing on earth. And then there is the Underworld Ganga, the Milky Way of the stars with a thousand unimaginable worlds perched on her banks; the well-lived Ganga that weaves through the human populace ponderously like an engorged serpent, deep as the ocean; the same waters are known to course through the Unknown world of the dead, the unborn, and other varied forms of energy the living are shut away from. 

That river leads to onward lands. 

If the stories are to be believed, of course. 

I know some other stories too. I know my name, Jigna, and that it means wanting. I can move my head most eloquently and use my wrists to express a plethora of responses. I spend large amounts of times seeing but waste none deciphering what I see. I often mirror everything, though, but I know that mimicking the living does not make me one of them any more than a stone sporting petals makes it a branch. 

I know that am one but not the only ghost stuck to this bole.  And though it has taken me long years, moments, millennia to concede, now I know that I am a ghost.  In vernacular, the word for ghost is the same as the word for the past, *bhoot*. But I can remember no concrete past. 

The last concrete memory I have is of a song that called down some fire, that tied all of us together. The strains are forgotten, but unforgettable, it resounds through my wrists, and through the essence of all tenants of the *gulmohar*, like handcuffs made of smoke. 

What I do not know is why that particular knot on that particular tree has been chosen for me. 

So I hang on to the tree, the little *gulmohar*, and I wait to hear the story, or some story, perhaps any story would do. I hang upside down on the branch, forcing silence on my thoughts and I listen as the twilight of all the worlds gathers around me. 

II.         The Story Under the Tree 

Ramu shook his head, part resignation, part amusement, as he patted down the fertilizer gently around the half-barren *gulmohar*. At the same time, Jigna, the ghost, one of the inhabitants on the bole of the tree, shook her head, mirroring Ramuâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sentiment. 

Now of course, Ramu couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t see Jigna and was in fact unaware of his silent audience; Jigna was not the only inhabitant of the *gulmohar*. They all liked only one side of the bole of the tree, where no leaves ever grew, no matter the frequent fertilizers. It would have been crowded, if indeed, space for the unforgotten and incorporeal behaved the way it does for material ones. They were not even countable, so Jigna couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t say (if say, indeed, she could) how many actually inhabited the space on, around, over, and within the tree. 

Sometimes, they all folded, stretched, even blinked off and on, as though in a predetermined dance they all had forgotten they were part of. 

The tree did not look anything like the father-tree; it stood in its corner, its tallness no virtue of its own but borrowed from the clay bricks on which it stood, diagonally across from the huge *Peepal* which was the hub of the spiritual ethos of the street. By a curious trick of the shadows and the sun, the small *gulmohar* was usually forgotten, except by Ramu, who saw all clearly, all, that is, except the ghosts, of course. 

The old warriorâ€<sup>TM</sup>s ghost suspected that Ramu knew the reason why the bole on one side of the tree refused to leaf, and actually seemed to grow larger. But Jigna was not sure. She wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t sure of a great deal; sometimes, she couldnâ€<sup>~</sup>t tell for sure if it was day, if it rained, or if the dust was worried. Only sometimes, on foggy twilights misted with the smoke of burning logs, she knew an almost remembered wetness around her, enveloping like a blanket or force field. At these times, her center burned with a sudden thought that there was no time anymore, even for her, who did not know what time was. She searched the burning for more, but it only burned stronger until she fled. 

The bole got another brown spot after such burnings, and the kind tree always forgave. 

Jigna figured that was why the tree brought forth only flame flowers; in fact, she had often perched at edge of the bole, hearing Ramu tell visitors how, in late Spring, even in Fall, his tree looked as though it were on fire. He was always so careful to build his night fires on the bole side, where nothing grew, thinking to spare the living tree the stink of its burning flesh, as he piled on twigs and stolen wooden planks in the hole on the ground. 

Of course, this was not exactly comfortable for the non-living of the tree. The smokes always brought all the ghosts suddenly awake and they would leap around the whorls of the bark, up the trunk, out into the twilight, screaming too loud for Ramu to notice over the cackling of tortured wood. 

The ghosts loved clear nights best; they enjoyed hovering and they blinked on and off as children played and later, Motabaa, the matron of the street, told stories as she oiled the black, serpentine locks of the local girls. The child-ghosts swung from the festoons garlanded around their tree for a whole moment, until the jealous, upset pigeons and crows drove them off. 

It was an evening that promised to stretch into a long night of Shivratri, the night of the Lord of Ghosts. The warrior ghost, who remembered such things, explained it all to Jigna, waving his thumbs most loquaciously, while Jigna expressed her wonder and joy at understanding it all with her wrists. Over long moments, Jigna and the warrior had acknowledged awareness of each other whenever they were on at the same time, and so, naturally, communicated in a way. 

Finally, the twilight deepened and Motabaa sat under the little *gulmohar*, watching the children at their play. It was to be a night when sleep has to be avoided, a night to be aware till the dawn. The old woman knew that it was almost time. Long nights always needed her stories and the children knew this. The women finally emerged from their finished kitchens, bangles jangling, gathering around Motabaa with the next dayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s mending in their fingers. She smiled at them all and waited till the children had settled among the women. Then, she smiled deeper and it seemed that her wrinkled face held a million stories within their mazes. It was time for a good, long listening. 

The stars, too, it seemed listened, though no one really noticed them, what with all the festoons and lamps. The first games of tag and *chor-sipahi*, thieves-and-police, were done and the youngest daughter-in-law of the neighborhood had served refreshing *nimbu pani* to the players. Motabaa dipped the top of the longest fingers of her right hand into the just warmed jasmine hair oil and thoughtfully rubbed it between her palms before distantly beginning her massage the scalp of the nearest child, with sure, wizened hands. She noticed the girl beneath her hands and started the story in the same instant, almost choosing it at the last minute among her horde, seeing whose head she held within her fingers. 

*Donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t trust foggy nights with just a sliver of moon, *she began*, a cold moon that wraps a shimmer around herself to keep the night at bay. The moon was cold again, and she started wishing; it is the moon-wishing night that breathes him out. You can tell it is him by the music he doesnâ€<sup>~</sup>t yet play, which dances in his foggy pupils, not blinding him, but granting him sight denied to normal people like us.  * 

*He has many names and he best likes the side of a *bawal* tree, or the wall of a hundred-year old well. If you ever, ever find yourself returning home under the shimmered moon, and you find him watching your feet dust, give him a Rupee and a story. * 

*That way, he will not follow you as he is bound by the story, and because he owes you a Rupee and no one follows a person one owes a debt to!  * 

III. 

The stars glow ruminatively at the end of the tale. The story has given me a question. I am still here, in this curve of the *gulmohar*, so that must not be the story I hold out for. 

I will wait. Perhaps will actually see the Lord and his Bull and ask him a question. 

I must remember the question. For the past, all questions are answered. 


Brief Biography:
