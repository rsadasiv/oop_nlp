Dusk.

Somewhere in the universe, a star explodes. Light travels. Time bends around. Space contracts. Reality resonates.

He walks up the spiral stairs to his one-room flat on the terrace of a four-storey building, sensing, in his head, the world spinning about its axis. With his stare fixed on the steps and his brain murky from the noise of the city he climbs up to his room.

He lives in Udaipur. The city is enveloped by tribal belts, which is why he lives here ‚Ä" to be around a prehistoric world. He earns his living by serving as a manager of a caf√©, three days a week, and for the rest of time he contributes to a local socialist newspaper ‚Ä" Samta Sandesh ‚Ä" published fortnightly. The newspaper is run by Mr. Das. Mr. Das is in his late forties ‚Ä" a short and chubby man with a fat belly bulging out ‚Ä" and has run the newspaper for fifteen years.

His articles contain a buried anguish of the dying culture of the tribal communities inside them, crushed beneath the burden of development. However, the part he relishes most is writing poems. In his poems lies an idea of a free world ‚Ä" a world where everyone would accept their human failings, their damages, and for a moment, hold on to each other and weep together.

There is a Mrs. Das too, with whom he shares an erotic relationship. She is short and slim, with dark eyes and honey brown skin, streaks of silver visible in her shoulder-length hair. On Monday afternoons, when Mr. Das is usually out, he goes to their home, submits his articles and poems to Mrs. Das, and makes love to her.

The first time he had gone to submit his writings, Mr. Das was not home. Mrs. Das had asked him for a cup of tea and then, over the tea, he had recited his poems. Words and smiles were exchanged but beneath them, silently, lust was exchanged too.

He is dark and tall and slender with a straight posture and sharp features. He has a voice which is rare and nonchalant and his eyes are intense. A subject among women, as his father was. He had been in love with a girl in the university but she had failed him to titillate him, like all other girls of his age. He had then resigned himself to chastity until the day he met Mrs. Das and discerned a warmness welling up in his trousers at the sight of her tight waist.

He carries in himself a secret of being libidinous towards older women.

Every week he ejaculates in her navel and takes a photograph of it. He does not want to make art; he is merely marking the confluence of two erotic energies. He has repeatedly felt that erotic energy of femininity rests in the navel and that of masculinity in the semen.

He tries to assimilate what she seeks in him; however he does not credit the idea that it is merely the physical pleasure that she is after. She listens to him attentively, diligently even. She seems to understand him as a mother would understand her child. She makes him feel important by the way she makes love to him, by letting him fill her navel with his semen as if every drop of it is irreplaceable.

Might their erotic relationship be an escape for her? For some reason it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t appear to him as an escape from marriage. An escape from life, perhaps.

In a far, far world, a leaf crushes under a foot. A dust particle tumbles. A metal rusts. A whale drowns.

In his room, he pours himself some whisky, lights a cigarette, and retires to the ghazals of Iqbal Bano.

He listens to her ghazals not because of the words of revolution that they contain, not anymore. He had learnt that words are dangerous and having learnt that he had come to disbelieve them. In her ghazals he seeks a voice ‚Ä" voice of a woman belonging to an older world. Stealthily, the voice works over him and an encrustation of certain calm forms over his heart. He is twenty-four, a youth. Still, listening to the music of a bygone era unwinds him and sets the juices inside him flowing to wherever they should be. He does not remember how old he was when he first heard the voice of the past but he has a vision that it was the beginning; that he was born with the foreknowledge of voices from history.

Darkness. His father is about to reach climax. He is about to be conceived. And the voice of a woman belonging to an older world is pooling in the room, drowning out the voices of his parents.

His father is a bureaucrat, a public intellectual, and a man of strong resolve. Around the time he was born an ancient mosque had been demolished by some religious fanatics, which had led to communal riots between two religious groups. His father had obliquely taken up the defense of the destroyers of the mosque.

His mother had departed giving him birth and it was claimed that he was the reason; that he was difficult to bring in this world. Throughout his life he had borne the silent blames for her death. As for him, he would have liked to not come out at all, if coming out meant her demise; he would have liked to stay in the other world ‚Ä" inside her mother, dark and soggy. If he is not here by choice then what binds him to this world, to this place? Why not, while walking by the road, he raises aloft, and keep going high until he no longer belong to this world, and merges with his mother finally?

His body is an echo of his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s body, he knows that, but he also knows that his mind is not an echo of his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind.

His mind, he feels, is older.

He carries with him a mascot ‚Ä" a tiny white sharp stone ‚Ä" which was gifted to him by a historian friend who told him that it was an early man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tool, almost ten thousand years old. At times when his head goes dizzy from the din of this epoch, he clenches the stone and lets his eyelids fall. In the darkness behind his eyes he sees the stone flowing in the river of time, enduring time, to be present here in this moment, carrying in itself innumerable moments since time immemorial. His mind can reach out to all the moments bound together in the stone. His mind is antique.

His mind, he feels, is older and purer.

He saw his father as a branch of the tree which emerged from the red soil, red by the blood of the oppressed. Having decided not to be a descendant of a blood sucking tree of history, he freed himself from the branch which was his father. He left his home after university for he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to transform into another branch of the tree, into his father. Fatherless, motherless, without ancestry, he floats like a leaf in a stream.

 On Saturdays he goes to Jhadol ‚Ä" a tribal village situated at the periphery of the city ‚Ä" to volunteer in an elementary school run by a non-profit organisation. The school is amid the mountains and greenery. It is a small pink colour building with two classrooms, a headmaster‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office, and a tiny kitchen. He thinks of it as the pink lotus in the middle of dark green algae.

The school, he thinks, is filled with stories ‚Ä" stories bearing the burden of history. These are stories in making of course, but destined to end as the stories of their ancestors had, perhaps more poorly so. Nonetheless, he believes these stories are beautiful as they are, however futile, however incomplete, however incoherent.

In the village he lodges in the house of Shantilal Kharadi, one of his students. It is an adobe house at the foot of a hill. The house is the color of earth, has a green door, and a courtyard having lemon and neem trees. It smells of earth and sheep.

He takes pleasure in being in the tribal settings. Bathing in the river with topless women around, he feels waves of delight running down his body. He likes watching layers after layers of yellow mustard fields, merging in horizon with the blue of the sky. The scenery soothes his nerves and brings calm to the turmoil inside his head. He toils in their farms, he participates in their festivals, he follows their rituals, and he drinks local alcohol with them.

He comes back on Sunday evenings with stories in his mind, and sets upon writing.

 In the university he had believed in revolution. He and his friends had called each other comrades, and had led several protests against the oppression by the government. However, he had felt incompleteness in the freedom which came with that life.

He had felt the incompleteness because he is slow. The pace with which the blood in his veins flows is, he has repeatedly felt, slower than the pace of civilisation. Being slow has, in his own eyes, singled him out. In consequence, he is condemned to a different life ‚Ä" a quieter life, a slower life, far from the reaches of human advancements.

Inside the mask of an outer revolution that he wore was his true revolution: revolution against his lost boyhood. As is the case with revolutions, there was a hope beneath his inner revolution ‚Ä" the hope of winning it, hope of finding his lost boyhood, his lost mother. He has left that life behind, yet deep down he is still a child who, like every child, seeks for comfort in his mother. Mother, because he is a boy, and who do boys live for if not for their mothers? Unknowingly, he has started to seek comfort in Mrs. Das.

After leaving the university, there were a thousand lives he might have lived, but he chose this one. Even in the life he is living now, he knows, he is free from body, and not from mind. If, as they say, body is an extension of mind, how could he be free? And if body really is the extension of mind, what does his body say about his mind? Is his mind as dark as his body? He thinks of cobra: black, venomous, malicious. His mind resembles a cobra.

Older, purer, and darker.

 In some distance, a dog barks. A glass breaks. A tree falls. A wind blows.

He meditates: If body came out of mind, is it possible that the origin of this world lies in a mind? In a thought? Is it possible that we are all merely extensions of a single thought? That we are united after all?

He would like to flow back in the river of time and reach the origin. If only he could know the singular thought, his mind, like a cobra, could shed its skin of memories and past. That is the only way he could be free; yet how does one flow back in time, he does not know.
