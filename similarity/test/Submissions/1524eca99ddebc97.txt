*Are hills like white elephants**?* 

*---Sunil Sharma* 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? 

The teaser fails to disengage Sandip from the  iPhone. 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? Priya insists, fingering her curly mane, lower lip pouting, eyes wandering across the room and outside. 

He is orbiting in another space; detached from the lunch-hour din in the MacDonald in Colaba, Mumbai. 

â€oeWhy do you not pay attention?â€ She asks irritated. Sitting near the exit, Priya watches the Friday rush hour traffic with the bored expression of a regular. 

â€oeOK.â€  He says. 

*Can hills be like white elephants*? 

â€oeWhat kind of nonsense is this?â€ Sandip asks, his eyes unfocussed. â€oeHow can they ever be?â€ 

â€oeThat is my question too.â€ Priya chirps in.  â€oeI asked my professor. He said they can be.â€ 

â€oeBut how?â€ Asks Sandip. 

â€oeWellâ€¦professor says it is a short fiction by a famous American.â€ 

â€oeDo they write fiction?â€ 

â€oeWho?â€ 

â€oeThe Yankees? Thought they just made dollarsâ€¦rest is shit!â€ 

â€oeYou are a nerd, Sandip!â€ 

â€oeIn love with a doll!â€ 

Priya smiles. â€oeNada!â€ 

â€oeWhat the hell!â€ 

â€oeWhat?â€ 

â€oeThis Nada stuff!â€ 

â€oeOh!â€ 

Sandip is not yet disengaged. â€oeWhy you drive me crazy with this stuff?â€ 

â€oeWhich stuff?â€ asks Priya, rolling her eyes. 

â€oeThis literary stuff! Heavy-duty!â€ 

â€oeBecause I am doing an MA in English Lit. That is why.â€ 

â€oeBut I am not into thisâ€¦â€ 

â€oeSo what?! Ainâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you my BF?â€ 

â€oeThat does not give you any right to ply me with this boring stuff!â€ 

Priya flutters long and arched eyebrows. â€oeDo not be a mean nerd?â€ 

â€oeI am not nerd. Do you know about programming, Java?â€ 

â€oeNada!â€ 

â€oeMy gawd!â€ 

Sandip sips Coke, fiddling iPhone again. The doors swing open, carrying a bit of traffic sound inside the outlet fast filling up with teen crowd---torn jeans and Tees and Mohawk and undercut styles. American accent prevails. 

Priya says, â€oeWhy nasty?â€ â€oeI am not. But do not hand me your Nada-Nada thing.â€ 

â€oeNada.â€ 

Sandip shrugs off. Lost in another realm. 

â€oeListen yaar,â€ says Priya. â€oeI love literature. What is wrong?â€ 

â€oeIt is for moronsâ€¦â€ 

â€oeNada!â€ 

â€oeHell with you!â€ 

â€oeSeems you not interested in me?â€ 

â€oeWhy?â€ 

â€oeBecause you do not show any interest in my interests.â€ 

â€oeDo you in mine?â€ 

Priya ignores the sullen accusation. Then she stands up. â€oeI am leaving.â€ 

Sandip gets startled. â€oeWhy?â€ 

â€oeBecause you areâ€¦â€ 

â€oeâ€¦a nerd. OK. I am. Tell me. I am serious now. Ask me. I am focused, real-time.â€ 

Undecided, Priya lingers. 

â€oePlease! Honey!â€ 

â€oeOK.â€ 

She settles down. They sip the Coke and crunch the chips. 

â€oeGo ahead. Ask.â€ Sandip sounds eager. â€oeThat thing about hills.â€ 

â€oeI asked can hills look like white elephants?â€ 

Sandip scratches his thick hair with a top knot. â€oeNo idea.â€ 

â€oeWell, this is a home assignment. Write a piece on the story Hills like white elephants.â€ 

â€oeGo ahead and writeâ€¦â€ 

â€oeBut I cannot figure it out. Need your helpâ€¦â€ 

â€oeShow me.â€ 

â€oeLook at the circled dialogue on the tab,â€ Priya says. â€oeOr better, I will read it out. Here it goes: 

*â€<sup>~</sup>All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t that bright?â€<sup>TM</sup>  â€<sup>~</sup>That was bright.â€<sup>TM</sup>  â€<sup>~</sup>I wanted to try this new drink. Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s all we do, isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t it â€" look at things and try new drinks?â€<sup>TM</sup>  â€<sup>~</sup>I guess so.â€<sup>TM</sup> The girl looked across at the hills.  â€<sup>~</sup>Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re lovely hills,â€<sup>TM</sup> she said.  â€<sup>~</sup>They donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t really look like white elephants. I just meant the colouring of their skin through the trees.â€<sup>TM</sup>  â€<sup>~</sup>Should we have another drink?â€<sup>TM</sup>  â€<sup>~</sup>All right*.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Tell me now.â€ 

Sandip scratches his hair---a habit to annoy her she knows---and grins, â€oeWhat the hell!â€ 

â€oeIs that all?â€ 

â€oeDoes it matter?â€ 

â€oeYeahâ€¦it does.â€ Priya says bitterly. â€oeYou are like her American companion.â€ 

â€oeOh, yeah! I am American! Middle-class India is American.â€ 

â€oeYou are a turn-off.â€ 

â€oeWhy?â€ 

â€oeYou areâ€¦like that American only in the story.â€ 

Sandip grins. â€oeIf the hills look like elephants or not, what does it matter? It is fiction.â€ 

She stands up. â€oeIt does not matter. To you and her companion. OK. It never did, will never do. I am leaving, walking out on you, in factâ€¦â€ 

She takes away her bag and leaves. 

Sandip, hurt, looks around. Nobody is paying attention to this little drama. After a quick bite, he too leaves hurriedly, muttering sotto voce: *What the fuck! Just for a fictional character and an atrocious plot!*
