Every weekend morning she would wake up before anyone else in the house, race to the main gate to grab the newspaper and open it to the obituaries page. Once the adults were up they would jostle for the sole paper that the house subscribed to and her turn wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come till the evening. It was not that she did not read the rest of the newspaper; she would spend at least an hour combing through the range of stories and information it carried. The obituaries, however, captivated her, as she looked through the pictures and descriptions. Gaunt faces, happy faces, photographs of much younger selves who would now be unrecognizable. She would meticulously calculate the age of the dead by the dates given, and would decide whether to grieve the death of a young son, or feel some solace for that of an old grandparent. She also carefully read the names of the mourners trying to identify any familiar ones. She was only eleven so wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know as many people, but sometimes the names would ring familiar, like the ones she heard at home. Sikh names would particularly attract her; there was always an Amarjeet or Daljit or Devinder and she would halt on the memory of the Amarjeets, Dalijits and Devinders she knew. She imagined what it would be like to read their names in the column with the familiar faces staring blankly at her. New words sprung at her ‚Ä" chautha, uthaoni, rasam pagri. She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bother to find out what they meant, just that they were fascinating, magical words that spoke of another realm, one that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have school and homework in it.

 She would not linger on the page if others were around; then she would just skim the column and move on. She would read about murders and accidents and relish every detail the writer had to offer. Sometimes she would get upset at the lack of description of, say, the mangled remains of a driver in an accident, and wished there were more pictures of victims. The stories on offer were quite often very typical ‚Ä" wives being killed for dowry or something else, old people being killed to rob the house, rash drivers suffering for their arrogance and lack of restraint and so on. Occasionally, a killer would be dramatic and creative ‚Ä" for instance that man who killed his wife in haste, cut her up and put her to stew in a tandoor. Or the one who killed an entire royal family in a matter of just a few minutes. Then her imagination would spike and she would lay awake for hours in bed picturing how the incident would have unfolded. She would add her two-penny bit whenever details got blurry or didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fit. Sometimes she would wake up on a Sunday to historical slaughter ‚Ä" like that of the Buddha in Bamiyan. She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really know who the Taliban were or what they wanted; however, she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help tearing up for a piece of history she would never even have the option of seeing. She would have dreams of trekking up to the top of the statue and rappelling down, taking pictures‚Ä¶

 As far back as she could remember, she had always opened the newspaper to the obituary section first and then went backwards from local city news to front-page necessities. Every Friday she would look at the programme listings for the weekend and move show timings. Occasionally, she would move to the sports section and then make her way to the front. She would snatch the paper out of her grandmother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, who would be peering at it with her thick rimmed glasses, the page held almost up to her nose. She never dared to ask of course, but often wondered if her grandfather had ever had his picture in this column. Which picture of his would they have chosen? She really liked the one in his beloved garden holding the new-born version of her. How calmly he looked at the camera in that one, relaxed on a chair holding his new grandchild. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how she remembered him ‚Ä" even in the living memories that she had of him, she could picture his face only on the basis of the photographs she had of him. She wondered at the fate of the obituary people, remembered through that little box on a big page, only to be thrown out the next day. Or did they lie forgotten in the library of newspapers? What happened to those who were not fortunate enough to be put into these columns?

 This worried her greatly and she wanted to do something to ensure she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have a fitting position in the column she loved. She knew she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t trust anyone to get her obituary right and therefore decided to write it herself. This wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to be an easy task; it had to be special and crafted with care. For weeks she combed the newspaper looking for the right template. There would be a picture of course; her latest passport photo would do: not frivolous, not serious but her face recognisably visible. The next choice involved size ‚Ä" half-a-page was too much, and best reserved for celebrities and politicians. Among the smaller sizes, she had to take out a scale to measure a box that felt suitable. The symmetry in a 4x4 square looked the most appropriate and belied a vertical or horizontal choice. The picture would go on the left with the her name and years of existence below it. To the right of the picture would be a quote from a book she had recently read ¬≠‚Ä" ‚ÄoeI keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copybooks; and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end.‚Äù Below that would be the name and address of the local gurudwara with timings for the ardaas, and then ‚ÄoeIn Grief‚Äù and the name of her parents. When it was ready, she found a spot on the obituary page of the Sunday newspaper and carefully pinned it there. It looked perfect. It filled her with such excitement that she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait for it to be published soon.

 The occasion would have to be orchestrated, of course. Forced to go to bed at 9pm on school nights while the house watched TV, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d activate the reel in her head and play the starring role in deadly scenarios ‚Ä" a slit of a wrist here, a pop of a pill there, a quick jump off the roof. Add a lover, a relative, best friend. A jilted romance setting, an abusive relationship, an assault, some jealousy ‚Ä" there was no dearth of characters and milieus. When something seemed unsatisfactory, she would promptly alter the plot and change the ending. Death was so easy, so fearless; here today, gone tomorrow. Her grandmother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mourning and praying, mourning and praying that went on through the night became the background score to all the action. During boring classes at school, she would scribble the front-page reports on the nightly deaths in the back of her notebooks. Very often she would burn the pages quietly in the backyard during afternoon siesta. Night after night she recovered scenarios, reopened the naratives, even those she had burnt away, till she could shortlist a few. When the moment came, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d pick the one that felt right then.

 In the mean time, she devised a plan to ensure her obituary would be available and waiting. She placed the 4x4 cut out into a 5x4 envelope and put her parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> name on it with the home address neatly scribed. She rummaged through her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stationery drawer and found stamps and an old postcard. She conducted a dry run with the postcard and found that the turnaround time for mail was two days within the same pincode. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d give it three just to be safe. She had the envelope stamped and ready, and carried it in her school bag everyday. However, taking the envelope to the post office turned out to be more of a task because Ma always picked her up from the bus stop and never let her go to the market by herself. Then, on the thirteenth day after her twelfth birthday, as the school bus pulled in to her regular drop-spot she saw their domestic help waiting to fetch her. She withdrew the letter from the bag and posted it. Like a superhero preparing to go to battle, she braced herself. This was it.
