Every night, without fail, after cooking the last meal of the day, she took the stairs to the common terrace of her cheap PG accommodation. There, where grief didn't come so cheap, and where the yellow streetlight hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t found ways to undress her the way it gave away random couples under the mango tree, she let her tears dry on throat. Silently. Because if she spoke, it would be considered noise, and noise is nothing but unwanted sound, she had read in Eighth standard Physics book. She did not want to be unwanted sound. In fact, she did not want to be unwanted anything. That is why she waited with fingers wrapped around the five inch screen of her smart phone. The moon, a daily observant of this ritual, wondered who was clinging on to whom between the phone and the woman. As if to return the favour, she wondered if the moon was ever disturbed by the hypocrisy of the world. No one ever asked it if it was happy revolving around the earth on a daily basis. But they did name this doubtful happiness- love, beauty, and the likes.

Assumptions. Followed by Expectations.

When her father had enrolled her in a Sitar class he had assumed that she would see it only as a hobby. He didn't know that the eleven year old Richa, who carried the weight of the sitar with her rickety hands each Sunday to her Sir‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s place, would begin to read about Ragas more than books on noise and its discovery. Much to his bafflement, she got up at five in the morning to rehearse for two hours before school. She began missing tuitions for cultural performances. And on an outrageous Thursday she skipped a class test. It was reported to the parents via the school diary. Under the red sentences her father signed his shame. During parents-teacher meeting, the class teacher informed about dropping grades. With only five months left to the Tenth Board Exams, she was asked to quit practice. Her look was that of an almost lost battle.

‚ÄoeBut studies are much more important, Beta. We are from a middle class family. We cannot afford such luxuries.‚Äù He had placed his hand lovingly on her forehead. ‚ÄoeI work hard so that I can give you the right education. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mock it so!‚Äù

Her Sitar sir had paid a determined visit to convince her father of the talent that he was killing.

‚ÄoeI will take her to Kolkata where she can fine tune her skills. She will be wonderful. Give her a chance.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWill it bring financial security? These things cannot bring you money. I want to see my daughter successful.‚Äù

She had overheard the conversations and stifled her urge. She did not want to mock her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard work, whatever that meant. And to be very honest, she wasn't even sure if she really wanted Sitar as a profession. Would she be happy if the money wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come in easily? What if she succumbed to the struggle? What if she loves playing it, but not so much as to marry it? No one had sat her down to help her with her doubts. But they did tell her what love and beauty should be like.

Sundays were now kept for solving Profit and Loss questions that had definite answers at the back of the chapter.

Time drifted and with it drifted Richa. Tenth, twelfth, engineering, a promising job with Mahindra in Bangalore. And the music that she had entwined her heart with as an eleven year old middle-class-Indian child drifted along. She was elected President of the reputed music club in her college. The office HR requested her to perform on Diwali, Karnataka Rajyotsava and on foundation days. Friends posted her performance pictures on social networking sites. Her music was restricted to garnering likes and comments and dreams. Each day in office made her realise more that the flow of money had clogged her dreams. When she looked back, she saw her doubts of succumbing only as cajolement to make the transition easy. Anoushka Shankar came to Bangalore to perform. Richa sat like a leech through the performance and after it. So when the janitor asked her to leave the vacant hall she began crying. What was she reduced to? Inspiration in lost battles? That night she collected enough strength to call her mother and tell her that she did not want to work anymore. She wanted to play Sitar instead. It had been a devouring night, for her and her parents on the other side of the line. Both parties were worked up with their own insecurities and dreams. Her parents thought that she was still naive, that perhaps it was only hard times in office that was making her talk so, that she did not understand the importance of money in life. She wanted to tell them that she did. She did understand that coming from a poor background, her father had seen what drought of money is like. She understood that her father had worked hard for money so that his children have what he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t- good education, healthy food and a decent roof to protect from sun, rain and people. She wanted the money too, but she wanted it through her passion, through the rhythm in her heart that kept her going. It was an unconventional path, perhaps pregnant with struggle, but the music which had eased her in times of trouble could never betray her. It was a two sided Bollywood love affair.

‚ÄoeFine.‚Äù Her father finally spoke carefully. ‚ÄoeYou want to play Sitar. Do it. You want to make it your profession. Go for it. But do it after marriage. We won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t complain then.‚Äù

The condition came like the Bangalore rain, unseen and unpredicted. She wanted to laugh at the absurdity of such suggestion. It was like telling her to be a parasite in someone else‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s belly and earn individuality.

‚ÄoeBeta, you have anyway reached a marriageable age. Our family and friends keep questioning us at parties and gatherings. It is high time you settle down. Your insecurities at this age are understandable. You need a life partner.‚Äù

‚ÄoeMa, Please!‚Äù

‚ÄoeEither that, or go for higher studies. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a problem. But do something fruitful with your life.‚Äù

She marvelled at her parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> talent at steering conversations. What had started out as a complaint from her had ended up in a complaint from them. Also, the way the option for higher studies was offered to her, like they wanted to tell her that she should be grateful for the opportunity. The call ended with useless goodnights. And so did her argument. Over the months her mother expressed worry and sadness that with each setting sun one prospective groom was lost. She wanted her daughter to learn to drape a sari without creases and cook food with perfectly added salt. Richa found her mother cute at such instances and laughed heartily. But soon her skin began to be branded of questionable age ‚Ä" twenty six- the age at the end of the rickety bridge of independence. Her mother started crying on phone calls, her father began questioning if there was someone else. When she called her relatives on festivals, they asked numerous questions. Cousins younger to her started getting married. Not that she cared, but her parents had a terrible fight one night, a night painted the colour of accusations. The tone on the other side of the line was always of pain and deceit and hurt. She did not want to be the person to hurt them. She pulled out her Sitar, played a random tune from a Bollywood number and thought. Sooner or later she would have to marry. She did not have enough courage to take a decision. She was only extending time, extending hurt. Her Sitar was never coming to the forefront, at least not like this. So when her Fua called up to tell her about a guy she wanted her to meet, Richa said okay. As if this is the button they were waiting to be pressed, the darkness and the silence disappeared from her family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life. Soon the house was like a new television set tuned to high resolution and generous volume. They prepared her bio data, called her home to click as many pictures as they could, got the halls whitewashed and bought a new car too. Variety of people outsourced men from variety of acquaintances. Those men met her over cold coffee in Cafe Coffee Day Lounge and once in an art gallery in Kormangala where Richa spent most of her time staring at the groin of a painted man on a horse. She artfully remarked too and though she was much sadder about the naked man in the painting, she felt bad for her dressed up date too. They come with hopes and expensive perfumes on wrists. I meet them with absolute indifference, wasting their time and emotions. But then for all I care, they could paint me in their living rooms and keep staring. That is what marriage is to me right now. Notes without tune. Noise without music. Painting without the justifying audience. The day she was supposed to meet the fifth man for the second time, because her family liked him and his family a little too much, it rained in Bangalore. It rained with such uncertainty that it seemed as if it wanted to tell something. Richa stood at the window, trying to comprehend its language, observing the pelting drops on leaves of random trees. She felt a kinship with the drops. Random life, random men. And she kept falling. Her mother had called for the third time that day, telling her how to sip her coffee, suggesting which Kurta will look good or just about how much she should reveal about herself. Please do not tell him that you want to turn Sitar into a profession. But do tell him that you play well. That had irritated Richa. What was Sitar? A girlfriend you are ashamed to bring home to your parents? So when her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face beamed on her five inch screen for the fourth time she drowned the ringtone in Anoushka Shankar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s album ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Breathing Under Water.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> She loved the soundtrack ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Slither‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in particular, slithering with its pace, pelting with its force- the passion in her heart burning with a new found flicker. The rain outside danced with the rhythm too. And so did the random leaves. She closed her eyes and remembered the quick patterned drop of fingers of her Sir on the skin of Tabla and the excitement with which her fingers ran on the frets, like a lover in climax, trusting the fire, the passion, this immense energy- rising high, high and higher.

The to-be fianc√© called to tell her that he was waiting at the Lounge for her. She put on the same Kurta that she had worn the first time she met him, applied kajjal and left the rest of her face bare like a barren land with no promise of harvest. At the lounge she complimented his suit-and-tie and sat down to tell that she was late because of an orgasm that she was enjoying. When he choked over air she told him that this new found zeal that day had set things right for her. She would put down her papers, shift to Kolkata to learn from her Sir‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brother who was a renowned Sitarist in India. There was no place for marriage in such crammed up space and time for now, and she definitely did not want him to have false hopes. It ended on a good note. Their handshakes were firm, wishes true. But when Richa got into the taxi, she knew what she had done. She had seeped like unwanted rain into the wall of trust and weakened it. That wall will break anytime now, anytime when her parents hear of her dissent.

Ten days have passed now. The tears of hope dry on her throat. The moon witnesses the charade. She waits for a call from father. She waits to be welcomed back. She waits for the phone call that will assure her that she isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t unwanted. Ma calls to know if she is okay, if she is living. But her father never calls. After waiting for an hour each night she takes the stares back to her room where the Sitar rests on her bed. She picks it up, plays the Bhupali Raga that her father had immediately taken a liking to and looks at the phone. One day he will understand.
