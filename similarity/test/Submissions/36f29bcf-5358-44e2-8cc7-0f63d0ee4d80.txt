‚ÄoeClang.‚Äù A loud clattering sound disturbed the still of the night. Geeta awoke startled and her heart beat fast. A strange sense of fear gripped her as she waited in the dead silence. She strained her eyes at the wall-clock. It was 12:00 midnight. And there it was again ‚ÄoeClang. Clang.‚Äù A thought gripped her ‚ÄoeHe is going to kill us!‚Äù She went cold and began to shiver. With a trembling hand, she shook Mallika ‚ÄoeWake up! Something is terribly wrong. I can hear him downstairs. He is doing something! Wake up.‚Äù Mallika too had heard the sounds. With her heart racing, Mallika sat up. She too had a strange gut feeling that he was going to kill them tonight. Trying to be brave, she told Geeta ‚ÄoeMom, it is OK. Maybe it is just dad throwing some vessels in the sink after dinner.‚Äù But Geeta mumbled ‚ÄoeNo, I feel something bad is going to happen tonight.‚Äù They strained their ears for more sound. Nothing! Somewhere a dog barked in the neighbourhood. There was perfect silence. ‚ÄoeI suppose he went to bed. Let us sleep too.‚Äù Mallika said. She lay down while Geeta continued to sit up. ‚ÄoeCrash‚Äù It was a different sound now. ‚ÄoeThud. Thud. Thud.‚Äù It sounded like something being hammered. Everything seemed very strange. Mallika sat up again and held Geeta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand. Both were trembling and they could hear their hearts pounding against their chests. ‚ÄoeBang.‚Äù They recognised this as the front door banging shut. Pin drop silence‚Ä¶! They wondered what was going on downstairs. They knew Ramesh was downstairs. 

‚ÄoeSplitter.‚Äù Was that the sound of glass shattering? That was absurd. Mallika shook aside her thought and wondered what the sound was. It could not be glass! Why would Ramesh break glass! ‚ÄoeSplitter. Splitter.‚Äù Yes, it was certainly glass. But why was Ramesh smashing glass? What was he doing? What glass was he shattering? Was he breaking the windows of the house? Geeta and Mallika had no clue. ‚ÄoeNidhi, wake up.‚Äù Nidhi just tossed and turned despite Mallika nudging her to wake up. Nidhi was an athlete and had participated in the Sports Day events at her College that day and her tired body was in deep slumber. ‚ÄoeSplitter. Splitter. Splitter.‚Äù They heard the glass from a different side of the house now. How very weird! What was Ramesh up to? 

‚ÄoeClang. Clang.‚Äù Vessels again! ‚ÄoeSplitter. Splitter. Splitter.‚Äù Glass again! "Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud." ‚ÄoeWhat shall we do Mallika? I am very scared. I feel he is going to kill us.‚Äù Geeta‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice shook as she spoke. ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s call the Police, Mom. They are our only hope now. We anyways won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able to do anything about dad‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s situation by ourselves.‚Äù Mustering her every ounce of courage, Mallika took her mobile with trembling fingers saying ‚ÄoeWe will ask them to help us admit him to Leela Mental Hospital.‚Äù Geeta was confused ‚ÄoeBut we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the number of any Police Station!‚Äù Mallika began to fumble with the keypad of her mobile. ‚ÄoeI will search on the internet. Am sure I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll find it there.‚Äù Her fingers were shaking so much that she was not able to even type the correct spelling. Somehow she managed to type ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Shankarpura Police Station‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and it showed a couple of numbers. She dialled one number. ‚ÄoeRing. Ring. Ring. Ring.‚Äù It was 12:25 in the night. Her heart beat fast. ‚ÄoeHello,‚Äù somebody spoke. ‚ÄoeSir, I am talking from J.C. Colony. My dad is smashing glass in the house and throwing vessels and breaking many things. We feel he is going to kill us. Please can you help us?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄoeSee Madam, it is late in the night and we are only two Constables in the Station here. We cannot come now. You come to the Station in the morning and we will look into the matter.‚Äù ‚ÄoePlease Sir! Please‚Ä¶! We will be dead by morning‚Ä¶! Please we need you to come now. Please can you not arrange for more Police to come. Please Sir. I beg of you. This is urgent. My father will kill us. Please Sir.‚Äù He replied ‚ÄoeNo Madam, nothing can be done at this late hour. We cannot find anybody at this hour of the night. You come in the morning.‚Äù ‚ÄoeSir, please. What about other Police Stations in Shankarpura? Where will I find more Police? We need help immediately. My father is going to kill us. Please Sir.‚Äù ‚ÄoeMadam, in every Police Station, only two Constables will be available at this hour of the night. None will be able to come to your house. You somehow manage the night. We will help you in the morning.‚Äù This Policeman did not understand the seriousness of the situation! ‚ÄoeOK Sir‚Äù Mallika reluctantly said and dropped the call. Four people would be dead by morning if timely help was not provided- Geeta, Mallika, Nidhi and the baby in Mallika‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s womb! Mallika was eight months pregnant and had come to her parental home for the delivery of the baby, as is the custom in India. Little did she know that Ramesh was so out of control with progression of age! ‚ÄoeSplitter. Splitter.‚Äù Ramesh continued to break glass downstairs. Geeta was profusely sobbing ‚ÄoeHe is going to kill us. What are we to do?‚Äù 

Mallika pulled herself together. She knew that everything was in her hands now. She refused to give up. It was NOW or NEVER! Fight for dear LIFE or submit to DEATH! Mallika firmly decided that she would keep calling the Police until they agreed to help. She called another Police Station in the same town but there was only one Police Constable there! Despite her every plea for help, it was plainly refused due to lack of personnel. She tried calling another Police Station. There too the situation was the same. After several repeated phone calls to all the three Police Stations, they agreed to help. Finally! By now Nidhi too was awake. At 02:10 AM, the Police arrived. They informed Mallika over phone that they were outside the house but they needed someone to open the front door. Herculean task this was! Who would go downstairs to open the door? Geeta was sobbing and shivering. Mallika was bold but since she was pregnant, Geeta did not allow her to take the risk. Nidhi said she would do it. Mallika agreed to come behind her, followed by Geeta. Mallika reminded that they all wear slippers because there could be glass pieces around, guessing from the sounds they heard. So they wore their slippers and inched their way down the stairs. On reaching the ground floor, what a horrific sight met their eyes! Ramesh was standing with a machette in his hand. The showcases were broken. Broken pieces of the wooden centre table only spoke of Ramesh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s frenzy. The dining table and chairs were beyond recognition as their bits and pieces were spread everywhere. There was glass strewn everywhere on the floor. Broken whisky and beer bottles were also seen all over the floor. There was a pile of clothes burning in a corner. He had even set a bundle of papers on fire. The extent of the damage done by Ramesh was beyond imagination. As they walked, Nidhi saw big colourful fishes jumping on the floor! ‚ÄoeDad! Why did you break my aquarium?‚Äù She bent down to collect the fishes. The aquarium had been her priced possession ever since she was a little girl and she had looked after the fishes with extreme love and care. And here they were strewn on the floor amidst the glass pieces, wriggling for life! Nidhi was lost in her own thoughts ‚ÄoeBring me a bucket of water. I need to save my fishes!‚Äù Mallika realised Nidhi had lost sight of the situation. So she moved ahead and dashed to the door. Geeta gasped ‚ÄoeRamesh! What have you done!‚Äù The Police entered. Ramesh was taken aback by what was happening. He was completely drunk. His eyes looked blood-red. He could hardly maintain his balance. He spoke but his speech was garbled. There were two Police Inspectors and five Police Constables. Four Constables grabbed Ramesh and yanked him outside the front door and into the Police Jeep. The Inspectors and a Constable inspected the house. There was glass everywhere-in the living room, bedrooms, kitchen, everywhere. There were vessels thrown around and various things broken. The house was a shocking mess. They took photographs of the house and told Geeta, Mallika and Nidhi to accompany the Police Constables to Leela Mental Hospital while the Police Inspectors and one Constable moved on. What a night it was! 

Ramesh yelled at everyone and hurled abuses at all. He kept saying ‚ÄoeWhy have you brought me here? What is wrong with me? I am fine! Let me go home!‚Äù The nurses tried to calm him down but it was of no use. Two strong male nurses pinned Ramesh down. He was tied to the bed and the Doctor injected a sedative. After a while, Ramesh dozed off. Everything seemed calm now. Mallika wondered if Ramesh could be admitted permanently in this hospital? For all she could remember, their life had always been marred by Ramesh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Schizophrenia and alcohol. It had been a life of dread, a life of fear, a life of frustration. Could this be the end of their troubles? Could they live a peaceful life hereafter? The Doctor said Ramesh could be kept for only three months, following which they expected the family to ensure that Ramesh took medicines at home. From past experience, numerous attempts of giving medicines to Ramesh had failed miserably. Each time he would fight that he was fine and could take medicines himself. He would end up popping additional pills whenever he felt like or stopping medication whenever he felt like, worsening the situation as the years progressed. Mallika knew that was not the solution. Ramesh was admitted for now. 

A permanent solution was required. Mallika searched online and began making phone calls to various Rehabilitation Centres and Care Homes in various parts of the country. Most replied that they provided treatment for only a short duration and expected the family to take the patient back after that. That was certainly not a feasible option. The scene looked dim but Mallika frantically searched for a permanent solution. She finally found a Care Home in another part of the country. Arrangements were made. Ramesh was sedated and taken to the Care Home in an ambulance. He was admitted there. Fear gripped Geeta. Would Ramesh escape from there? Would he return? What would happen if he returned? The Care Home had assured them that security was tight and no inmates were allowed out. It was decided that the Care Home would immediately call Mallika if at any time Ramesh managed to escape. 

Geeta, Mallika and Nidhi had to spend the next few days cleaning the mess at home. As Geeta was changing the bedsheets, she froze. There under the pillow were three knives. These were not knives from the kitchen. These were new knives. Their intuition was indeed right that Ramesh had made plans to kill them that night! Geeta sat down and began to sob. Mallika began to search around for more knives. Three more were found on a rack of clothes, neatly hidden under a shirt. Nidhi searched the cupboard. There were another three knives there. On opening a table drawer, Nidhi found three knives. Geeta and her daughters were speechless. 

‚ÄoeRing. Ring. Ring.‚Äù The call was from the Care Home.
