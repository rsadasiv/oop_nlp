THE ACTOR By Anupa Mehta 

Dhiren Patel wanted to be an actor from as far back as he can recall. His deep desire to be applauded on stage and celebrated on screen may stem from the fact that his mother, who died in 1978, was a veteran theatre actress on the Gujarati theatre firmament in an era when few middle-class Gujarati women would have considered stepping out of the restrictive cocoon of extended joint families. 

Aneelaben Patel nee Shah, Dhiren Patel's mother, was different. In her heyday - we speak of the early `60s - Aneelaben was among few women in India to be recognized as an actress non *pareil*. Mostly, as she set the Gujarati stage ablaze with her fiery roles in theatricals like *Chandramukhi *and *Ek Stree Ni Atmakatha,* strongly etched plays with women oriented themes. 

Recalling his mother's colorful life and her feted oeuvre during the course of an interview with a popular Gujarati weekly, Dhiren Patel, now in his late 40s and used to basking in reflected glory, said: "*Aam-to*, it could be said that the plays she acted in, and her own personal life were both *ra-ther* ahead of the times. Mummy was an inspiration to us all. She came from a simple, lower middle-class Gujarati family and had no formal education, but she was very determined and blazed a trail with her acting prowess. I am indebted to her for what she taught me without actually teaching me." 

The young reporter, floored by Dhiren Patel's own flamboyance, had gone back and filed a gushy but factually incorrect story about the "dashing" character actor and his loving relationship with his late mother, "the progressive Aneelaben Patel of Bombay's *bhangwadi *theatre". 

Truth though is quite removed from the saccharine tone of the article. The hyperbole that characterizes the lives of individuals, whom life turns into stars posthumously, is often embarrassing: the fact is that Aneelaben died virtually in penury following her husband's death, supported only by her lover's abject devotion even in old age. In his darkest moments Dhiren Patel simply hates his mother with a deep vengeance for her avant-garde life choices. Choices which left him and the man he refers to as his elder brother with a deep sense of un-belonging. 

Ravishankar Joshi, Aneelaben's lover, a theatre director of impressive caliber was so smitten by the young Aneela's stage presence and charisma even in run-of-the-mill productions that he actually took to writing plays with her in mind. The attraction between them was instantaneous and intense: their relationship turned out to be intellectually and emotionally vibrant, growing stronger each day. 

The news of this unconventional affair spread across theatre circles in no time. But Aneelaben didn't balk in the face of censure from colleagues or her conservative relatives, who were aghast at the young actress's brazenness, and the fact that she flaunted an older lover so openly, despite having a 5-year old son, Suresh, from her husband with whom she had an arranged marriage, and whom she continued to live with. 

Aneelaben was forthright enough to bring her married lover home. Her husband, Rashesh Patel, a small time trader who was in absolute awe of his wife's persona, was unable to utter even a single word in protest. Over the years, it became an accepted, even a respected truth, that Aneelaben and Ravishankar Joshi were soul mates, inseparable and inexplicably bound by a strange, call it karmic even, bond. 

Ravishankar eventually left his wife and children for Aneelaben, even though divorces were quite unheard of in those days. The fascinating thing about this ménage-a-trois was that Aneelaben's husband actually accepted his wife's lover: in fact, at one point, Ravishankar Joshi, having nowhere to live, was even allowed to move into Rasheshbhai and Aneelaben's marital home. Dhiren was born a year later. Quite automatically he took on Rashesh Patel's surname. 

Rasheshbhai, to his credit, managed the home and reared both boys in the best possible manner in their mother's absence, given her erratic work and travel schedules. Over the years Rasheshbhai became more and more withdrawn, as if ailing silently from an unmentionable illness. Simply put, he was heart-sick: his love for his wife was so overpowering that he just chose to quell his inner voice in the face of her blatant love affair with her mentor. He passed away quietly in his sleep when Dhiren was 19. Dhiren and Suresh, already in his mid 20s and engaged to a sweet Gujarati girl Meeta, parted ways with their mother a little after Rasheshbhai's death, due to irrevocable differences and a complete breakdown in communication. 

Both young men moved out of their childhood home in a chawl in central Mumbai, following an ugly altercation with their strong-willed mother who maintained her position towards her lover, insistent that he be treated on par with the man whose surname they carried. 

It was something that Suresh and Dhiren were not entirely comfortable with. As young boys they had unquestionably accepted the situation at home. Ravishankar Kaka was just that: they saw him as an uncle who lived with them and who directed their mother in her plays. But as they grew and friends began insinuating things, the boys too began to feel the need to question their willful mother. Aneelaben however deigned to explain her position or her choices to either her sons or the world at large. She remained committed to the man she loved till the day she died, even at the cost of her relationship with her sons in her later years. 

The two young men decided then that they would move out and stay together in a rented flat in the suburbs of Mumbai. Suresh, an accountant with a large firm, married his fiancé, while Dhiren, already taking ambitious steps in the acting business, embarked upon a tumultuous relationship with Anjali Vakil, a young and voluptuous actress whose presence was making her presence felt, quite strongly, in theatre circles. 

As time passed, Ravishankar Kaka kept the boys informed about their mother's ailing state and one day, when she was critical, he beseeched them to forgive both of them and be by her bedside. And so it came to pass that both boys were with their mother when she died, her hand clasping her lover's tightly. Seeing the old man breakdown and weep like a baby over Aneelaben's body, Suresh found himself reaching out to support the old man, who 

was neither kith nor kin to him. Yet, someone who remained inextricably bound to the sons of the woman he loved. 

Ironically, after their mother died, Ravishankar had nowhere to go, as the house Aneelaben had lived in was rented, and he had no money at all. It was then that Suresh convinced Dhiren about the need to do the right thing, regardless of all the unanswered questions following them like a skunk's tale. Reluctantly, Dhiren agreed. Suresh's wife, Meeta, took to the old man, secretly admiring him for his fearless and unshakeable love for her dead mother-in-law. 

Unable to quell the buzz of questions that circled in his head every day that he faced Ravishankar Joshi, who he bore a striking resemblance to, Dhiren soon married Anjali Vakil and moved into her apartment. It seemed to him the easiest way to move away from his immediate past and the niggling, soul-wrenching doubts that he carried about his own paternity and thereby, his relationship with the man that he considered his brother. As for Ravishankar Joshi, Dhiren had simply blocked him out of his visage: it was a truth that he preferred to not acknowledge, given his mother had never confirmed it while she was alive. 

Life with Anjali, on the other hand, was heady. She wore bright coloured saris, large American diamond jewelry and overtly 

bright lipsticks and bindis, a loud contrast to his mother's sober ethnic taste and Meetabhabhi's simple synthetic saris. Anjali was also the life of the party, so to speak. Her parties became talked about, as the who's who of the theatre world made it to the penthouse flat that she shared with Dhiren, who had begun an export import business to keep the home fires burning. 

Dhiren's business grew in proportion to Anjali's fame. Soon, overcome by the desire to become a wealthy man, he began taking speculative risks. Until one day he lost an unbelievably large sum of money. Overnight, creditors began haunting him, leaving him feeling even more wretched and demeaned than ever before. Anjali's career was doing well, and so she took over the bills, a fact that both she and Dhiren found very difficult to deal with. 

Dhiren Patel doesn't reveal these aspects of his life or his mother's life story to too many people. He simply paints a warm and plausible picture for those who ask, like he did for the young journalist who went out and wrote just the sort of story that would get him good press. It was only during an intense session with his hypnotherapist, a man who insisted on injecting his clients with a mild dose of what he called his "truth serum" that Dhiren Patel came out with the fact that he was about 9 when he chanced upon his mother and Ravishankar in a compromising position in his parents marital bed. Taken aback at seeing his beautiful mother in the embrace of a man who was, for all practical purposes, her professional mentor and a relative, he backed out of the room quietly and retreated into a fragile but hard-to-break shell. It only cracked open many, many years later, when his wife, now a famous television star, taunted him and said that he was "an incapable bastard who could neither act as he claimed, or earn a living, nor satisfy a woman." 

That was when bile arose in Dhiren Patel's gut. For the first time in his life, he felt angry enough to land a hard blow across his wife's overly made-up plump face, which crumpled under the force of the slap. It was the proverbial straw that broke their marriage which, despite 15 odd years of a troubled married life, fraught as it was with ego problems and their dual megalomania, had held. Anjali Vakil walked out that evening with their young daughter. The next day, Dhiren packed his bags, rang Anjali and asked her to return from her mother's, saying he was moving out of her flat. 

That was in 1987. From 1987 to 1997, Dhiren Patel worked hard to pay back his creditors, turning what he instinctively knew - acting - into a partially lucrative career. He landed bit parts in several Bollywood films and Gujarati plays. During this 

period, he moved several times due to the fact that he was unable to afford the rents in posh neighborhoods for very long. 

Reluctant to go back and live with Ravishankar Joshi and Suresh, he stuck it out through the vagaries of filmdom, engaging with innumerable starlets and star stuck film aspirants in a bid to retrieve and puff up his dwindling manhood. He even tried new age healing therapies, besides a regular dosage of sedatives and anti-depressants, prescribed by his hypnotherapist who was actually unable to fathom what really ailed Dhiren Patel. But nothing seemed to help. The monster gnawing at his insides was just too large and out of control. It was akin to an amoebic creature that continuously beamed images on the screen of his mind that he didn't quite care to see. 

When he wasn't shooting, which, increasingly, was more often than not, he would sit in his balcony and stare at the moist branches of a pregnant orange Gulmohar that hung low just outside the building he lived in with Avantika, his latest girlfriend, an aspiring TV actress who had a rich father. Watching her pirouette in front of the mirror in his bedroom, dressed in loud and flashy clothes, he was reminded of Anjali, his wife who still continued to refuse him a divorce till he was able to make a substantial settlement. Dhiren Patel did not have the courage to tell Avantika that she needed to lose weight and enroll in a grooming course if her ambitions were ever to be fulfilled. 

But since he was overwhelmed by her devotion towards him and she paid half the rent, he kept quiet. Keeping quiet in any case was second nature to all the men in his family. But very often he felt terribly stifled by Avantika's matronly demeanor towards him. The more she fawned over him, the more he strayed. He still owed several people substantial sums of money, but had no answers left for those who ring him sporadically in the hope that they would be able to recoup at least a portion of the money he owed. 

The other thing gnawing at him in those days was the fact that a small-town newspaper in Porbunder had run a story about Ravishankar Joshi's return to a home for the aged in his hometown in the wake of being "abandoned by Suresh and Dhiren," the sons of his late lady-love. It was not a pleasant news item. The newspaper had in fact taken a harmless situation - Ravishankar was to stay with his relatives while Suresh and his wife had moved to Canada for a few years, but had landed up in a home for old persons out of choice - and made it into a tragic and sensational melodrama. What irked Dhiren was the fact that the writer had wondered why Dhiren Patel, now separated from the glamorous Anjali Vakil, not thought it fit to have the old man 

stay with him, given the very real ties that existed between them. 

Throwing the paper down in disgust, Dhiren was aghast to realize that without stating it in so many words the journalist had implied that Ravishankar Joshi was indeed Dhiren's real father. Finally, the one skeleton that he had sought to bury within the cupboards of his psyche was out, dangling in the open. Finally someone had articulated in a single line what Dhiren had been striving to do for him over four decades. 

Unable to handle his chaotic thoughts or the bad press, a heavily sedated Dhiren Patel made a quick trip to Porbunder. Reaching the home for the aged, where Ravishankar Joshi was said to be, he ignored the buzz of surprise from the staffers on duty. Armed with directions, he quietly climbed up three flights of old chipped mosaic clad steps to where the old man sat forlornly on a wicker chair in a common passageway overlooking an unkempt garden. In what seemed even to him, a scene right out of a Hindi film, Dhiren walked towards him and sat down in front of Ravishankar and stared at him squarely for the first time in his life. 

In the ensuing silence, both men gazed at each other for a very long time. In the old man's gaze, Dhiren saw only himself. And fleetingly, the many faces of his mother. It was as if 

Ravishankar Joshi's fading grey eyes were confirming to him what he had always sensed. Still, not a word was exchanged between the two men. After a long while, Ravishankar whispered to Dhiren, "I just love Aneela. That's all. She is my life breath." 

Listening to the old man speak thus of his mother, as if in present tense, Dhiren was overcome by a moral conflict. In that instance, much against his will, Dhiren too felt what Suresh had felt so many years ago, and he too put his hands out and held the old man, awkwardly patting his shoulder. Reassuring him as one would a young child. That day Ravishankar Joshi cried for the second time in his life. After an hour of sitting beside him listening to his child-like sobs, Dhiren decided to take the old man back with him to the rented flat that Avantika and he shared in a far flung suburb of Mumbai. 

That was three years ago. During those three years, Avantika moved out. Dhiren and Ravishankar bonded in an astonishing manner, cracking jokes, playing gin rummy, sharing their daily quota of whiskey and just living in camaraderie that neither had known for so many decades. 

A year later, Dhiren Patel won a national award in the category of best supporting actor. Ravishankar was in the audience along with Suresh and Meeta. Post the ceremony, emerging out of the auditorium with the old man, Dhiren bumped into a famous actor 

who stopped to congratulate him. Dhiren introduced Ravishankar to the actor saying, "Thank you Sir. It's all in the genes. This is my father." And the old man's eyes twinkled with glee as he smiled at the actor. 

Looking at the joy on the old man's face Dhiren thought to himself that sometimes the most complicated things are far simpler than one thinks them to be. And the things we ache to hear remain mostly unsaid.
