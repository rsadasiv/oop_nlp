*Biographical Sketch: * 

I was born in Kerala to an Anglo-Indian family. My Dad gave me a German sounding name that people till date have difficulty pronouncing. I grew up and did my schooling in a small town called Bhopal. And finally, till date I have paid rent in three diagonally different cities - Pune, Delhi and Mumbai.  I am also Creative Director in an Advertising agency and as there is limit to the number of times you can invent a story to sell coconut oil - I turn to writing short stories to keep my storytelling gene, honest and pure. 

******* 

*Story: SOFA* 

It was a nice sofa. Weighing around 30 kilos and made from the finest quality Burma teak, it was a wedding gift for Mr. Iqbal from his father-in-law - who believed he did a splendid job in finding a government-employed groom for his dear daughter. The sofa itself was part of larger furniture set, which comprised of two chairs, one tea table, a sturdy bed and an almirah. Nearly everything a newly wed needed to rest their boson and to start a new life. At the time of his wedding Mr. Iqbal was a junior accountant in a government bank. Nothing fancy, but a definite dealmaker if you are a middle-class Indian bachelor, all set to settle down with a nice, homely girl from a conservative family. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s exactly why when Mr. father-in-law heard the words, ‚ÄoeJunior Accountant‚Äù he knew he has found the Groom. Didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter that the guy was still in probation and only earned enough to make ends meet. Blind optimism and faith in the benevolence of Government of India assured him that this is the guy. 

So, carrying a kilogram of [1] <#m_7966890740146220105__ftn1>desi ghee sweetmeat, neatly packed in a glittering box, Mr. father-in-law visited the Iqbal household with the marriage proposal. A rapidly aging mother answered the door. She was expecting him. He introduced himself and handed over the box of sweetmeat. She thankfully accepted it and welcomed him in. Now either Iqbal household practiced minimalistic living or having home furniture was a crime in their part of the town - because the living room was nearly empty. It was sans any kind of furniture. The only thing that was standing on four legs was a steel chair. And the mother politely offered him its comfort. Mr. father-in-law looked around the vacant space confused and then sat down. Wealth was never a selection criteria but this was borderline poverty. He started having second thoughts. Did he make up his mind way too early? Where will his daughter sit and cut vegetables? Where will he sit, if and when he came down for a visit? How would his relatives and cousins react? Probably, he should check out a few more prospective grooms. A ringing doorbell interrupted his train of thoughts. The aging mother opened the door and in came a handsome young lad, the soon-to-be groom - Mr. Iqbal. Seeing him enter, Mr. father-in-law got up and the two men shook hands. He was impressed seeing a young, handsome lad with firm handshake. But the empty room came back to haunt him. He once again occupied the steel chair, while Mr. Iqbal made himself comfortable on the floor. They exchanged some clich√©d pleasantries and then went mute. Mr. father-in-law looked at him and thought, ‚ÄoeThis man is going to bed my daughter. But I wonder whether he even owned a bed.‚Äù Mr. Iqbal somehow read his thoughts and smiled. It was a special kind of smile. Just the kind you get when you are sitting in a mathematics exam and a really tough question appears, and everybody is about to faint or vomit, but you had anticipated this scenario and had prepared well. So you look around, smile, wait for the question to seep in, savor the moment, make the question grovel for the answer and then call Ammi and say, ‚ÄoeAmmi, the bank has made me a permanent employee.‚Äù 

Hearing this Mr. Father‚Ä"in-law nearly jumped to hug him. This was the sweetest piece of news his eardrum had heard in a long, long time. He said to himself, ‚ÄoeA son-in-law with a permanent government job in a government bank, what more can I ask for my daughter. As for the missing furniture, I will take care of it.‚Äù 

And so he did and so it happened - Mr. Iqbal got Mrs. Iqbal and along with her a well furnished house. Their life as a couple began and the Sofa became the busiest piece of furniture in the house. Everything revolved around it. Mr. Iqbal, who has now graduated to being called Abbu sat on it to tie and untie his shoelaces. Mrs. Iqbal or Ammi sat on it to cut vegetables. And guests sat on it to discuss politics, prices, births, deaths and every conceivable mundane event, which the middle class so loves to discuss. Not once did the sofa complain about accommodating a four member family or let out a squeal, even when it became six. Every other piece of the furniture gave in to time, termites or coitus - but the Sofa prevailed. It endured years of angry dusting, unnecessary moving, occasional jumping and impromptu lovemaking. Not once did it complain. The only visible sign of aging were the three buttock marks embossed on the on the fabric and the accompanying curvy dent on the mattress. Minus these, it was a long-standing, skillfully crafted, faithful piece of wood. 

****** 

The leaves have begun to ruffle early. It was barely March. The clock read 6.30 a.m and like every other day Abbu was the first one to get up. He quietly got up, rubbed his eyes and sat on the corner of the bed. He sat there motionless for good five minutes. Then he turned around and looked at Ammi sleeping peacefully. Her lungs gracefully sucked in oxygen, while her nose silently dispensed carbon dioxide ‚Ä" just the way God intended. He smiled in his mind and turned back towards the dark room. His bare feet moved around on the cold floor looking for the rubber sleepers. On finding them he got up, fastened his checkered lungi and proceeded to the living room. The living room was expectedly dark. Some amount of streetlight did filter through the window curtain. But it was dark. Abbu found his way in the darkness and slowly walked towards the curtains. He gently parted it to look for the newspaper. It had not yet arrived. The porch was empty. Anyways he already knew the headlines. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been eighteen hours, since a bunch of Muslim fanatics had burned a train compartment carrying Hindu pilgrims. Their Hindu fanatic brothers wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to waste this opportunity to teach every Muslim a lesson. 

Abbu sat himself down and started talking to himself, ‚ÄoeWe don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need to worry about anything. We have seen this before. We have been living in this colony for 25 years. No one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to harm us. We have never done any wrong. We are unlike those fanatics; we are educated, salaried and liberal. We celebrate Diwali and give donations for Navratri. My conscience is clear. We have nothing to be afraid of‚Äù, thinking this he leaned back and closed his eyes. In uncertain times clich√©s are the best source of comfort. Nonetheless, a seemingly loud thud startled him. He jumped out of the sofa and slowly walked towards the door. It was way too early for the stone throwers he thought. He again cautiously parted the curtain and peeked. Lying on the cemented porch was the folded newspaper. Abu smiled, his nervous silly smile comforted him a little. 

He kept staring at the folded newspaper and thought, ‚ÄoeShould I go out and pick it up. Or just leave it there. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting bright. At times like these it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s better to practice restrain and be sparsely seen. But then the bowl moment only kicks in after reading through the editorial section. I will quickly go out and pick it up. No one would see.‚Äù So Abbu slowly opened the door, looked around and walked towards the newspaper. He bended down to pick it up and heard someone calling him name. 

Iqbal Sahib‚Ä¶ 

Abbu froze, only to defrost the very next moment on hearing the words, ‚ÄoeGood morning‚Äù. The familiar voice of the next-door neighbor, Mr. Kohli sounded so soothing that he felt warm inside. He picked up the newspaper and greeted Mr. Kohli, who was busy doing some sort of Yoga. Once again Abbu looked around and then started walking back. Suddenly a worthy caution popped up in his head. The house nameplate - it read ‚ÄoeIqbal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s‚Äù and also had the names of his two sons and daughter engraved on it. As a precaution, he thought he should remove the nameplate. Rioters usually come from other neighborhoods. The nameplate would just spell out the location of a Muslim family in a Hindu locality ‚Ä" ‚ÄoeWhy take any chance? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s better to be prudent. I can always put it back tomorrow or later. But what would the children think? It just might unnecessarily scare them? I will hide it somewhere. But what if a courier guy or a postman comes looking for the house. May be I should check with the children first. But then it will be too late. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s getting brighter by the seconds. I might as well do it. Thinking this, he quickly went in and bought a handy screwdriver. He walked towards the iron-gate, unlocked it and stepped out on the main road. There was hardly anyone on the street. He quickly removed the nameplate and carried it in. Walking back, he avoided Mr. Kohli and on his part Mr. Kohli acted oblivious. As Abbu carried the nameplate and the newspaper inside, Mr.Kohli saw a slightly slouched neighbor, who was tired of carrying the weight of his name and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s repercussions. 

****** 

By the time Abbu came back in, Ammi was up and preparing tea. He quietly hid the nameplate behind the sofa and went straight for the editorial section. A dense somber mood prevailed in the house. Everything seemed muted. Even the utensils weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t making any noise. The silence acted like a safety shield and everyone felt safe inside it. 

But Arif, the elder son‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mobile phone had different plans. An SMS arrived and the cell phone started humming a Beethoven classic. He unlocked the phone and read the message. It was his boss, 

‚ÄoeTake the day off. The city is tense. Call if you need any help.‚Äù 

Arif locked the phone back and switched on the television. He went straight to the news channel. The eighteen-hour old news was still being broadcasted as breaking news. The images of a charred train bogie - smoke gushing out of the windows and the flames blackening everything in sight. Horror was packaged, edited, color corrected and dramatized so that more horror could be created. Abbu, now back after successfully emptying his bowl, took the remote from Arif and switched off the television. By now even Shagufta and Musheer were up. Shagufta, the daughter was the youngest of the lot, while Musheer was still in college. Seeing that both her father and elder brothers were up, Shagufta went straight to the kitchen to help Ammi. 

The milk was already simmering when Shagufta entered the kitchen. Ammi had still not added tealeaves into it. Shagufta picked up the tealeaf jar and threw in two spoonful of extra-strong tea. The simmering milk turned volcanic. She quickly lowered the flame and started stirring it. Ammi checked the wall clock - it read 8.30 a.m. Time for breakfast tea and some homemade toast. The two ladies arrived carrying a tray full of teacups and toast. Again not a single word was uttered. Ammi quietly poured tea into the empty teacups. Everyone picked their respective teacups and started sipping quietly. Even Abbu, who usually preferred slurping to sipping, and had been reprimanded on many occasions, obediently sipped tea, without making any noise. 

Breakfast got over in flat fifteen minutes. Time was in a mood to take it slow. So the Iqbal household waited. The ladies got busy with cleaning and preparing lunch. While the men, stared at the clock, switched television channels and reread old newspapers. 

This languid pace was once again broken when the doorbell rang. It was Santosh - the laundry guy. He was smiling sunny holding a bundle of nicely washed and ironed clothes. Arif let him in and he kept his bundle down. Unknotted it and started counting the clothes. Twenty-three in all, he said. Then he made the entry in his diary and got up to leave. But then he stopped, pondered for a second and said, 

*‚ÄoeSir if you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind, can you please clear the month‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s due today itself. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a request.‚Äù   * 

It was an untimely request because Santosh always used to collect his dues at the end of the month ‚Ä" unless of course there was an emergency or festival or he needed extra cash. 

‚ÄoeOf course, Santosh‚Äù said Arif, ‚ÄoeHope it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not an emergency. Wait I will get you the cash. How much is it anyways?‚Äù 

Santosh once again opened his diary to answer that question. He looked for the letter ‚ÄoeI‚Äù and reached Iqbal. He added up all the previous dues and arrived at final figure. But before he could spill out the amount, he looked around the house and again went pondering. He has been washing, ironing and delivering their clothes for more than a decade. He has witnessed the family grow, seen the shirt size expand from small to large, misplaced a dozen [2] <#m_7966890740146220105__ftn2>Sarees and three [3] <#m_7966890740146220105__ftn3>Shervanis. And lastly, nursed a crush on Mrs. Iqbal for ten long years - The name Iqbal was a permanent entry in his diary. He was a witness to their being, a reliable reference check. If someday, some author were to pen a biography titled, ‚ÄoeIqbal Lived Here‚Äù, he would be a goldmine of information. So much memory just cannot be disregarded. So much of time invested in knowing, loving, hating, caring and witnessing a family ‚Ä" cannot just add up to a certain monthly due. There has to be some kind of permanency. Thinking this Santosh stood quiet for a good five minutes. Arif who was standing, holding his wallet wondered what kind of drug-induced trance has he entered. He called his name and Santosh snapped back into reality. He once again looked at Arif, then at Abbu, Musheer, Ammi and Shagufta and said, 

‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ok Son. Nobody is going anywhere. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. Nothing is going to change. I will come back tomorrow. Everything will remain the way it is. Everything will be fine. Money is no big deal.‚Äù 

Saying this, he turned and hurriedly left the house. Arif stood there holding his wallet. Ammi got busy picking up teacups, while a slightly slouched Abbu smiled despairingly and lied down on the sofa.  He closed his eyes and chose to indulge in some warm nostalgia. 

***** 

Abbu lied down on the sofa and hard pressed the rewind button to travel back in time. He started a monologue - 

‚ÄoeI still remember the day Mrs. Iqbal came home along with all the furniture. Truth be told, the house was only big enough to accommodate one of them. I realized this when the bedroom door adamantly refused to allow the new master bed in. No matter how much we tried or in which angle we tilted it, the considerably small door just wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t allow the master bed in. Defeated I decided to dismantle it in the living room and then again assemble it back in bedroom. But that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help either, because now we couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t close the bedroom door. The length of the bed would block the sides of the door from closing. It was a newlywed‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nightmare. It was like my father-in-law was playing a practical joke on me ‚Ä" You shall wed my daughter, but you won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able bed her. So after sweating for few hours, my will gave in and we ended up sleeping on the bed with the door wide open. The sleep was fine but the night was ordinary. A few days passed by and my father-in-law came to visit us. Just a customary visit to check on his daughter, has she settled down well, is she coming fine and stuff like that. I welcomed him in and he comfortably parked himself on the Sofa he paid for. A feeling of contentment, of a job well done took over his face. We chatted about the marriage ceremony, the food and the guests. Soon his newly wed daughter joined us with a tray of tea. He took a sip and then enquired about the rest of furniture ‚Ä" whether the almirah was sufficient enough? How‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the tea table and was the bed sturdy? On hearing the word ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Bed‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, I stole a glance at my wife and said, ‚ÄoeIt is good. Quite sturdy.‚Äù Hearing this he went on a self -congratulatory spree and gave a 3-minute lecture on how much time, money and effort goes in making good quality furniture - specially a sturdy bed. I kept nodding my head and looked at my wife. She seemed to be pleading with her eyes, asking her dad to stop. Finally, my father-in-law did stop, but requested, a show of the bed. I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have said no. I mean here was a man who paid for the bed and he had all the right to have a look at it. So I happily agreed and escorted him to the bedroom. He entered the wide-open bedroom, gleefully inspected the bed, sat on it, patted the mattress a few time and looked at me and smiled. Then the open door caught his attention. Filled with doubt, he slowly got up and held the door. He pulled the door to shut it. But before one half of the door could meet the other half and do its job, the arrogant fourth leg of the bed stopped it from fulfilling it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daily destiny. The glee turned into glum. An embarrassingly deep void of silence appeared. I could sense that he was desperately trying to fill that void with a viable excuse. Nothing appeared. So he walked quietly out of the bedroom, parked himself on the sofa, quietly finished his tea and left. 

The arrogant leg of the bed had trampled his ego. I had a bad feeling about it. And it became true the next day. My father-in-law again reappeared the next day with a new proposal - this time to buy us a new, bigger house. I politely declined. He persisted and told me about a new upcoming neighborhood, with streetlights and concrete road. He knew someone, who knew someone in the registrar office, who knew someone in housing board office and through him got to know about the city‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new master plan. The new proposed colony was part of the new master plan. My father-in-law suggested that I buy 60 X 40 piece of land and build a nice house. The news is not yet out, so we can buy it before the price shoots up. It sounded like a decent proposition. But the money question still remained unanswered. He decided to help. I said no - a six-piece furniture set was enough (I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sit through another lecture on how much time, money and effort goes into building a new house.) So he reworded the offer and said, ‚ÄoeI will only loan you the money and you can pay me back in installments.‚Äù 

I nodded and sat quiet. In all honestly, my father-in-law was not a man of patience. So he further blurted out, ‚ÄoeIn your own sweet time. Return the money in your own sweet time.‚Äù 

I just couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fathom it ‚Ä" how could he feel so sorry for buying me an oversized bed that now he wants to compensate it by buying me a new house. 

I stopped nodding and seriously started giving it a thought. By all means, we weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t living in a posh locality. It was more of a middle-class community ghetto, with muddy roads and roadside stalls. The plan was to sell off this crumbling house and move out of the locality in a few years time. But there is nothing that said that we couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t move now. While these thoughts took shape in my head, my silent pondering was too much for my father-in-law to bear. So he went ahead and dropped a cherry on top of my cake. 

‚ÄoeI am saying - you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even need to sell off this house. Let it remain the way it is. Rent it out to some family or keep it locked. In this way you won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need to even look for a rented accommodation while the new house is being built. So it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decided, you are going to move to Sangam colony.‚Äù Saying this he took my hand and started shaking till it turned blue. And I smiled in my mind. 

And so Iqbal mansion came into being ‚Ä" Three bedrooms, three toilets, one living room, one kitchen and a small garden. The first thing my father-in-law did after building the house was to personally transport the bed. He doubly made sure that the master bedroom was big enough to accommodate the bed. The look on his face when he closed the bedroom door after placing the bed was precious. Finally his job was done. Now his daughter can sleep in peace and so will he. I too on my part made sure that his investment bore results ‚Ä" Arif, the eldest one was born exactly nine months after we moved into Iqbal mansion. 

Remembering this Abbu chuckled a little and looked at the clock. It read, 10.30 a.m. Time was in no hurry to move. So he went back to Arif being born exactly nine months after they had moved to Iqbal mansion. 

‚ÄoeIt was 1978, when we moved in. Twenty-five years have passed. Long enough for people, weather, prices and beliefs to change. But then who knew? We were the first one to move in here. Forget about neighbors, we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even have water connection back then. Just open fields and lots of grass. Then slowly things started filling up. Neighbors, their neighbors, new friends, roads and streetlight ‚Ä" year on year it became livelier. I still remember, when Arif was in 5th standard. That year, on Eid, instead of hiring a [4] <#m_7966890740146220105__ftn4>Khansama, Ammi decided [5] <#m_7966890740146220105__ftn5>to cook the Biryani herself. And what Biryani it was. The aroma travelled far 

and fast. Everyone came in to wish us, even passing strangers. By afternoon, it became so crowded, that people were standing in the porch and savoring biryani. Our own relatives had no place to sit. 

It was a nightmare. But no one complained. The entire neighborhood had turned up. Even the vegetarians ‚Ä" Jain Shaab came in to check on the recipe. Later on he asked Mrs. Jain to cook veg biryani using the same ingredients. It was a day worth living. I wonder whether so many people would turn up today? 

But then twenty-five years is a long time ‚Ä" long enough to watch a hundred year old Mosque being bought down live on national TV. That year we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sacrifice the Goat in our shed. Haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t done since then. Why unnecessary? 

Anyways, old wounds itch a lot. 

We should have moved back to a safer locality. Our locality. But Kohli and Shah wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t listen. And we stayed. That too happened a long time ago. Now Shah is long gone and Kohli is waiting to get a heart attack. 

****** 

After a prolonged wait, afternoon arrived. The clock punctually announced its arrival. At that precise moment, when the minute hand crossed over the pm section, a rather preposterous notion appeared in Abbu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind. Somehow he came to believe that if the afternoon passes away peacefully, then nothing outward would happen. After that everything will be fine. Tempers will cool down. People will start thinking rationally. Life would go back to being happily monotonous and he will go back to slurping tea. 

The notion lasted for exactly 3 minutes because Arif happen to part the curtains to check for miscreants and was shocked to see a crowd of thirty men standing in front of the house. Too stunned to speak. He remained quiet for a while, then turned around and looked at Abbu. Abbu read his eyes and asked, 

‚ÄoeSo, how many of them have turned up?‚Äù 

Arif once again peeked out and said, ‚ÄoeThe entire neighborhood.‚Äù 

The notion had no chance. The glass has been broken. Arif quickly gestured Ammi and Shagfuta to go into the bedroom. They both had already started sobbing. Arif cautiously walked towards the main door. He partially opened the door and saw a crowd of mixed age standing in front of the main gate. Some wearing saffron bandana, but thankfully no one was carrying a sword. Someone from the crowd saw Arif peeking from behind the door and started chanting slogans. Soon the crowd joined in. 

*‚ÄoeHinduo Key Hatyaaro. Pakistan Jao.‚Äù / The Killers of Hindus go to Pakistan.  * 

The collective sloganeering got livelier when someone from the crowd threw a brick at the glass window and broke it. The sound of shattering glass startled everyone one. The entire family was shocked. Ammi and Shagufta started wailing and locked themselves inside the bedroom. Abbu got really tense. This could get really ugly. He had heard way too many communal horror stories. Even the sloganeering picked up. It became even more venomous. 

*‚ÄoeEk ka Badla Sau Sey Lengey.  * 

Aaj Tumhey Bhoon Dengey‚Äù 

*A hundred Muslim will die for killing a Hindu, * 

*Today is the day you shall burn. * 

And many such spine-chilling slogans were now being shouted with a lot of urgency. Arif picked up his cell phone and dialed the local police station. The number was engaged. All the three men looked at each other and wondered what to do. Suddenly they realized that the sloganeering has subsided. The crowd has suddenly hushed up. Arif cautiously walked towards the door and once again parted the door. What he saw shocked him. A smaller bunch of people from the crowd, mostly comprising of elders, firebrand youngsters and the politicians were in a huddle, discussing maybe the next course of action ‚Ä" should we burn them along with the house or should we hack them first. What would be more cheaper and effective ‚Ä" petrol or kerosene? Someone should go to their backyard and guard it, incase they try to escape from the kitchen - they must be busy discussing these and many more such strategically pertinent scenarios thought Arif. 

The huddle broke up after a few minutes and the leader came close to the main gate and yelled 

*‚ÄoeIqbal Sahab come out. We just want to talk to you.‚Äù * 

When Abbu heard his name being called he knew it was time for him to get off the sofa. He calmly got up and started walking towards the main door. Seeing this Ammi ran towards him to stop. He told her to calm down and gestured Arif to open the door and accompany him. He came out on the porch and saw a crowd big enough to rundown his house in seconds. He saw the local politician leading the crowd. He saw some known faces in the sea of raging faces. Each one of them looked the same. Once again Abbu heard his name being called, 

*‚ÄoeIqbal Sahab, no need to worry. We are only here to talk and discuss. No body will be hurt.‚Äù * 

Abbu nodded and walked with Arif towards the main gate. The moment he saw the crowd in its full glory, his hands automatically folded and he begged for mercy. The politician opened the gate to let him on the street. Abbu looked around and spoke first - 

*‚ÄoeWe are terribly sad about the event that has happened. You have no idea how sad we are. The whole night we could not sleep. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s such a dreadful act and we are ashamed and whole-heartedly sorry. We have been living here since‚Ä¶‚Äù* 

*‚ÄoeIf you are so sad then why did you allow it to happen‚Äù,* someone yelled from the crowd. 

Abbu continued, *‚ÄoeSon how would we know anything about it. We live here. It happened thousands of kilometers away. We don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know anything about it.‚Äù* 

Hearing this, the politician again interrupted him and said, 

*‚ÄoeIqbal Sahab, what the youngster is asking is why do you allow such people to thrive in your community. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s because people like you give donations, shelter and patronage to such fanatics, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how they get the courage to commit such grisly acts. You are equally to be blamed for such accidents.‚Äù* 

Another roar of anger erupted, *‚ÄoeYes he is right. You are also to be blamed.‚Äù* 

This time Arif jumped in and said, *‚ÄoeWhat nonsense are you talking.‚Äù* This was the opportunity the angry crowd was waiting for. Before he could finish his sentence someone from the crowd pulled him down and the crowd started pouncing on him. Abbu was too stunned to move. He tried hard to pull the crowd apart, but everyone wanted to land a punch or a kick. Finally, he looked at the politician and begged him to intervene. The politician took some time and then leisurely asked the angry crowd to stop. The crowd reluctantly moved away and then he picked up Arif from the ground and whispered in his ears, 

*‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why when elders are talking, children should keep their mouth shut.‚Äù * 

Arif silently nodded and stood next to Abbu. The sudden bashing did cool down the crowd a bit. It also mildly satiated their appetite for symbolic revenge. Sensing that the crowd has started losing interest and the Sun was getting a bit too harsh. The politician decided that it was time for the final act. So he and some elders from the crowd came to Abbu and said, 

*‚ÄoeListen Iqbal Sahab, we are only following orders. You have lived here for twenty-five years and all and that is fine. But these are difficult times. We have been given a free hand for twelve hours. I am answerable to higher authorities. Tomorrow if they ask me how many have I killed, what will I say?‚Äù* 

Abbu just nodded. 

*‚ÄoeNow I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to kill and all. Not that I am scared. Honestly, at my one signal these guys will cut you and your family into pieces. And the police won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do anything. You know how it is. But this is a good locality. But you know how things can go out of control. I know you also have a young daughter and wife.‚Äù* 

The Sun was pissing hot magma on the heads of everyone standing infront of Iqbal mansion. Water vapor evaporated through the tarmac and Abbu stared hard at the road. His ears doubled up as eyes. His ears gave him the picture of what was coming, while his eyes were busy being hypnotized by the black tarmac. 

*‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to dirty my hands. But I have orders to follow. And youngsters today all the time want action. You know what I mean. But don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. I am here. But we have been strictly told to teach you guys a lesson. So as I said there has to be some punishment. Some kind of proof‚Ä¶you know what I mean‚Äù * 

Abbu again nodded. Probably he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even hear what the politician said. Arif waited for Abbu to speak. 

*‚ÄoeIqbal Sahab‚Ä¶‚Äù *Abbu again heard his name being called. But this time the tone was different. There was hint of history, concern and helplessness in it. It sounded more like a desperate wake up call. Abbu looked up and saw Mr.Kohli standing next to him. Tears and sweat were rolling down his wrinkled face. He once again said, 

*‚ÄoePlease agree to what he wants. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s prudent, please, atleast you will live.‚Äù * 

Abbu again nodded. Kohli pressed his shoulder and Abbu slowly sat down on the road. The politician gestured towards four of his guys who went inside Iqbal Mansion. Arif followed then from behind. The moment the guys entered the house a loud shrill escaped the windows. It must have been Shagufta. Arif calmed her down and asked Ammi to lock her in the bedroom. Musheer came running out calling for Abbu and saw him sitting on the road. He sat next to him. A few long minutes passed and then the crowd saw the four guys coming out of the house carrying the sofa on their shoulders. It looked like a short funeral procession with Ammi quietly sobbing in the background. The crowd made some space for the Sofa. Someone from the crowd poured petrol on it and the next moment it turned into a pyre. Smoke and flames engulfed it. 30-year old Sofa, made with finest quality Burma teak was slowly turning into ash. 

Someone overheard someone murmuring in the crowd, ‚ÄoeWhat a waste. It was such a nice Sofa.‚Äù
