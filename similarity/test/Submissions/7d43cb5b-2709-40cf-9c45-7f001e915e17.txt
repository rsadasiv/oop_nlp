‚ÄoeWomen‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breasts are very, very powerful.‚Äù

The article referred to a topless march in summer. It was freezing outside and Niki couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t imagine going anywhere without ten layers of clothing but she read on. A few dozen women decided to illustrate an existing New York State Law: the right of all women to go bare-chested if they so chose. Apparently, it drew leering loafers with cameras who filmed frantically as the few topless women marched for their right to the same, a privilege men took casually.

Niki looked up from her MacBook.

In India, it was not uncommon for men to go bare-chested and bare-legged, muslin loincloth folded upwards from the knee and tucked into the waist. After marriage, she visited a South Indian temple and was shocked at the level of male nudity on display. Something to do with purity rituals and humidity levels. Still. And women didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a choice in the matter. First world, third world, women had to put up with shit everywhere.

A memory surged within Niki. She was back in her hometown of Chandigarh, an eleven-year-old in the winter of 1985.



"Tell me, Biji, why does a woman need god?"

Nooran sat cross-legged on the floor on a mat, shelling peas. Niki sat across from her atop an old newspaper polishing her school shoes. Slathering the Kiwi black polish on the scuffed toe of her shoe, Niki paused to watch. Dadima and Nooran were vastly different from other women she encountered: school teachers, mothers of friends, women on TV and in the movies. Their conversations made Niki feel like she was being let into a secret sorority of dangerous ideas - with a ringside view, she came away mostly enlightened, if occasionally mystified.

Dadima sat curled up in her favorite armchair, reading, the light from the floor lamp lighting her up in a halo. She looked up from her book and, from behind her reading glasses, studied the two squatters at her feet.

Now that she had her attention, Nooran did not wait for an answer but ventured one of her own. "What is it that god does exactly? Why is it that people worship him in so many different ways? Wearing out their slippers with daily treks to temples and mosques, fasting some days and feasting on others, flogging themselves in remembrance and flogging others in riots, blaring prayers over loudspeakers and blowing conch shells ‚Ä¶ Why? And whether they eat pig or cow or grass, all of them agree on one thing, that he created this world. But then, how is he different from a woman who has the power of creation right here." A pod in Nooran‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s right hand was pointed at her abdomen in a fine illustration of her point.

"A woman has a womb. And she creates a baby. So we have proof. Where is proof of this god anyway?"

"Like Brahma, the creator in the Hindu trinity" Niki added knowledgeably. "But he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a womb, I think."

Nooran nodded. "Men were plain jealous. Which is why they felt the need to create this fantastic creature," her hands created a canopy in the air, "god. Then another man said, why, I fancy my own god. And because he wanted to be different, he gave his god wings, or blue colour, or a crown of thorns. And it spread like disease, squabbling men building personal gods. Next, like a king needs a kingdom, each god needed an army of followers. So, religion."

Dadima folded the daily and took off her glasses. "Women certainly don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need religion."

"Why Dadima?"

"Look at this article." She indicated the newspaper with a disdainful hand. "It says that in Khalistan, the proposed pure state of Sikhs, women will be required to keep their hair long, their heads covered, wear salwar kameez only ‚Ä¶ In effect, another version of Pakistan, the original land of the pure!" She snorted.

Seeing the puzzlement on Niki‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face, she elucidated. "Who is issuing these diktats? Men. Whom are they issuing them for? Women? Why, I ask? If you are so interested in rehat-maryada, cultural traditions, observe them yourself. Why does religion always boil down to a rule book on how to control women?" She paused and looked at her granddaughter pointedly.

"Because men are scared of women?"

"And why are they sacred of women?" Dadima prompted.

"Because women can do one thing men can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t?"

"Bingo! A woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s religion is motherhood. Which is why men are forever trying to dictate to them which ‚Äoereligion‚Äù," Dadima made quote marks in the air with her fingers, "they belong to. When they stamp a woman - Hindu, Muslim, Sikh - they automatically stamp their children as well. And always, they assume the command and control of the tribe. When, in reality, as Nooran said, the command should lie, if at all, with the original creator."

Nooran clucked in agreement. "Women create babies, men create god. So they can kill in his name. Then wash their sins in a temple or mosque. But going to Mecca solves nothing, no?"

"I tell you what," Nooran said, "put one condition to men, just one condition, then watch them straighten up like bamboo."

"What condition?" Niki asked.

"A man has to give birth, physical birth like a woman does. After which, he can go kill one person. Five children - here, take five licenses to kill. See how quickly all killing stops. Remember that story from the Mahabharata, the birth of the Kauravas?"

Nooran pronounced Mahabharata such that it sounded like Ma-Bharat, Mother India. Was it her accent or a deliberate attempt?

"Gandhari was given a boon by Vyasa and she asked for 100 sons. Though why any woman would need so many babies beats me," Nooran shook her head as she ran her fingers through the mound of peas looking for bad ones. "She carried her pregnancy for two years. Now imagine if her husband, the King, had to have a mountain of a swollen belly for that time?"

"But Nooran," Niki protested, "a man doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the organs to give birth!"

"Precisely. The apparatus required for birth is not just a womb. You think a man has the fortitude to carry a baby in his body for nine months? Then nurse it for years? Mahabharata tells us that Gandhari birthed 100 Kaurava sons. No mention of how she raised 100 mewling babies. Fed them, bathed them, loved them, taught them?"

"She was a queen, she had help!"

"Sure, but a mother has to break up squabbles, sing lullabies at bed time, cook 100 different favorite meals ‚Ä¶ Now imagine the King caring for his 100 sons while his wife lolled about issuing orders."

Niki saw a bejeweled King holding an infant in his arms, watching with horror as piss trickled over his silk garments, 99 other babies besieging him.

"Instead, the blind King was keenest on the battle," Dadima waded in. "Which makes you wonder what he was thinking? That with a hundred, he had sons to spare?"

"There is more than one way to be blind, Biji."

Outside, dusk was turning to dark quickly in the manner of winter and the room had acquired a hushed glow. The women sat in a circle in the living room, the lit lamp like a fire around which they were gathered, absorbed in their individual tasks, shelling peas, polishing shoes, reading paper, conversing, occasionally illustrating for the benefit of the child in their midst, shared stories binding them together.

"Men," Nooran offered, "you place an infant in their arms, and they start to play passing the parcel!" She burst into laughter, her belly jiggling beneath the shiny floral kameez she wore.

Niki paused in her polishing as a thought struck her. "But Nooran, what about a woman who doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have children?"

"Someone like me, you mean? Why, she is a god still, make her another avatar if you like. These male gods have multiple avatars, no? Any way," Nooran plucked the bad peas, "why do I need a certificate from anybody? I am my own certificate."

"But what Nooran said is so true," Dadima resumed the earlier thread. "If a man could give birth, he would find it problematic to kill."

"I wonder what Papa would say to that?"

Dadima uncrossed her legs and stood up. She traversed the room and switched on the ceiling light. ‚ÄoeHe'd agree."

Light shone off her polished shoe, she had done a good job of buffing it. She could do Papa‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s black leather shoes next. He was travelling to Punjab on field work, which meant he would return with sneakers that Nooran would soak in a plastic tub for a full day to loosen the dirt. Lately, she had done it often. Police in Punjab had a new weapon: Tada. The image it conjured was of a giant policeman who squashed detainees under his ample ass. However, it was a special Act of Law that allowed people to be detained without being produced before a magistrate. Which was where Papa came in. The frantic parents hoped to use his skills and connections to get through to their sons. Papa would return after a couple of days, bearing soil and sun and stories. Such as the mother who cooked rotis for her son daily. Even after his body was located and the corpse cremated.

 Dadima‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice brought Niki back. "You know, when I told him the story of Ameena‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mum - how she taught me the kalma to recite on the way to their home, so I could become a temporary Muslim and eat nihari without guilt? He said that if Ameena‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mum, an illiterate woman, could solve the conundrum of religion with such ease, would the violence of Partition have occurred if the leaders were mothers?"

"Like Nooran said, if the King had given birth to 100 sons! But" Niki frowned, "the Mahabharata was fought over a kingdom."

"Religion and real estate go together. Like pus and boil," Nooran quipped.

"What is religion but the kingdom of god. And every kingdom needs?"

To Dadima‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s questioning gaze, Niki replied, "Land and people?"

"And sacrifice. The Mahabharata gave this land its name, which is important to remember, for that was what the story was about."

"Not dharma?"

"That too, but its heart is about land, its hold on men, and what men will do for it. Real estate, really."

Dadima would know. She had lost her husband (Indo-Pak war, ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>71) and her home (Lahore, ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>47) to that story.

"Maybe, women, like god, have no country, and the whole world is theirs, as Nooran said. Or none." Dadima sighed, "And they have to reconcile to being shunted as borders are switched, old ones erased, new ones built up. Women like train bogeys, shunted here, shunted there."

Nooran gathered the steel plate piled high with green peas and arose. "Biji, they can be Heer."

Heer again. It was a popular poem. About the heroine of the Heer-Ranjha couple, the Indian Juliet who fell in love with a man from the opposite camp. Heer that was popularly sung was a composition by Waris Shah, Dadima had informed her. Point though was that Heer was ubiquitous‚Ä"

"And get poisoned by their own family?" Dadima asked.

‚Ä" and unfortunate, Niki completed the thought.

"How is that fate any different?" Dadima continued.

"She left her name on every Punjabi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lips," Nooran swept out of the room, long braid sliding from her shoulder to her ample hips, the tasseled bells tinkling as she walked.



A ping from her MacBook brought Niki back to the present. Now that she was older, Niki knew better. Heer was no Indian Juliet. A beautiful, wealthy high-class woman who railed against family, society and clergy, and ultimately sacrificed her life for love, Heer was a rebel and a martyr.

If Heer was alive in Manhattan, she would be one of the topless women.
