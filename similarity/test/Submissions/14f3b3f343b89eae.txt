*Jakkamma* 

Kuruvumma woke up with the broadest of smiles this morning. If you know Kuruvumma, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll also know why Muni was suspicious of this smile. 

Kuruvumma was the kind of woman that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d spent all of her childhood dreaming of getting the hell out of Kalkulam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fishing hamlet, Puthur. She wanted to live as far away from the ocean as possible. Wanted to wash that smell of drying fish off of her skin, her hair‚Ä¶ Her mind. And no matter what else happened or did not, she was sure of one thing. She was not going to sell fish. Not while her husband lay drinking on the sands. She would marry a man with a job. Any job that did not involve waking up before the sun and heading into the threatening waters, crashing against its waves. That did not involve some day, never returning from the ocean, wolfed down by that gluttonous water goddess or shot dead in the middle of the sea. That did not involve living with a man whose very skin was turning into a salt sack. 

Muni was the sort of man that wanted to be buried at sea. Those cerulean waters were his true calling. The ocean was the only goddess he bowed to. And she was his first love. He would say to his friends, ‚ÄoeWhen I die, I want to be burnt up, not buried. I will pay for my own urn. I shall save for it every day. It will be ceramic and I will have it painted, I will. I want my ashes thrown into the sea. So I can become one with the ocean. So I can become the ocean!‚Äù His day began not when he opened his eyes in the morning, but when he pushed his catamaran into the sea, gently whistling, feeling the wind against his soft, curly hair. When he spotted, a little inside the sea, the karuvandu birds, which almost always circled the waters beneath which a big catch of fish lay. And his day ended with a meal made from the fresh catch. It didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter what he caught, but the idea that he had caught what he ate made him feel alive. Made his mother call him her hero. 

Theirs was a match made in the wrong sort of heavens. When his mother came to her house to ask for Kuruvamma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d promised that her son would give up fishing. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d also said that he had a big job offer from the Electricity Board. As a line man. She promised to leave all of her pigs, hens and even her new puppy to the care of Kuruvamma. 

‚ÄoeYou can even move out of the hamlet, if you want. My brother-in-law has a house in Chellanthurithy. Muni may be out on some nights for work because of the shift system, but when it is a government job, who can say no?‚Äù Valliamma had said. 

‚ÄoeYou lied to me Valliamma.  You bull-headed old thing. And now I am stuck with this monster who would choose the sea over his wife. Just like my father,‚Äù Kuruvamma would say looking north, every morning just as she opened her eyes, clicking her tongue and biting her teeth in contempt. Poor Valliamma had felt compelled to lie for her son. 

‚ÄoeThey say you can tell a thousand lies to complete a wedding. And for my son I shall lie till the day I die,‚Äù she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d said.

Muni had come home one night having spotted this angel of a girl, with a white stone nose pin, on the shore. She was wearing a yellow half saree, and her skirt was tucked in near her waist, so that the waves did not lick her clothes, they stopped at her knees, as Muni watched them with intense jealousy. She wore a single, long plait as a few stray strands of hair caressed her face, pirouetting against the breeze. From a distance, standing on his boat, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d seen her. Like that goddess Kanyakumari whose nose pin guided the lost to the shore, Kuruvamma had brought Muni home. He told his mother he would marry no one else. And after arranging the marriage, Valliamma had passed on, to join her husband and according to Kuruvamma watch the fun from a distance as the fireworks went on in that little hut. 

Muni bore the brunt of Kuruvamma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disappointment the very morning that followed his wedding. As she ran out to the far end of the sea, followed by a teasing neighbourhood girl brigade, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d stayed up all night listening to the strange sounds of their conjugal bliss, washing her feet in the frothy sea, whipping out her hair into a free mess, he came out behind her, smoking a beedi, looking dapper in his lungi and vest. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d assumed her new husband had come to see her. She got up and walked towards him only to stop midway as he lunged forward into the sea, pushing his catamaran. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when she noticed the other men with Muni. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d all filed out together. 

Singing his blues, talking to the ocean, as if she were the mistress whose arms he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait to run into, her new husband, unaware of his mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s many stories, went in to work that day, waving to her, and sending her a kiss that was lost in the wind. When he returned with his catch Kuruvamma refused to go out and sell with the other wives. 

‚ÄoeYou liar! Valliamma! I shall have my revenge when I die. You wait and see,‚Äù she said looking north, clicking her tongue. She did not direct any of her anger his way. She was worried that he may hit her, though Valliamma had said to her that he was as soft as the pillow she laid her head on. That he would never hit her, but who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to know? Perhaps that was a lie too, Kuruvamma feared. And so she sought refuge in this imaginary scolding. Poor Valliamma, was not going to come back from the grave to defend herself anyway. And Muni did not come to his mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rescue. He was happy in a way that it had all worked out without any interference from him. His wife had found her own ways to cope. 

So you know now, why Muni was suspicious of his wife‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smile early this morning. He didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go in to the sea all day. He just sat in his sister‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stall, smoking packets of beedi, drinking sweet toddy all day long. 

‚ÄoeCould she?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWould she?‚Äù 

He wondered. 

‚ÄoeThat damn kurikaari!‚Äù he said, kicking the sand, chugging his drink in. 

*** 

He was alone by the shore one day that week, waiting for his friends to join him on the day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voyage. And she had come out of nowhere, that woman with a wand in hand, her hair held in a bun, a giant red bindi on her forehead, her face glowing a golden yellow, as if she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d bathed in turmeric, draped in a deep red saree. To predict his future. 

‚ÄoeYou will be fine. You will be... Jakkamma tells me you will be a great husband. A faithful man, indeed. But Jakkamma also predicts that someone who hates you all day and all night long lives close by. Very closeby indeed. Be careful... Do not believe them. Jakkamma tells me it is a woman you love. Do not trust your life with this woman.‚Äù With that and two mackerels for payment, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d walked away.
