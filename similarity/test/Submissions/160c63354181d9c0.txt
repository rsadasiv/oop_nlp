This is a fable-like tribute to the persisting myths of Newari people of Kathmandu, who are fast losing many of their cultural heritages due to the brutal forces of man and nature.

*The Legend of Gwara and Shakya* Salik Shah 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to live here anymore,‚Äù the little boy said. ‚ÄoeThis house stinks and shakes and rattles like the butcher‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s truck.‚Äù 

His father remained silent. He had filled his lungs with the fresh air of the valley without worrying about falling sick not so long ago. Kathmandu was a different place then: relaxed, happy and quiet. Life in the valley was now hectic and noisy. A house near the river was considered to be a sign of fortune back then. Rice and fish was often on the menu. The river was a healer and a friend. The Shakyas sat at the bank washing off their sweat, dirt and exhaustion from tending their vegetable field on its bank. 

Nobody wanted to live next to the stinking river these days if they could afford it. It was the source of grief and bitterness. The river made lives miserable for people living nearby. No one was interested in buying the Shakya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s real estate. Not even the butcher next door. 

‚ÄoeThe property is good,‚Äù the butcher said. ‚ÄoeWhat about the ghosts?‚Äù ‚ÄoeWhat ghosts?‚Äù Rakesh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father replied. ‚ÄoeOh, you think I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄoeEveryone knows that house is *possessed* by the dead priest and his tantric beast.‚Äù ‚ÄoeNonsense,‚Äù Rakesh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father said. ‚ÄoeI acquired my property for a dirt cheap price,‚Äù the butcher said. ‚ÄoeThanks to *them*!‚Äù 

The attitude of the people reaffirmed the Shaya family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision to move out. They couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sell the house, but they moved out eventually to a rented apartment near Chhauni. 

The Shakya family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s departure came as a great relief to Gwara. She was aware of their changing attitude towards her. In the old days, the Shakya family put aside a small portion of food customarily for the elusive caretaker in the kitchen. It was a ridiculous custom, now they thought. There was no place for religion and myth in their urban lives. 

Gwara knew the world was changing around her, and the time of magic was coming to an end. Yet she was bound by her contract with the Great Shakya to guard the house against intruders and evil spirits ‚Ä"a chore she had found easy to carry out now that she was on her own. The birds and animals knew the house was taken. They left her alone. The adolescent boys were nuisance though. She had to scare and put some sense in those urchins‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> heads, who came to the house in the cover of night to prove that tantric creatures and ghosts were a complete nonsense. 

The sacred contract had required Gwara to stay out of the human sight. Now she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to make the effort to hide or be quiet. 

Gwara was happy, perhaps a little noisy too. After wandering up and down the house all night‚Ä"barring the worship room on the ground floor with a statue of the Great Shakya‚Ä"she would find herself mounting the attic for a good day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sleep. 

All was fine and good until the quake monsters returned from the distant mountains to sack the valley in the summer. The house shook off the mud-clamped slabs of the attic and gave way to the open sky, crisp moonlight. Gwara rolled her body over the rubble of terracotta slabs, vermillion, dust. She skidded through the content of a cardboard box, which lay scattered: abir of different shades‚Ä"red, yellow, orange and green‚Ä", a rusty handle of a black-hooded bumbershoot, a pair of old khadau with a missing toe cliff, and faded scrolls with mandalas and chants. 

Gwara made her body as hard as the rock beneath her golden-brown fur as she moved. The quake of Bikram Sambat 2027 had exposed over a hundred-year-old bricks used in its construction by the great Shakya. After creating her out of rock, thread and vermillion, the Shakya had bound her with a customary incantation to protect the house of the clan, his guthi, and its human inhabitants from wandering ills and predatory Khyahs. 

As Gwara lifted her round, wooly body towards the safe ground from the slight corner of the roof, which barely remained, her throat gasped for clean, scrubbed air. A frail, furry croak escaped her throat hidden inside the wool as she shook off the dirt that clung to her body. 

Gwara was now ready. She started to spin around the rubble of the house, slowly, and then gaining speed furiously. As she rolled into a ball of flames, inching closer and closer towards the worship room, the dull idol of the great Shakya started to crackle. As she closed the worship room inside a wall of flames, the statue grew bigger and brighter at the center of her incandescent dance. 

When Gwara finally stopped, there stood a young, well-built man with a mysterious smile and beautiful face, light-brown skin, and long, dark curly hair. And the sacred fire had also turned Gwara into a beautiful woman. The young couple didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exchange a word. Silently, they headed north towards the holy peak of Mount Kailasha, gleaming beneath a thousand stars. 

Upon reaching the great lake under Mount Kailasha, according to the urban legend, the great Shakya cut a ridge near dawn and drained its water. He then captured its many gem-scaled fishes and nectar-filled snakes, and together with Gwara, settled down by dusk to the task of building a new house under the shade of a giant lotus upon the fertile ground of Samsara.
