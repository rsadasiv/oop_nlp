My friend, who grew up with me here is in Mumbai now. We just shared a laugh on Whatsapp, a real laugh.The new bigger emojis make every expression seem realer than its predecessors.  She was telling me how ridiculous she finds the girls in local trains who read *50 shades of grey* with the book covers draped in brown paper. I laughed along. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want her to know Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not courageous. Reading in public is courageous.

Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m reading Taslima Nasrin. No brown paper to my rescue. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m self conscious as if Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m wearing a dress for the sake of fashion and not comfort. But Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not reading this book in public to attract attention, no. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m just reading it. It couldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been any book, I like reading outdoors. I remember reading *Reading Lolita in Tehran* in college, in Bangalore. This depresses me because I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t read *Lolita* yet. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve avoided it to avoid the *Anxiety of Influence *because Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve 25 years worth anxiety already. Google tells me I have quarter-life crisis. When you have Google, youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re self-sufficient. This will pass. It should pass. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re a crisis. A crisis that cannot be mitigated. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re a planned failure who shouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been aborted.

Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m currently planning a masterpiece on censorship, the art of storytelling and more. A novel cannot be about just one thing, Adichieâ€<sup>TM</sup>s protagonist from *Americanah *had said. My book is still in its planning stage. Whoaâ€¦ *my* book..feels surreal. Am I being overambitious? Nothing conceived yet. I think of how easy it is to abort it after conception. But without conception there is nothing. I look to my left and right, joggers pass by me. No one is noticing me or what Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m reading, yet Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m scared. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re doing nothing martyr like. No one reads in this place. Even if you read Rushdie no one would care. No one cares as long as you donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t announce it blatantly. Then too they might dismiss you saying â€<sup>~</sup>Kalli-Walliâ€<sup>TM</sup>. You donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t exist for them. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re just another expat. Donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t pretend youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re something greater than you are. Illegal Bangalis are courageous. Not you. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re not even like the roaches at home. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve survived generations. You will cease to exist.

I think of writing a story titled â€<sup>~</sup>Reading Nasrin in â€¦.â€<sup>TM</sup>. I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even think of it, how will I write it. Thoughts and actions. Both matter. *I confess to Almighty God, and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have sinned through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my wordsâ€¦* Writing with the intent of being published is courageous. I think of *Dora: The Headcase*, the book I finished recently and* Intertextuality*, the concept it led me to. Just because you know appellations like *Anxiety of Influence* and *Intertextuality *does not guarantee your success as a writer. Application of theory is what matters, isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t that what you learnt in MBA? Writing should not even be on your mind right now. You need to look for a job that will justify your doing MBA. You need to agree to see guys soon. And all you think of isâ€¦

No conception, no abortion. No classics, no contemporaries. Would youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve existed had your sibling not been aborted? You recently learnt that your elder sibling had been aborted. You must do something with your life. You owe it to the foetus. If you make no meaning of your existence, why are you living? All your stories are like abnormal babies, disfigured, almost begging to be aborted. Theyâ€<sup>TM</sup>re contrived. A story which might seem confessional to the reader, which has the chance of being your best piece ever lingers in your head...

You will cease to exist, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s what you want. You feel like watching *The Machinist* again. He had hit-and-run guilt, you have survivorâ€<sup>TM</sup>s guilt. Writing should help. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve diagnosed yourself. For the accurate diagnosis you want to see a counselor but youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve heard that a counselor never directly provides a solution, youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve to look for it in the end, just like in MBA- no spoon feeding.

I begin to write about my reading of Nasrin in public. It is going well. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve managed to fictionalise the experience yet Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m scared. This is not the time someone should be scared, no. It's 2016 dammit! Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s almost every day that you see the youth championing social media campaigns. Free. The world is free. Yes, you can get arrested. Worst case scenario? You will be deported. What else? Be a disappointment to your parents. That you already are. Maybe you shouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been aborted instead of the foetus.

No, the worst case scenario would be: you will not be read at all. Wait or is that the best case scenario? If youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re read and banned, it will create more readership, reverse psychology works on you too. But no, you will not be banned. You will not be read for the simple fact: Your stories have always been contrived. How will it be any different now?

 You were conceived and given birth to. Now what? What to make of this existence? This miserable existence which derives its understanding of life from books and films. This frame of reference that seeps into prose and makes you sound pretentious. What is the use of such an existence where youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re afraid of prosecution for being confessional? Afraid of whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s next? Afraid of yourself?

You owe this place. It gave you your identity. Traitor. You get to wear what you want... You get to readâ€¦Nasrin is not afraid. Yuknavitch is not. Not you, not you. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re destined to write contrived stories which will disappear into the abyss of the internet. Your work will cease to exist even before you do. You should watch the movie again. One more time wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hurt. No! You should write. Do something with your life. Write something worth reading, maybe it is time you stop admiring others and do something worth being admired. Bale method acted for the movie. You read that he had crossed the weight loss barrier set by the doctors. Take the leap. Maybe this leap in writing will help you take the bigger leap, the most important leap. Marriage. Do it. Do it. This urge to do something else other than write is Satan. He doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want you to prosper or is he just realistic? Write. Write. Jesus has gifted you with a talent. You let it go, it will be an insult to him. To the foetus. Write. Write.

I stare at the blank page. Silence. Is provocation. Only when something is expected of you. No one is expecting anything of you. It just means cowardice, means you donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have what it takes to be a writer. To not want to write is also courageous. To be okay with mediocrity and the fact that you donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t mind not being remembered, the fact that youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve done nothing to be rememberedâ€¦Shut the fuck up! Just Write!       Over a thousand words now, it is in third person. First and second person narratives run the risk of sounding confessional. You should be fine. Maybe with this piece, your writing has a chance of redemption, of making you shine. Each word on the page stands out accusing you of being a coward because youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve slightly fabricated reality and you will be calling it fiction. Only the bravest people donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t mind being seen as cowards, who said that? Yes. The God of fantasy literature. Writing something confessional and labeling it as fiction is cowardice or bravery?

Maybe the foetus wouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been a brave soul. A martyr. Had the foetus been granted life, how would youâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve viewed yourself? It is not about you. It is not about you all the time. The foetus couldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been ordinary or extraordinary. Maybe, it wouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve had no anxiety disorder, no quarter life crisis. And seeing that, you wouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been saved too. A predecessor is a savior to a successor. Classics make contemporary possible. Devoid of classics, would there be a contemporary? Without the foetus, can you exist, should you exist? Jesus died on the cross to save you from sin. Taking your life is sin. Abortion is sin.

The third person is going fine. But there are no characters in the story except yourself. Readers donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t digest solipsism easily. Noise is good. Characters making noise is good. Not in oneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s own head. There are the joggers and your friend in the story too but they are ghosts. They cease to exist once your voice takes over. Can you add the foetus? At least grant it life in a story, make it breathe through your words?

Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s okay. Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s what writers do. Make fiction seem real. Make the real seem fictional. You canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t use the excuse anymore that you havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t studied literature. Not since Google. You canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t use the excuse no, but, the anxiety is there because you self-teach, self-analyse, self-diagnose. You donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even have confidence in the self then why do you listen to it?

Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re a poor listener. To others. Your Facebook feed, the cacophony of voices makes you want to shrink like the foetus and cease to exist. Amidst all that noise, your voice will either disappear or add to the cacophony. Among the contemporary stories from young Indians in great Indian literary journals, yours willâ€¦? Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re not young anymore. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re 25.

The foetus has a unique voice, demanding a different story. Metafiction . *It will be *a story within a story within a story. Layers. Evasion. Evasion is smart, Arabs think so, said Anais Nin. Fiction is evasion of reality or the closest one could get to reality? The foetus is speaking to the mother, the opposite of what Barua does in *Rebirth.* Pretentious. Literary and cinematic references or allusions in a story is pretentious.

Maybe your story will make a difference. It will empower a writer to write about something difficult and true? It will move someone who has lost a sibling or a child? No. You will be seen as confessionalâ€¦ Why confess in prose? Why not to the priest at church? Prose is safer or is it? Pretentiousâ€¦ But Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the only way you can understand your existence, through literature and cinema-storytelling. Plagiaristâ€¦You will be sued for using othersâ€<sup>TM</sup> wordsâ€¦ Solipsisticâ€¦Do you really want the foetus to have a voice? Its voice will overpower yours in the narrative. Avoid the foetus, the way you avoid classics, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the only way you will exist. But you want to cease to exist, no?

This indecision is a symptom of quarter life crisis. Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re neither a hero nor a villain. Readers donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t like this hovering. Indecision is not appreciated, neither in fiction, nor in reality. Attributing this indecisive nature of yours to a disorder will sound like every other plotless film or book which attributes all the unfavourable actions and thoughts of the protagonist to a disorder. People want closure, yes, but life does not always provide closure, *Catcher in the eye* didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have one. Keep it real.

I restrict the foetusâ€<sup>TM</sup> voice to just two lines. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s there and itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not there. Just like the time in the womb. Good. What next? The title of the story? If you want to stir up trouble, name the place blatantly. Or post something scandalous about it on social media like everyone else. But you donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to. Art. Aesthetics. Tweets are considered micro- fiction, literature! Shut up! Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re not going to take the easy way out! Concentrate. You just want to write something that can be remotely considered as literary and true. Maybe you can create a fictional place. Manu Bhattathiri created Karuthupuzha. Anees Salim created Mangobaag. So can you.

â€<sup>~</sup>Reading Nasrin inâ€¦â€<sup>TM</sup>.

Wait. But...the title succeeds the story. The naming of the foetus succeeds birth. DELETE.
