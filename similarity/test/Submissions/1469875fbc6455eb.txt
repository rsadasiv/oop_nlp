CROSSROADS 

Her twenty-year-old eyes dripped with rapid, moist tears. She wanted to run away. The brick-hut she lived in was home only to despair. All those things they said ‚Ä" she wanted to fling herself out of this edifice of cement and rock. She longed hard to see new things. Aminjikarai stuck to her like an immobile giant, growling with all its near-death mess. Worse, marriage raised its ominous head. To glue her together to the slums, till the curtains closed. The only choice was to stick back. No escape holes, no release, not even momentary bail. 

Her grandmother turned overnight into a demon. ‚ÄoeThis house is stuffed with books, what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the use? Throw them away; they won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help you conceive, will they? And these English newspapers you read, only worth wrapping bajjis,‚Äù she sneered while folding her beloved betel leaves. ‚ÄoeRam saar wants a daughter-in-law. For all he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s done to help this family, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s our time to repay, your time.‚Äù 

Kanti scorned the idea of marriage. The girls in her locality grew up on day-dreamy thoughts of marriage, she, on books and solid thoughts. An urgent need for change gnawed into her like tentacles into a weedy sea. She raised her sinking head from the wobbly table to face the bare ceiling as the options said hello ‚Ä" either walk carelessly into death, or run for life. 

In the heat of that scorching evening, she thought of Ravi ‚Ä" Ram‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only son, with utter frustration. ‚ÄoeRavi was the first boy to see you ‚Ä" naked and crying ‚Ä"  at the hospital. The entire Maariatha Street knows how much he loves you,‚Äù Maragatham kept repeating with grandmotherly pride. ‚ÄoeAh, how he smiles at you, like he owns you already.‚Äù 

She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind having been caught naked. After all, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d only been a wailing, undiscerning little infant. Her brain had just begun to gather sense. Where was the question of feeling conscious about being caught naked on a blanket? 

Ravi was the object of all her hate, thanks to her grandmother. Maragatham always asked him to look after Kanti when she went to work at his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s store. It was not the men outside home she was afraid of, but her own lunatic, alcoholic son, Somu.  He would beat up little Kanti like dirty clothes on a hard, dry rock when she refused to comply with his demands. 

‚ÄoeKanti, how are you? Paatti said you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re all alone. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m here. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll keep you safe,‚Äù Ravi had grinned at her doorstep the day after her seventh birthday. It was her first ever memory of the teetering, babbling idiot that he was. 

He began to hunt down ways to establish himself as a permanent presence in Kanti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life. He followed her everyday to the vegetable market, patiently waited outside her tuition centres. The minute she got on her third-hand bicycle and raced down the streets, he appeared. He begged for quick speeding rides around the temple to scare beggars away, kept telling everyone how much he loved her. 

Ram saar was Kanti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s uncle, her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s half-brother. Maragatham worked at his store day and night, and as payment, his son hovered over Kanti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life to take care of her. Ravi, unlike Kanti, loved every moment of it, he adored her. 

************* 

It was her seventh birthday. Kanti was dressed beautifully in a lacey yellow frock Maragatham had borrowed from Rathi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother. ‚ÄoeHer father begs for alcohol, and she, for my beautiful yellow dress. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll wash it myself with care next time so I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t fall sick with disease wearing it again. Wonder what she carries on her skin,‚Äù Rathi had smirked behind her back at school. Rathi was an idiot, always blabbering with the boys and making fun of Kanti behind her back, copying from her at school tests. But Maragatham had told her Somu had bought it from a big clothes shop at T Nagar. Hence, oblivious, she sat gleeful on the verandah, drawing horrible pictures of Rathi on her school rough note book. She ticked away in exasperation the big ants that kept rolling up her sleeve. 

It was seven ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>o‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> clock in the morning. Somu woke up with a hangover. He usually slept till noon on the verandah and walked straight to the whiskey store to get his fill. His mother cautiously locked the door from inside to keep him away except at meals. Today, he was terribly sick, desperate for a drink. 

He staggered upto Kanti with a baleful glare, looked her up and down, grunted sarcastically at her new dress.  ‚ÄoeWhere did that stupid woman steal this dress from? Or did she beg at the temple to pool in money? Answer me, girl,‚Äù he snarled. Kanti shivered a little, and quietly attempted to murmur an answer. She felt overpowered by his stare and the rancid stench of his whiskey-clad breath. She only blinked. 

‚ÄoeThrow your empty old book in the sink, run to the liquor shop and get me a bottle of whiskey,‚Äù he ordered. 

Maragatham had set off to the temple early that morning to shave her hair off for the Maariatha to bless her grand-daughter. ‚ÄoeThe day her mother died leaving her to me a premature little baby, people told me she wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t survive, looking at her bony, frail body and sunken eyes. But today she stands erect, seven years old. Still alive. Maariatha has blessed me,‚Äù she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d declared to her gossipy neighbours as she left the door ajar and rushed early so there wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be a crunch at the temple. 

************* 

‚ÄoeDo you have a beautiful mother, sweetheart?‚Äù the man at the counter teased. He laughed and tightened the plastic cap over the cracked bottle. Had Somu seen with his own eyes the leaking, fly-infested old bottle he would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve picked a brawl with the owner. Somu was the most unkempt man in the neighbourhood. Kanti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s enemies at school named her the ‚Äoebeggar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s daughter.‚Äù When it came to his drink though, her father was impeccable. It was the sole area of his life where he sought perfection. 

The man edged his face closer to Kanti, like one of those education inspectors at school. ‚Äoe50 rupees,‚Äù his assistant said grimly. 

Kanti stood shaking; there was no trace of comprehension on her face as she stared back in desperation at the owner. 

‚ÄoeAppa‚Ä¶.has the money, saar.‚Äù 

The man drew the bottle back on the counter, with a ridiculous peek at her dress once again. 

‚ÄoeNo money, no whiskey. Get out. ‚Äoe 

Insult. ‚ÄoeI need the whiskey right now. Give it to me.‚Äù She pulled the bottle out of his hand and fled. 

She bumped herself against the distorted gaps in-between the smelly tables. Lecherous men bit menacingly into their burnt chicken as they gulped down ravenous mouthful of beer and soda, giving her sideways looks. ‚ÄoeTell Somu to bring you with him everyday, looking pretty in that dress.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWe have to make her dance on the table, will talk to Somu about it.‚Äù Once out of the shop, she walked all the more consciously. A roar of syrupy laughter abounded the street and before she knew it, she was back home, offering Somu the whiskey. 

That night, Kanti lay on her grandmother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lap. She sobbed quietly. Tears soaked Maragatham‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s torn pallu. The woman was appalled. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d seen with her own eyes a sight she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d always dreaded. Little Kanti running barefoot from the alcohol shop, bottle in hand, liquid whiskey trickling down and leaving a trail all the way home. 

‚ÄoeIsn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that your granddaughter? You mentioned the offering at the temple, but this is surprising. What a birthday gift!‚Äù Kanaga from next-door teased. 

The lady dropped her prasadham. The vermillion she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d wanted to slather on Kanti‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s forehead as blessing scattered over the ground. It left a deep red scar on the brown earth. Her shaven head remained the only evidence of her temple visit. All through Somu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s teenage years, as his drinking habits worsened, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lain down in ditches, throwing up and yelling at passers-by. Everywhere she went, laughter followed. But today, shame hit the hardest. 

‚ÄoePaatti, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s run away from home. From appa. From the whiskey-shop owner. We owe them fifty rupees,‚Äù cried Kanti. 

************* 

Maragatham had struggled to make ends meet, to give her granddaughter an education. At twenty, Kanti had just finished twelfth class till she could no longer study as money had slipped out of their lives as love had. But she was the brightest girl in their community. She read widely. Her grandmother had put her into a convent. Let her speak good English, none of us in the family ever did, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d always thought. She begged for money from Ravi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father every single week, trying to meet the bills. But at the end of fourteen long school years, she was tired. Tired of hearing Kanti speak English to the rich boys she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d made friends with at school. Tired of her unruly, rebellious nature ‚Ä" always quoting from the books she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d read, acting smart. 

‚ÄoeYou should‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve put her in the local school like we did with Rathi. She failed thrice naturally in class five and never went back to school. Now she has two beautiful children. Your frivolous Kanti wants to go to college? Who will marry her how?‚Äù Kanaga chided the old woman at the supermarket. 

Somu was dying, the hospital bills mounted. Like an angel, Ravi offered to marry Kanti. The good news, he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want dowry. Maragatham‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s days were coming to an end. This was the time to hand-over Kanti to a reasonable boy. Her memory was dying out, so was she. 

************* 

That evening, Kanti walked out of her house in a half-saree, pondering a timely escape. She had with her the little money she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d stolen from Maragatham‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s purse that morning. She walked nearly three kilometres in the blazing, sultry May heat. Even the occasional neem tree offered scant respite to her anxieties. Maragatham‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words from the night before were strong in her mind ‚Ä"  ‚ÄoeYour mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blood runs in your veins ‚Ä" ungrateful half-orphan. You should‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve died with her.‚Äù 

The words stung her endlessly as she dragged her feet on in exhaustion. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d forced herself not to cry the entire week. People said crying was hard work. But trying not to was harder. Finally, the bus-stand arrived. Where was the wretched bus? 

‚ÄoeBoy, watch out. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let the peanut get into your nose,‚Äù a harsh voice sounded from behind. Turning, Kanti looked at a little boy holding his guardian‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, so gladly. The peanuts in his hand jumped from his ticking fingers into an eager mouth. His feet danced on the dirt-sloshed road like they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care. She stared at the happy child, envious. Here he was, in the most cluttered part of the world, and yet so free. 

The curious girl peered closely at the boy and wondered how long the fun would last. He would grow up in this wretched place. Poverty would strike like a thunderbolt upon the tree of happy, peaceful childhood he was so unsuspectingly sheltering under. This happy ambitious face that caught those elusive bouncing peanuts so effortlessly would never be familiar to the world. He might never go to school, never wear the clothes he coveted. But he would be a man. He could run away fearlessly if his father wanted to force him on a girl. Nobody would rape him near the rice mill. If he ever decided to come back, he wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be asked to go back, would only be greeted with more peanuts. What would they say if she returned? Maragatham would probably be dead by then. 

A new fear slithered into her mind. What if someone found her? Ram‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s men prowled all around the place. They were nasty, heinous creatures. She would be killed, or even worse. Her thoughts raced to wretched Ram. The monster had pounced on her grandfather‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wealth, leaving nothing for her mother. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d married her mother, his half-sister to a penniless, vile drunkard and murmured ‚Äoegood riddance.‚Äù 

The boy walked on. Kanti stared into the distance, where he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been. Two roads touched and crossed before her. One of them led to an unknown future, and the other, to home ‚Ä" familiar, yet lacking in comfort. She sat down on the dirty pavement, broken. The crossroads stretched through her mind like harsh, difficult thoughts.
