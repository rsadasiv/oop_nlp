My Name is Dr.R. Saravana Raja. i teach sociology at the Pondicherry University in Puducherry. i have been for some time interested in creative writing. i tried writing a short story which i would like to submit for publication in your magazine. 



*Election at David Hostel!* 

The room door remained a bit open. We were sitting inside and talking to each other after a heavy lunch that we had at the hostel mess. Bharathi had to attend an hour of laboratory class in the afternoon, Simon did not have a class, I had to go for an hour of Hindi class near the chapel away from my department. 

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been only two months since we are here in this college at Madurai pursuing our Under-Graduate courses. Though I had studied at a residential school all through in a district head quarter i hail from a village in the western part of Tamil Nadu. Bharathi comes from a village from a district down south of Madurai, and Simon comes from a place very near to Madurai. We have been allotted Room number 25 at the David hostel. This particular room is situated at the corner of the ground floor in that rectangle shaped three storied building.  The rooms in the ground floor have always been allotted to the first year students, the first floor for the second year students, and the second floor for the final year students. With every year passing by one is expected to raise one floor above. With raising each floor you would also escape the intensity of the scrutiny of the warden. 

The door went wide open and we stood up in panic seeing more than 10 seniors entering our room. One among them named Senthil called us for attention in his loud authoritative voice ‚ÄoeListen here, brothers‚Äù. Senthil is a second year botany major student. He is tall and has also grown well horizontally. There were other seniors who had accompanied him, some of them were peeping into the room from outside the door. All I could see was countless heads blocking the main entrance of the door and some in the windows too. 

‚ÄoeDo you know who he is?‚Äù asked Senthil, pointing to that tall, dark and well built man. 

We nodded the affirmative. 

‚ÄoeWhat is his name?‚Äù he asked. 

‚ÄoePrabhu Anna‚Äù we said in a chorus. 

‚ÄoeYes, very good! You know, he is contesting for the Hostel General Secretary post‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou all should elect him as the Secretary of this hostel‚Äù 

Prabhu is in his final year of his economics course. I have seen him in these two months. He generally appears very calm but I knew him as an astute man. He is always surrounded by at least five to six people; all are from different department but may be from his home town and also his caste. He looks attractive with his tall, dark and well built features which are compounded by his calm personality. 

Senthil went further to introduce others who were contesting for other posts along with Prabhu from the same group. 

He said, ‚ÄoeThis is Ravi Kumar from the Commerce department and he is contesting for Joint secretary‚Äù. 

Ravi gestured a nod, we responded with a smile. I was thinking, how I would not remember him. He was the one who ragged me on the third day of my arrival on the campus. He had asked me to perform a snake dance on the corridor of the hostel. 

Senthil also introduced others who were contesting for Mess Secretary and Cultural Secretary. 

After introducing them he said, ‚ÄoeThe mess is at the moment providing bad food, if you elect Velu as mess secretary he will make sure we get good food‚Äù. He further said, ‚ÄoeWe know that the warden has been harassing freshers with his authority. We can put an end to that if you elect Prabhu Anna. If he becomes the General Secretary I promise he will kick the warden‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ass‚Äù 

I had no doubt about the capabilities of these people. Prabhu, though a calm personality, with an imposing figure has always looked capable of breaking loose into fights if situation demands. He also looked very determined to win this election. 

They all left the room making all kinds of promise, some of which we even never were aware of.  They also invited us for a tea and snacks party the next day evening, after the night study hour.  They had asked us to assemble at the Geetha tea stall outside the college around 10 o clock in the night. 

We sat back on our bed with a sense of relief after they left. Simon got up from his chair and walked slowly like a cat bending forward towards the door. He peeped outside, closed the door and said, ‚Äoe I hate that  Ravi fucker, he made me do pull-ups in the mess hall last month in front of hundreds of people, I felt humiliated‚Äù 

While I joined Simon to complain about them, Bharathi was quiet but listening to us carefully with his usual smile that peeps out from his lips with so much hesitation. He has been like that since I have seen him from the day one on this campus. I find him to be thinking something all the time. But I have also seen him read a lot of things beyond his science subjects.  Bharathi, in his husky voice, told us about the different groups in the hostel. He said, ‚ÄoePrabhu and co are a group that comes from certain place and with certain caste background. There is another group with certain caste background that considers itself opposed to Prabhu and his group.  And there are also students in this hostel who do not fall into either of these groups, they belong to variety of castes other than the castes of these two prominent groups‚Äù. He also said ‚Äoethese rival groups call each other ‚Äoeopponents‚Äù. And the others who don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t belong to either of these groups are called the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>neutral‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> group‚Äù. 

I have seen Bharathi along with Kaviraj who is a well-known figure of the group that is opposed to Prabhu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group. Bharathi had also escaped ragging from the Prabhu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group because he was seen along with Kaviraj. 

It was time for us to leave for our respective classes while Simon decided to stay put in the room till our classes get over. We made it a habit to meet near the English department in the evenings and from there proceed to Archana tea stall and then come back to library. Bharathi likes reading a lot and has also initiated me and Simon into it. 

We left before the other group could come in for campaigning with their set of promises. I had already met Ramkumar. He is a final year student from my department. He is short, dark  and not so well built. He belongs to the Kaviraj group. He called me and Simon the other day and started to narrate abruptly the story of how he and his friends chased and bet Prabhu and his group with sticks in their hands. He also told us that we should be united and counter the opponents whenever they create problem for us. Although I was willing to agree to the idea of uniting to fight against them, my mind refused to be convinced about the story he narrated. I thought, how could these short, and not so well built guys chase and beat those tall, well built and aggressive guys.  Later I had a discussion with Bharathi that evening about the story narrated by the Ramkumar. Apparently, it turned out to be a true story. Of late, I have not been showing inhibition talk these things with Bharathi because we knew we are from the same social background. We found out about each other from the kind of village we hail from. Also Bharathi had the support of Kavraj who is known by his stand and background among the students of the hostel.  Kaviraj had also known me and my background by now. 

Although the other group knew who Bharathi was, they did not know about me and Simon. Bharathi and me believed that Simon must also be from the same background as of ours but never inquired him about his background. All three of us somehow jelled very well. And have been having good time for the past two months. We would be seen together all these time except for our class hours. We also made a routine in the evening to go together for tea after the class and head towards library.  Simon liked spending time with us and we grew confident about him too. 

Things were getting much hotter in the hostel with the two rival groups engaged in fierce campaigning. The news was that Kaviraj‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group has made alliance with some of the people from the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>neutral‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> group.  They supported Deva, a short and sweet looking final year student from English department. We did not know which caste he belonged to, but we knew he was from the neutral group. Deva contested for the General Secretary while Stephen raj who also from the neutral group contested for the Joint secretary.  The other two, Raja and Moorthy from the Kaviraj group contested for the posts of Mess Secretary and Cultural Secretary respectively.  All these men did not look convincing for a voter like me. All most all are short, not so well built. They looked so rustic with their shirts and pants larger than their size and cannot speak English not more than fifteen seconds. Deva was the only exception among them. He looked convincing with his posh looks and sophisticated English. When they approached us for campaigning all that I could think was, how could these guys  kick the warden‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ass if they get elected. 

Kaviraj in the meantime had spoke to me and Bharathi and had asked us to behave casual and not show the other group that we might be supporters of Deva. He also asked us to participate in the meeting organized by Prabhu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group after the dinner. 

Simon felt sleepy after the study hour and he was in no mood to go out of the room. He slept off asking us to attend the meeting. I went along with Bharathi to attend the meeting. Prabhu and Senthil recognized me although they wanted to ignore Bharathi. They knew well who Bharathi was but did not dissuade him from attending the meeting. Prabhu expressed his happiness seeing many attend the meeting. The hosts were really happy and enthusiastic. At least we thought they acted as a good host trying to get us tea and cakes from the tea shop. Some wanted milk, some demanded coffee and, some tea. They also brought cakes, buns and pressed into our hands. I was feeling uneasy to eat or drink those things as my heart was with the other group although I did not know Deva really well. 

Prabhu and his group had roped in some of the people from the neutral group who did not want to associate themselves with Deva to campaign for them. They made us sit in the platform and some of them gave speeches like the way leaders speak during electoral campaign. Kathir, a commerce student, spoke. He said, ‚ÄoeI have known Prabhu for a good number of years since we hail from the same place. He is a good leader. He led the college kabaddi team to victory for the past two years. He is capable of questioning the hostel authority; he has influence at the local political level.  Prabhu can also protect you people from others ragging you. So if you want a better life in David hostel elect my friend Prabhu.‚Äù  I was confused about the connection between kabadi and hostel election. I looked at Bharathi and he was in his usual saintly demeanor, very composed and calm. I could not see even a twitch on his face. He turned to me and gave me that enigmatic smile which iam used to for the past two months. He continued eating and drinking without any sense of guild or remorse. 

Another senior got up to make his speech. He is Jackson, a visually challenged senior student from the English department. He spoke about the virtues of Prabhu and other candidates in his bookish English. I thought Prabhu and his group has been trying every possible ways to attract our votes. The meeting continued with few more speeches on the line. What impressed me the most was the point that every speaker made, in one way or another, about the ability of Prabhu to kick the warden‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ass. 

The group dispersed but with a strong message from the leaders. They said, ‚Äoeyou all have eaten and drank here and please be loyal‚Äù. They also gave us the chit containing the names of their panel of candidates. They also warned us saying that they would easily find out who has votes for them and who has not. I was perturbed and worried about the consequences I might have to face and also my sense of guilt made be restless. I expressed my dilemmas to Bharathi. I said, ‚ÄoeWe should not have attended this meeting. We have now eaten and drank whatever they got us and I feel guilty.‚Äù  Bharathi was quite and seemed focused on his walk gazing the ground than responding to me. After a while of walking he turned to me and said ‚ÄoeWe have to realize that we need not be loyal just because they gave us something. Imagine, if they are ready to give us things now what would they do later to compensate whatever they have spend on us. Also its time for us to think beyond loyalty, enough of being loyal to them for generations‚Äù. He went back to his silent mode after delivering those few intense words. I did not understand much, I went off to bed but i was a bit scared thinking about the consequences if they find out. I even did not get a good sleep that night. 

Unlike the other days, seniors from both the camps knocked our doors very early in the morning and asked us to get ready for voting. Both the groups stood on the corridor facing each other and a voter has to pass through them to the warden‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office which was converted into a voting office that day. Both groups stood opposite to each other sporting stare on the other. We got ready, Bharathi was as usual slow in getting ready. I was prompting them to get ready soon so that we could finish off the ritual of voting early and head to the class. Bharathi was calm as usual and I could see in him the resolve to vote for Deva. I was a bit nervous and sacred. We went to the mess for breakfast and then got back for voting. Both the groups were looking at us. Bharathi looked at kaviraj and went in to the voting booth to vote. It was my turn to go through the corridor with all the stares from both the camps on me. I was about to go and I felt both the groups seemed to want a confirmation from me. I smiled at Prabhu and showed the chit that they gave me last night.  Prabhu nodded his head and sported a friendly smile and when I turned to Deva he looked unhappy and turned his face. I went into booth and quietly pressed the rubber stamps carefully, for I did not want the vote to get invalid. I made sure that the stamp also had enough ink to get a clear print in the voting slip. I imprinted my vote for Deva, Stephen, Raja and Moorthy, and folded the slip carefully and dropped it into the box and headed outside. 

When I went out of the room, Prabhu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group counted on me while Deva‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group counted me a vote less. I did not look at Deva, I just went off  with Bharathi to my department. 

Later in the evening when we returned from our classes there were celebrations all around with Deva being carried around by his supported. I found out that the whole panel of Deva won the election. I could not see anyone from Prabhu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group around. I was told they disappeared soon after the results were out. 

Although I was happy that the group I voted for won the election but I could not overtly express my happiness. I was in a deep dilemma. I did not know which side I belonged to at that moment. On the one side I felt the group I liked had disowned me while other side I thought i could not also associate myself with the group I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t intend to be with. I stood with a sense of loneliness thinking about it when Bharathi said, ‚Äoelets go have tea and then go to library‚Äù.
