*Must be Nothing *(2,609 words) 

He gets furious with anyone spotting him reveal happiness, or relief; the word he prefers. In school, like some of us, he had feigned Catholicism to have an hour outside the classroom, in church out in the woods, to chew bread dipped in wine. He speaks the least, but has quivering needs. In class, as Ms. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Geography‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, the history teacher, inched her body across the chalkboard, drilling into our eyes, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d force a hand to slide through the pocket already torn with a compass during lunchbreak. Most of us shot ourselves; the warm filth gurgling as the world went inside out, at last sputtering out so fast, with such thrust, the eyes become mouths eating into the sky, and only the bell, time, rang us back to shame. This was an everyday ritual; we huddled at the back of the hostel, under the canopy of the banyan, to sniff glue. The more powerless we turned, the more we licked through the dreary cloud wrapping our mouths, licked through time so it slurred, and pulled down our pants to begin the stroking s√©ance. We were small, frozen birds being thawed with a warm pin, one tiny fucking prick at a time, as the bonfire lit by gathered trash went pop and pop. 

I made a plan with him, the two of us. We took a metro to Chandi Chowk and picked up some pirated CDs; anything noisy, but European, and not Nirvana, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d decided, or anything we hadn't heard of. We bought a couple of Kingfishers, split the earphones and headed toward St.Paul‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Convent. The idea was simple: statue yourself outside the gates and wait for someone to perch on you. Or walk back and forth through the crowd exiting the gates hoping something sticks to you. The sunlight like a warm pill under our tongues, he stood beside me, one moment drifting on the beer, away into the tide of wind wrecking through his hair, and in another pulling his entire face back into a void inside himself, as if trying to build up electricity, spitting out a wall of gaze across their path. He saw the girl who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d won the quiz at our annual festival. She stood outside the gift-shop staring at something behind the storefront glass. He turned to her and kept staring until she sensed the burn of a gaze on her back. We took a cab and circled around Lake Gardens thrice before dropping her home, back near the school at Minto Park. They kissed in the backseat, his hand inside her shirt through the centre button, never moving, still, like a stung bird. Before entering her building, she wrote down her number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. When she went out of sight we got off and took a bus to Jadavpur, walking from the depot to his house, picking up more beers and momos on the way. 

Smoke one at the back before we go up? I asked him. 

Past the guard‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s cabin, we ducked beneath the half-shutters of the abandoned garage and slid in to where he had stacked up an awful number of stones inside; small stones which he had also smoothed out. He hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t gathered them all by himself. The garage already had a small pile and he polished that pile and kept adding more till there was no room. Space knows what he gets out of them, but we go back there to smoke a joint and whenever we do, he falls into this vacuous staring, as if desperately trying to force something out of them. And around him, I too feel possessed, and nothing to do, nothing really to understand, I stare with him, and almost sense something, in some remote part of the world, shift, alter. 

When no one opened he pulled out his spare key. On the dining table in a towel, hair matted with fresh dye, was the father. Newspapers of probably the entire past week were spread out across the table. Hi, I said*. *Shaking down the pages from his face, he gave both of us a stray look, nodded his head, and went back to reading. His half-day today, go in, he said*. *The most trying moments for me are the ones right before he dives into the swell, the fucking *alcohole *or as Lowry would say, *alcoholocaust *but he still had some years getting there. Before that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stiff with the sword of nothing packed into his throat. His presence feels as boring as staring at passing clouds or climbing with your eyes the wind circling the tips of distant trees; it takes time, but I think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve nothing as rewarding with something so removed from meaning, from an attempt at meaning. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why when he gets to it, he gets to it quick. 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll get some glasses, I said. 

The father stood bent over the sink in the kitchen, pouring himself some rum. I stepped back behind the curtain, waiting for him to fill up from the tap. He drank it down and slumped back again, staring out of the window. I went over to the hallway and sat on the couch. On the shelf were the regular framed photographs of him when he was younger, his father, mother and sister. There weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too many of them and I kept going back and forth between the same photographs. The sister wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t back from school, and even if she were it would be nothing different from not; no one would know or hear anything. She was terrified of people, their sight, of being seen. 

I got up to check and the father was gone. I rinsed a couple of glasses and went back into the room. An empty bottle rattled close to the edge of the desk, the throb of the subwoofers below shaking the whole woodwork. I sat down at a corner chair, contributing as little as I could to the noise. Seeing me he came over and hugged me, and we fell over. 

More buds and porn? He asked me. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll sneak out the bike and get some CDs from Rahim, he has some new shit. 

Everything had changed. He wanted to do everything, everything that meant nothing to him. 

Give me some money and stay in the hall. Open the door when I knock. 

I knew Giri the guard, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been instructed by his father, wouldn't let him take the bike. 

What about Giri? I asked him. 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have to get him stoned. And rent a fucking CD for him too. So I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll take a little longer. But I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be long. 

I followed him out of the room and into the hallway. I was back on the couch with the photographs, stuff I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d already seen. Looking closely at the photographs this time, I noticed something, or maybe it was boredom. They were snapped on the same couch I was on, but except his father all of them were dressed as if for an occasion, and all of them appeared equally reluctant. His father had the impression of a demonic miner, cigarette in hand, shirt unbuttoned up to the chest, hair in complete disarray, in his eyes a faint, manic rupture. He looked like he could kill something, or maybe had; a small bird or animal, and was now forcing himself, with the others, to do penance. On the shelf were also scattered some books: The History of the Third Reich, a study of Van Gogh, and the collected work of Manik Bandopadhyay. I should try and read that, I told myself, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been trying to get my Bengali together for a long time. I tried for a week every morning with Ananda Bazar, but Bapi Kaku said all that chudur-mudur of newspapers would never get me anywhere. I picked up the book and returned to the couch. It took me some time to realize that I was holding the hardbound tome with its faded orange jacket, as if it were a brick, and still staring at the photographs. Then I heard the knock and put the book back on the shelf. 

C‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>mon, he said. Go in. Giri wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there. 

Give me your binoculars, I said. 

Not now, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s check this out. 

For some time, I said. 

In the cupboard. 

From the window I scanned across the opposite buildings, the terraces. I turned to him; he had put on some Duran Duran and was swirling on the floor, bottle in hand, until he felt dizzy and sat back on the chair, the smoke between his fingers burnt to the bud, head leaning on the sound. 

I want to recite The Charge of the Light Brigade, he said. 

He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d completely messed up that poem in elocution, had messed up the final stanza. 

That fuckpus Biswas didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care anyway, he was busy working his hand up Arun‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s thigh, I said. 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll kill him if he tries that shit with me, he said. 

He hates you, he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. 

I hate that poem. When can their glory fade? 

A woman on the other end on the terrace pulled out clips from a clothesline, and behind her, behind a water-tank, unknown to her, a boy was crouched on his knees, watching her, something held between his closed fist. She kept muttering to herself as she plucked clip after clip, maybe she was singing, but I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear anything. 

Come here, watch this, I said. 

You spot that boy? 

No. 

Look, behind the tank. 

Oh, now I do, but what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s he doing? 

Shit, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gone. 

He ran down the stairs. Let me see. 

What do you think he was doing? 

Who cares? The beers are running out. I could get some...no he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d kill me if he found out. 

Do it, he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know. Load it up with water... he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s drunk anyway. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s do it. 

Walking out to the hallway he staggered while opening the door, a bit out of drunkenness, but mostly out of the urge to play drunk, and I held him up a couple of times, took the bottle of Old Monk from the kitchen, and ran back in. The four o‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>clock sun had fallen through, now sinking down the building‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s west face, and a tiny page of breeze flapped across the window. Fathers were up on terraces with their kids, the sky blotched with kites. 

Want to go fly some? 

Later. Before it gets dark. 

Why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you make one? 

What happened to the poem? 

What happens to a poem? 

After the second drink he dropped to the floor. And after a few minutes of dry, senseless twitches of the body, he sprung back up. 

Want to call her, she gave me her number? 

Fuck that, why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you? 

She gave you her number, she wants you. 

Forget it. No, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s call someone. 

Amit, he said. Curtainboy made me take four laps of the lake for dropping that catch. 

Amit, our cricket coach, also ran a theatre and dance academy. During a performance, where a few of his students, including us, were present, in which he had the part of an effeminate god, he had panicked right before his act and torn down a curtain from the stage, running away with his body draped in it. We called him. Hello, Hello, Amit? Yes? Boka-bal-pordachor-chod-suor.... Ey, ke re, he screamed into the phone. Pordachorchod-silkchod-toke aemon marbo pordachorchod...Tor bap bolchi porda-dhaka-ball-bat-chor. I will police you, he said, if you come in front, Sour-khankir-chele. Curtainboy! Curtainboy! We hung up. We laughed and spilled the drink across the CDs on the floor. We laughed again. 

Gandu, he said, I paid money for these fucks. 

I did, I reminded him. Play the CD. 

Seismic, monotone asses bent over, invading the screen, as Buckley sang of horses through the speakers. Titty-pinched and on all fours, crawling up stairs. Our ethics are straightforward; someone excuses himself to the bathroom, while the other shoots himself in front of the screen, then waits for the other, then goes in and cleans up, while the other... But he was so drunk that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d already pulled down his pants, and when I turned to him he smiled with his whole frizzling body ‚Ä" what?, he asked, and went back to the screen. 

Nothing, nothing. 

An echo, a thick glassy tremor rolled across the floor, quickly followed by another. He pulled himself up, cock throbbing in his fist and no way back now, the thrust wasted, and looked out the window. 

You heard that? Come from outside? 

Not sure, I said. 

Must be that fucking cat coming in through the kitchen, keeps dropping it all. 

Where‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the drink? 

Hold the music, I said. 

Must be nothing. Drink? 

Zipping himself up, he straightened out on the chair, a loose, deliberate smile pasted on his face. 

Hold it for a minute. 

The lashes of kites ripped through my brain. 

Drink? 

You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re holding it. 

Did you hear that again? 

He looked at me, absorbing the sound as we heard it drag across the floor again, and ran out the door. I followed behind him to the kitchen; we looked out the window, we heard a thump again, inside; something struggling, dragging across the floor. He walked up to the bedroom door and put his ear to it*, *calling me in with his hand. I stuck my ear too. He knocked a few times and looked at me. 

What? 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going in, he said. Can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear anything. 

The father lay face down on the ground, not really moving. Without thinking or looking again we flipped him over by the arm. His face looked as if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been dug out from underground gasping for breath, trying to breathe with both his blaring eyes with his face with every inch of him drenched in sweat. He was not fat, but heavily built, and it took all our drunken strength to pull him up by his arms onto the bed. I ran around to the bathroom and wet a towel and spread it across his chest. He kept screaming Baba! Baba! into the father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rolled over eyes, angry, almost disappointed with him, ordering him to get up and get fine. 

But the father didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look fine, he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speak, he flung his arms around to catch anything, and then I saw his face again. He daubed the towel on his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chest, on his face, put his ear to his chest, which side is it on, which side, is this the heart?*, *he asked me, is this the heart?, please, which side is it on? I really didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember what my body was doing. 

I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, I really don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, I said. 

He tapped his hand across the father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chest, knelt on the ground, put his ear on it again. 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll dial the ambulance. Keep your ear on it, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll make a call. 

I had no number, I knew no number, I had no phone. I wanted to be there for him but get out of there. I went down the stairs and asked Giri if he could get an ambulance. He stepped on his bicycle and sped out around the corner. I waited, staring at the sky knotted with kites. The brighter ones were still visible against the twilight, while the ones higher up shook the dark when it cut through the wind. I turned around and looked up at his house, the music still on in my head, humming by itself until the siren of the ambulance slowly enveloped it, but I still couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see it on the road; I could hear it. I heard it coming for a long time.
