Subject: River Swat Was Noisy That Night

Standing in the middle of fast flowing Swat River with his trusted mules, Jonday Khan did not bother the intensity of biting cold waters flowing beneath him at frightening speed just like his father, grandfather or great grandfather! Instead he once again ploughed deep in the water and brought back dark gray wet sand to fill the remaining space in the jute bags, his mules were carrying. He knew that soon the same sand when dried up will turn into light gray and will earn him three hundred rupees per bag. Most of the modern houses and hotels sprawling across the river used his and or his kin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s brought out sand. That used to give Jonday a strange kind of confidence that he will not be out of work, ever. He was possibly right.

That was the time; Mulla Radio was still new in the area. By then he had not started his famous FM radio sermons but Jonday already had experienced how powerful and self-righteous Mulla Radio could be. He knew nothing about 9/11 and ensuing war on terror except that America have attacked Afghanistan again and that America always does that with Muslims, the way this bad mouthed son of local construction contractor who always refused to pay him on time and treated him badly. For some reasons, Jonday always knew in first instance who was treating him badly or who was being kind to him even though he never spoke whenever he visited various places to drop the sandbags as per the order. He could just know from a single glance of other person how he was being taken or perceived. That young modern woman who was staring the river endlessly at the terrace of this hotel whose parking was being plastered and he went there to collect money. He remembered when she noticed his presence as he was waiting outside; she nodded and gave him a smile to greet him. Jonday just looked down and on other side as a matter of respect. He knew, however, that he felt happy being noticed as a person and being treated as a human. Not many rich people especially who lived in Swat respected him the way, that lady did. Although he also knew that probably talking to ladies or feeling happy about them was not a good idea and was possibly not allowed in the religion? Probably not. Except school going young girls, he had not seen many women on streets ever, let alone to talk to them.

For that matter, Jonday remembered it quite clearly that he did not talk meaningfully to anyone ever, nor was he ever asked about anything. Most would just pay him as he delivered them sand without saying a word. There was never a small talk, nor an argument or extension of the conversation. It was only in last elections when somebody just close to election asked him to get ready for the vote next day. Jonday agreed and went next day to the local election office of the candidate from where most voters were being picked and dropped in vehicles arranged by the candidate.

‚ÄoeTell me your vote number‚Äù? A young volunteer came to ask him. Jonday did not know what to say. He stayed quiet. It always worked for him.

‚ÄoeOk give me your national identity card number?‚Äù The young man asked impatiently. Jonday did not have ID card, as well. He never applied for it. He never needed it.

Once the young man realized that, he just lost it completely. ‚ÄoeYou do not have an ID card? How do you use the bank?‚Äù

‚ÄoeI never needed to go to the bank‚Äù He responded.

‚ÄoeSuch a low lifer you are, you do not have anything. Why you came here then. Go.‚Äù

Jonday got up. He knew he was not treated well. More than that, he had the feeling that he could not give what he had promised.

First time after a very long time Jonday felt sad and rejected. Seeing everybody traveling down to polling station and coming back happy, gossiping and laughing, chatting about their voting experiences as he crossed several different groups while taking his mules down to the river. As his mules raced down, he was facing the river; he broke down first slowly and silently and then with a loud voice with tears flowing from his eyes to his cheeks. No one was there to notice, no one to ask. As he washed his face in icy Swat waters, while his back towards the city and the vast river bed in front of him, he this time cried loudly.

Thankfully that day passed and its memory also faded. So did the pain he felt that day. Later, he even thought how childish it was to feel so low for a minor issue. Whoever won or lost was not going to affect him at all. Why to bother specially when he got relatively consistent and long term work with this contractor building hydro electricity project at the river. He heard the word that it was a small hydro project but for him it was quite big. To an extent that he had to work all day to meet up the sand requirements along with others at the project site. In few weeks, due to consistent payments and better rates, he started making some savings. He wanted to finally make one additional brick room in his home. This work was going to really help him achieving that. He started feeling better when on one fine day he saw rows of trucks lined up close to the project unloading this whitish muddy sand in very large quantities. As he unloaded his two bags from his two mules, he heard chief engineer, he was already familiar with, telling his assistant they should stop local sand providers now because they were not needed.

Jonday heard all of this and instantly realized that the use of muddy impure sand was not going to easily mesh with cement which in turn will weaken the whole structure. He had no courage to talk directly to the Chief Engineer nor did he remember that his words have changed anything ever and yet this was an important matter. A weaker, faulty building was not going to resist Swat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s powerful waters.

‚ÄoeOur sand work way better with cement. The one being offloaded now will not be mixable‚Äù. Finally he heard himself saying rather abruptly to the Chief Engineer. He was not sure how loud was he but in retrospect he later thought that he was speaking with full force of his lungs partly to sound better in wake of noisy Swat waters and partly because he was nervous.

The Chief Engineer looked at this dark shadowy figure and his two mules and did not attempt to respond. Rather his assistant intervened:

‚ÄoeSir do not mind him. He is just an ordinary worker here and do not have manners to know how to talk to officers‚Äù. With this he almost frisked Jonday away from the Chief Engineer.

‚ÄoeNo I am not wrong. Listen, I can show you that‚Äù. Jonday kept saying to the assistant while being taken away.

‚ÄoeDo not talk about things you do not know‚Äù. The assistant again said and Jonday did not know what happened to him and how gathered the courage but he grabbed the assistant from his neck and squeezed his head under his arm and kept saying , ‚ÄoeI know how sand works, I know. I know. I know‚Äù.

In less than a minute several laborers and workers gathered and took the assistant away from Jonday and thrashed him well. The assistant also slapped him hard on his face and kept on beating. Chief Engineer was away but reached there from inside and like a judge told him in low voice.

‚ÄoeGet lost and never come back‚Äù. And then he moved to his assistant and said ‚ÄoeDo not pay him anything. He does not deserve that and let me know if he try to come back or threaten you. We will send simply put him in jail‚Äù.

The moment they loosened their grip, Jonday freed himself and ran towards the river, everything in front of him looked blurred. He even forgot his mules still at the hydro station site. He wanted to run away from there. Far and far. Further far.

In weeks of despair after that in which he returned to his work quietly and was seen moving up and down to the river along with his mules, many local gossipers would whisper as he passed them discussing how much was he thrashed by employees of the local hydro project and that he had to run without even being paid from there. Some even tried to ask the details from a Jonday when he visited them to buy grocery and other such stuff. Jonday knew most of these queries were not to empathize with him but were being asked to further tease him.

It was one of these days, when he saw Mulla Radio emerging from his madrassa riding on a horse and moving with dozens of other horsemen first in the bazaars of Mingora and then on the road along the river in fast speed moving towards Fiza Ghut. His real name was not Mulla Radio but after setting up this local radio channels in which he was giving sermons on daily basis saying that in this Godless society, only divine rules can bring peace and justice and that Justice was not possible without Sharia. Soon they started running their order and evening court which people would attend in large numbers and few people would present their case, which were heard and decided there and then.

The day Jonday presented himself in the court saying that the local hydro company is not paying him for long, the Mulla ordered his horsemen to go and fetch the employees there and then. Seeing the proud assistant and his accomplices being arrested by Mulla Radio‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s force was very heartwarming for Jonday. The assistant confessed and promised to return Jonday‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s money in next few days and the crowd cheered.

‚ÄoeAre you satisfied Jonday‚Äù? Mulla asked. Jonday suddenly find a sudden surge of courage and respect for himself he never had.

‚ÄoeThey had beaten me hard that day sir‚Äù.

‚ÄoeIs that correct?‚Äù The Mulla asked from the assistant. The assistant stayed quiet but nodded in affirmative.

‚ÄoeNo one can beat his fellow Muslim, specially the weaker ones. So I ask Jonday to beat him thirty lashes‚Äù. Mulla declared the verdict and amidst crowd cheering, all Jonday remember now was the volley of lashes he was able to hit the assistant on his back. With each one he felt a new lease of life coming in him. He was a new man, from now.

A week or more and all hell broke loose all of a sudden. While Jonday got back his money and pride and started his work again, he remembered slowly tourists stopped coming, several barber shops being closed down and finally the girls‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> school close to the river, he always saw open and full of girls now closed and giving a deserted look, making even Jonday sad. Like the sound of the flowing water, every day he was used to children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voices coming from the backdrop. One day coming back from the main city area, he saw bullet ridden two bodies lynched with the pole in the main Mingora town chowk. Jonday got so confused; he started beating his mules again and again and moved through the deserted bazaar without giving a second look to the bodies. Everybody talked how ruthless Mulla Radio and his men were and they talked about how Taliban have taken over Swat valley.

Army came in next week and operation started. The whole town had to be evacuated. The whole town. Everything was closed. It was like a ghost town now. Except Jonday who nobody asked to leave. He and his mules could not have even a day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rest because he now had to work every day to provide sandbags for the army pickets. Day and night. Everybody was very busy. There was a fight every day. He could hear gunshots, all the time.

One night in possibly second or third week of the fighting, Swat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s weather was unusually very hot. Even his mules started feeling unrest. They were not calm as they normally used to be and were stretching hard, wanting to untie themselves. Although it was very late at night, his patience could not last long. He knew his mules will need a stroll close to their favorite river side and feel the cold wind on their skins and relax there. Even Jonday felt better in mild moonlight and vast darkness of this noisy river. As his eyes accustomed more with the area, he saw a dark object, surely a woman slowly moving towards the river. Jonday ignored her for a while but then he started worrying. He had spent his life time in the river and only he knew its directions inside the water, its ups and down and could easily cross it with his mules. Any other person just cannot cross it on its own. The water‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s speed can sweep you away in no time. Even Jonday remained careful while in the river and always rode his mule when to go further deep. He knew if he won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop the women, she will be drowned. He took his most powerful of the mule and went inside the river, quickly reached close to her. The women stopped and looked towards her from her shuttle cock burqa. In way it was surreal and scary there in the middle of the river in the darkness of the night.

‚ÄoeCome back. The river will drown you‚Äù. Jonday said.

Instead the woman came close to him and suddenly Jonday saw her taking out a gun from the burqa and a man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice emerging out of her ‚Äoestay quiet and handover your mule to me‚Äù.

Without a doubt it was the voice of Mulla Radio.

Jonday forgot everything. The military operation, the lynched bodies, closed deserted schools and a military operation aiming to arrest an extremist, somebody who has challenged the state. All he remembered was the day when Mulla Radio restored his honor, helped him got back his money and allowed him to take revenge from that assistant of the hydro engineer.

‚ÄoeYou can take the mule but you would not be able to cross the river. You do not know the way. Only we know paths in fast running waters of Swat‚Äù. Jonday said.

Mulla Radio nodded his head, did not take off his burqa but sat behind Jonday on his mule as it started walking inside the river. Jonday took a longer but less risky rout along the river bank avoiding military pickets which were away but still visible few furlongs away on the main road. Two miles away from Fizzaghut from where they started, Jonday lead his mule towards a dense bush starting from the river and going up in the mountains. He disembarked Mullah Radio there, who disappeared in trees still in his shuttle cock, not even once looking back.
