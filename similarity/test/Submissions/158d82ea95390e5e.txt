Both you and Leela had said that you liked it more as you read. Is it strong enough to feature in Dec issue is the question.

*Bill Murray for a day * 

It won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be entirely incorrect to say that Bill Murray is the reason for my hangover today. You see, I am not exactly the party going sort of person. I prefer to spend my evenings watching football and drinking beer. Sometimes I call a few friends over, and we watch football and drink beer. That or I sleep. If it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t for the thoughtful man who invented the alarm clock, I would have spent the majority of my life in a fitful slumber. 

But yesterday Bill Murray convinced me to go to a party. I was in office. It was 8 pm and work was about to finish. I was waiting to sign some artworks when I stumbled across an article online. It was about Bill Murray and his irreverent ways. It described how Mr. Murray regularly turned up uninvited at random parties and other gigs. How he believed in living every moment to the fullest. One particular sentence caught my eye - *You must make yourself available for life to happen to you. *Those words, individually rather harmless, but strung together in that particular order, shattered my plans of going home, drinking beer and watching Arnab Goswami annihilate Indian politicians. I was suddenly infused by a desire to live my life. To not let it drift by. I decided to be Bill Murray for a day. 

But there was a problem, I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a movie star. Nobody would be glad that I came to their party uninvited. It was at that point of time that Mark Zuckerberg came to my rescue. God bless you Mark and your weird book of faces idea. I scrolled down my timeline to see if any of my friends were at a party somewhere. The odds were good because it was Friday night. The greatest night of the week for humanity; a night when people break off their chains of slavery for 2 days and 2 nights to drown themselves in alcohol, engage in mass pelvis thrusting and have mindless coitus. 48 hours of unbridled joy before 5 days of sadness and misery. A fair trade I would say. 

Bill‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words were already coming true. I had made myself available to life by searching for a party, and life gave me a party. A friend of mine, Gattu, was having an open house party in GK 1. It was there as an event on the book of faces. I clicked on the Going button and dropped Gattu a message that I would see her in an hour. I was excited. I could feel life surge through my normally calm veins. 

By 8.30 I was out of the office. It was a BYOB gig so I went to the theka right next to my office. I decided to be classy like Mr. Murray and buy some expensive whiskey, not Suntory expensive, but decent enough. After hearing the prices of a few scotches I settled on a bottle of Blender‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Pride. Copywriters aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t paid like Hollywood actors you see. 

My office cab dropped me in front of the M block market. The house where the party was taking place was a short walk from there. I walked, holding the box of Blender‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pride securely in my hands. I had this strange fear that someone would come on a bike and snatch the bottle. My fears were unfounded. Who in their right mind would risk life and limb for a bottle of Blender‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pride? 

I was walking on the road looking for house number M-24 when I heard loud music and saw some people smoking and jiving on a 2nd floor balcony. I went near the gate of that house and sure enough, it was M-24. I climbed up the stairs. Two flights later I stood in front of a large mahogany door throbbing with music. For all my Murrayness, as I neared the door behind which the party was in full throttle, I began to panic. I hardly knew anyone in there. What if I opened the door, went in and everybody just stared at me? I decided to call Gattu. After a few painfully long rings, it dawned on me that she obviously couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear her phone in all that cacophony. Screw you loud party music. I asked myself to take deep breaths, open the door and just calmly walk in. Before I could put my Zen thoughts into action, the door opened and two people came out talking loudly. I had my window. I lunged at the door but just before I could reach it, it closed mercilessly. That was it. I decided that the Murray way of life wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t for me. I began to descend the stairs. 

It seems like God really wanted me to party that night. As I climbed down the flight of stairs, Gattu called. I asked her to come open the door for me. She staggered out of the door half drunk and we hugged. This was it. I was about to enter the party. I followed her past the dark brown door, into the belly of the beast. 

It was madness. There were people in every nook and cranny of the house. The main door had led us into the living room. I spotted the dining table which was serving as the makeshift bar. It was full of all kinds of alcohol. There were a lot of cool people around. By cool, I mean kids whose parents had enough money for them to choose what they wanted to do in life. These were the kids who were enjoying the benefits of Manmohan Singh‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s economic policies. There were writers, photographers, artists, designers and an odd engineer or two. I knew I had to get drunk quickly if I was going to survive. So, I dashed into the kitchen and picked up a plastic glass. I made a large whiskey. Put in some soda and ice and gulped it down. I repeated the procedure, only this time I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t gulp down the drink. I took it outside into the balcony, lit a cigarette and sipped the whiskey calmly. 

I was much calmer now. It struck me that the music being played was stuck in the 90s. Ghosts of bands past were haunting me. The playlist included N‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>sync, Backstreet boys and my favorite band from the 90s ‚Ä" Savage garden. I was about to stub my cigarette when I heard Gattu shouting my name. I went inside and saw her standing with 3 or 4 other people I knew. One of them was a talented photographer who had once asked me to model for him as a chef. The others were her friends who I had met at her legendary roof top get-togethers. I went in and said my hellos to everyone. 

We all started to dance to the 90s music. When I mentioned this to Gattu she looked at me as if I was a moron of the first order and said, ‚ÄoeYes, it is 90s music because that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the theme of the party.‚Äù 

Anyway, I was feeling much more at home now that I had bumped into a few people I knew. I was piling on the whiskey generously. The living room dance floor turned to a muddy football pitch in England every half an hour because people kept spilling their drinks. I was guilty of that a few times as well.  A wiper was brought into action when the floor became impossible to dance on. And so it continued; the alternate dancing and wiping. 

The music was being controlled by a handsome Caucasian man. In his lap sat a beautiful Indian girl. They looked like a couple very much in love. I noticed that they did not have any drinks. The Murrayness was surging through my veins and I asked them to drink up. A sober DJ was no good for the party. They were slightly amused at my vociferous pleadings for them to be given alcohol and politely refused. So, I decided to abandon them and go relieve my bladder. I opened the door of the bathroom to find a girl in an orange spaghetti top and trying to close the buttons of her shorts. I apologized quickly but she said there was no need, she was done. She walked out of the bathroom calmly. I went inside still a little in shock at having walked in on her. I double checked the bolt of the bathroom from inside before letting out a wonderful stream of whiskey piss. 

Back in the party I made another whiskey and decided to join the rest of the humanity in a bit of pelvic thrusting. In the middle of copying someone else‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s steps I met another old acquaintance. His name was Robin. We were mutual friends with a wonderful and crazy girl who was studying art therapy in Bangalore. We chatted for a bit and Robin told me to quit my job and write. I told him I was contemplating that, but there were issues of bread, butter and a roof to be sorted out. Robin told me he wanted to become a dancer. This was the reason he was pushing people to do what they wanted to do. So that he would have company. I told him I would try. 

The crowd at the party was now tired with cute boy bands of the 90s. At any party in India, no matter how arty or posh, after a few drinks have been downed there has to be Bollywood music. The white DJ looked desperately for his girlfriend who had abandoned him at the mercy of a drunk and demanding crowd. Thankfully, she resurfaced just in time to play ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Choli ke piche kya hai‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. The crowd went berserk. Men were slicing their chests open with hand gestures. Women were being naughty. I was living life. 

After dancing for a bit I made another drink and stood next to the fridge. A pretty girl in a black dress with a carefully casual denim jacket thrown over it came there looking for water. She had short curly hair, dimples and a pleasant face. We got talking. It turned out she was a copywriter as well. Instantly my mind started constructing a wonderful domestic life with her as my wife. 

I know that escalated quickly, but we men are fools in love, and in general. I felt Bill telling me. This is your moment. Carpe Diem. Seize the day, and the woman. As I thought of upping my flirting game by employing one of the top 10 pickup lines Google had suggested she said, ‚ÄoeOh great! You work in CLA. My boyfriend is going to head your Creative Department from next month.‚Äù I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I quite heard what she said after ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>My boyfriend‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> very clearly. I told her I would come right back after making another drink. 

I was standing in the corner fuming and blaming God when he sent another pretty creature my way. ‚ÄoeI know you from somewhere‚Äù, she said. For the life of me I could not remember how I knew her. I hazarded a guess which as miles off the mark. Both of us sat there trying to figure out how we knew each other. It was quite a futile exercise and we decided to move on and let each other know if either one remembered. I had lost my plastic glass with the sorrow killing medicine in it, so I decided to enter the kitchen to get another one. There were a couple of people there. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what came over me but I suddenly shouted, ‚ÄoeNeruda or Bukowski.‚Äù Most of them looked at me as if I was crazy. One of them calmly replied, ‚ÄoeBukowski.‚Äù 

By now, I was quite high. I went to the balcony to smoke another cigarette. I had to cross the dance floor where a man in his late 30s was dancing with the orange spaghetti girl. Lust was writ large on his face as he twisted and turned the girl. I somehow crossed them and lit a cigarette in the balcony. 

It was around 3 in the night now and the party was petering out slowly. A few drunk people were lying here and there in the rooms. Most of the people were booking cabs and saying goodbyes. The girls who had been flirting with us were now safely in the arms of their lovers. Their love had survived another night. I was sitting with Gattu and we were talking about something which seemed serious then, but I cannot recall what it was now. After a while I booked a cab as well. 

It had been an interesting experience. Meeting new people and talking to them. But by the end of it all I was exhausted; by the dancing, by the drinking, by the talking. As I sat into the cab I heard Bill‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice in my head, ‚ÄoeThis is just the beginning. More life waits for you in unknown bars, in loud clubs with swinging sweaty bodies, in the all-night open thekas of Gurgaon, in random house parties.‚Äù I respectfully considered Bill's advice. Then, I thanked him for the night out and headed back home, towards my beer, my couch, my football and my solitude.
