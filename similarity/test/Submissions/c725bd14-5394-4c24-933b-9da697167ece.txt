She looked around the brightly lit room.

The straight backed chairs previously occupied by 4 are now empty.

Being an interview for both positions, of a teacher and a warden, only few appeared.

While she waited for another candidate giving her personal interview inside the room, the rest left.

Nervousness?

No.

Just a restlessness to get it over and done with. So that she can look for another one.



Few minutes later-

The woman from the room came outside. Her face ..blank.

A grim nod and she gone.

It will be her turn now.

She adjusted the folder in her hands and looked at the watch.

6.30 PM. The girls can hold on for an hour more.

‚ÄoeMiss Asha,‚Äù the attendant called.

Smoothing the sides of her kurti, dropping the pinned up dupatta straight backwards, she moved.

A brisk knock and she entered.

Two gentlemen and a lady glanced up at her, from the papers they were looking at.

A stunningly beautiful woman, with a simple ponytail,white printed kurti, a demurely adjusted dupatta and a black salwar glanced back at them.

‚ÄoeAsha?‚Äù

‚ÄoeYes Sirs, Ma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>am.‚Äù

‚ÄoePlease have your seat.‚Äù

Folder on the table, she sat straight.

Her application form was being looked over carefully.

‚ÄoeThanks for responding. We got yours on the last date.‚Äù

One of them spoke, ‚ÄoeThough your experience is limited. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s varied.‚Äù

‚ÄoeYou served in 4 States in 3 years!‚Äù

‚ÄoeAnd from Orissa to Mt. Abu is a long way‚Äù

‚ÄoeYes sir‚Äù she replied. The slight flaring of her nostrils betrayed her nervousness which she is beginning to feel at last.

The one looking at the application form asked without looking up:

‚ÄoeYou have not mentioned your surname, religion or caste.‚Äù

The lady looked at her with genuine curiosity and said ‚ÄoeActually this is what made us call you.‚Äù

A slight hesitation later...Asha spoke up

‚ÄoeSir, I come from a community wherewe don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have surnames.And my name is not Asha in real. I was born as Monalisa.‚Äù

‚ÄoeThen? You changed your name? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄoeWhat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s your community that doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t allow you to keep a surname, a title or a caste?‚Äù

‚ÄoeSir, I am from the Bisar Community of Orissa.‚Äù

The name just popping out suddenly didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ring a bell. Theylooked blank.

‚ÄoeSir..we are born to trade..flesh trade. We are workers of sex.‚Äù

The trio gasped.

‚ÄoeSir, if you allowme a few minutes of your time I can clarify, speak up. What made Monalisa of Bisar, Bhubaneswar become Asha and what desperation drove her to apply for a job in this place so far from my home.‚Äù

They looked at one another. The verdict was already made. Outcome of the interview decided, when she spoke of what she was.

‚ÄoeSir, Ma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>am please hear me out for once. She pleaded.‚Äù

Her eyes brimming with unshed tears, she looked at them with hope.

I lost even before I started..Asha thought.

And time‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s running out.

The three of them looked at each other.

But..a few minutes is what she was asking for.

One came out grudgingly..

‚ÄoeOk. Carry on. But make it brief.‚Äù

And thus Asha started speaking.



************************************************************ ***************************************

‚ÄoeI was born Monalisa.



I belong to a community in Orissa. We are called Bisars. Around 100 of our familieslive in a small place, just near the highway in Bhubaneswar. You can see our houses while entering into the city from Cuttack.

We have pipelines, electricity, timber, grocery, snack shops and a tunnel which connects us to industrial and educational hub of the city.

The tunnel served dual purpose. A playground for the community kids inthe daytime and a place for customer bargaining during the dark.

Birth of a girl is celebrated, with coins and dancing and all night melodies.

It means money..the more beautiful and alluring the girl is, the more she will fetch for the family.

My mother was an extremely beautiful woman. By 15, she started as an extra in Oriya films.

A director decided to make her an extra in his life. So she returned back to the roots, with a 3 month pregnancy and infrequent visits by the director.

He maintained her well. So no cause for complaint from my Grandmother who retired from the profession by then.

The first born to my mother was a son.

No great celebrations here. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already decided by peers long back...

If the boy studies or is remotely intelligent, he will become a contractor or else a pimp.

5 years later, when my mom was 23 she was pregnant with me.

By then, the Director lost interest and the infrequent visits stopped.

Luckily for my mother... I was a girl, thus her pension ensured ...she started entertaining other men.

The first word most of us learned was ‚ÄoeCustomer‚Äù

He may be for anyone, but has to be treated with respect and usually he is God.

My childhood was spent playing in the tunnel, running errands for the customers, learn dancing and knowing when to be quiet.

It was elections time in a year and the Ward Councilor of the area suddenly came in...demanded us to be sent to school.

So, when I was 5 and my brother 10, we attended school for the first time.

The teacher said, I had a good head for both numbers and languages which was a rarity.

I continued my studies for the next 3 years, intermittently bunking school whenever it was necessary for me to perform item numbers and shows.

My brother displayed no such talent... so became a sort of bully instead.

After all, he had his job cut out. He can always pimp me.

The Ward Councilor lost her elections, and I lost my education.

Among all the customers of my mother there was this Professor who used to spend many a nights and was habituated to reading before he slept.

The books were lying everywhere, and sensing my interest, he started teaching me English.

I picked it up real fast and started reading small stories and books much to his amusement.

At 13...I menstruated. A sign that I am ready for the initiation and hence the occasion was celebrated with great pomp by my now too old grandmother.

For a year, I was completely groomed to take over the trade. My reading continued courtesy the Professor.

Two things happened when I was 14.

My initiation by a wealthy prominent man and a new woman into my family.

No, not another daughter for my mom.

My brother with his extremely good looks and attitude managed to lure a girl to become his girlfriend and she, an engineering student, blinded by her love got pregnant and hence, into our home she came.

She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect the kind of community we lived in, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect our lifestyle.

My brother led her to believe that he is the son of a film director and with his flashy clothes and bike, she thought him to be from an affluent home.

The baby got aborted and so did her life.

Anyhow, once her parents refused to take her back,& having nowhere else to go she tried to adjust.

In our homes, the daughter in laws were not into the trade. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only us daughters who were the bread winners.

She and I, forged a bondwhich grew fast andstrong.

She encouraged me to study, togive 10th privately. Even bought the books and started coaching me.

My brother though a bully, in the new flush of married life agreed to whatever she said.

Thus at 17, I gave my 10th. Barely passed. But it was enough for me.

The next year, I got pregnant and with nothing to do for almost a year, I started studying for +2 and gave the exams.

Kusum, my sister in law managed to convince her husband and my family that being educated will be more in demand.

She started working at a small place

Anyhow I passed.

Bythen, Kusum was also pregnant and both of us delivered our daughters almost at the same time.

More cause for celebration.

By then, my zeal for studies increased. My mother, grandmother and bhai were apprehensive.

By then, my mother was almost without any customers or income and all my bhai could do was pimp me.

I promised them income from my trade and they agreed for my graduation.

I joined an open university and finished the graduation in 3 years.

Seeing me, many young girls of my community started to take interest in studies and many even finished their 10th.

Sensing a rebellion, my community decided to clamp us all and it turned the area into a ghetto where the girls were literally locked up.

Kusum decided toleave Bhai.

So, she and I planned to run away and start our life where I need not use my body to bring in money.

We hoarded up whatever we could in the form of jewelry and cash and decided on a day to leave the place

We even decided on the place to run away to.

Bhai sensed it somehow.

Killed Kusum.

Meanwhile, I had the two girls and the hoard with me.

I ran to Visakhapatnam with my certificates as planned.

Pleaded, begged and convinced a school Principal to take me as a nanny in her day boarding school

My coverup was I am a young widow with two daughters.

In return to cleaning and looking after kids, I was given shelter and food.

With the help of teachers there, I did by B.Ed.

By then, Bhai came to knowmy whereabouts.

I needed to run again.

I went to another city, another state.

Everywhere, the story is the same. I start as a widow and ended up being known as a runaway prostitute.

So now this is the reason I wanted to tell the truth about myself.

I am tired.

Of running, of the need to explain and my failure in convincing that I want to live respectfully without using myself.

My bhai may not come this far.

And if he does, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to go back, run or give him the girls.

I want to stand up to him.

I wanted to carve a life for myself and the kids.

I want the kids to live the way they want..not to do what others decree.

For all this,

I need a shelter and a job desperately.‚Äù Asha concluded.

Silence.

The lady said-

‚ÄoeAsha wait outside. We need to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄoeOne thing sir..

it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Asha.

They looked at her.

‚ÄoeSir, dissent always starts with one person.

Rebels make revolutions.

We need to start with something small to bring about a big change.

Kusum named me Asha.. a beacon of hope for my community. For people like me.

Who never had a chance to live a decent living. We, who had to bare our bodies and bear the burdens.

We..we are always treated as scum, the left overs of the earth.

Fit for the garbage bin.

But,we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re seldom given a chance to climb out of the pit.

I want the women of my community to hope, to dream, to think..big or small and to stop using their body as business material.,

I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t say, how many Ashas will come out of my community.

But,if I go back there will be none.‚Äù



She waited.

Was called after 15 minutes.

The twinkle in their eyes belied their intention.

A smile hovered around the corners when one of them stood up and said

‚ÄoeCongratulations! We were not taking you as warden but as a school teacher. And we have decided to allot you a residential quarter immediately.

There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s round the clock security and a Police check post.

You can join your daughters in the school.

For them, the name of their mother will be enough.‚Äù

Hope smiled.

Asha flew.
