*The Stage Of The Spirit* 

by Willem Myra 

The Magician announces that he's going to make the man disappear. That Pallid Fellow Over There, who volunteered for the act, sits on a chair at the center of the stage. All lights are pointed on his sweaty brow. He smiles, shyly, and waves at the people he came to see the show with. 

Are you ready, the Magician asks with more eagerness than Busta Rhymes' passion for hip hop. That Pallid Fellow mutters affirmatively. Ladies and gentlemen, says the Magician now facing the audience, may the show begin! 

The Flirty Assistantâ€"blond, thirty-two-teeth smile, stockingsâ€"makes her entrance pushing a man-sized mirror on wheels. She arranges it in such a way both That Pallid Fellow and the audience can look into it. She bows, The Flirty Assistant, giggles, then is off. 

The lights get low. The background atmosphere music nobody was aware of shifts into a suspenseful beat. The Magician pronounces the magic words. Sim sala bim! Or magicabula bibbidi bobbidi bu! Or some other funny-sounding made-up phrase. The surface of the mirror starts trembling like wind-caught sheets. There's a flicker. There's some static. And just like that the mirror turns into a window on universes twins with our own. Everybody in the audience is speechless. That Pallid Fellow watches as other versions of himself appear on the enchanted screen one at the time. They are different from one another, these look-alikes. There's one who is dressed better. One who is chubbier. One is a father. One suffers from bruxism. One lost an eye. One has a wicked smile. One shakes hundreds of hands at a public event. One has a husband. 

Our Pallid Fellow studies them bug-eyed and incredulous. How are they me, how is this possible, what? he would like to shout, but doesn't, for he is an educated gentleman and knows how to keep his cool even when the fabric of reality crumbles. 

The Flirty Assistant comes back followed by eight equally flirtatious girls, each of whom pushing a wobbly wooden wheeled table. On each table sits an old-school, red rotary-dial telephone. Not a cordless, yet wireless nonetheless. The girls arrange the red telephones around Our Pallid Fellow and conclude the task by lifting their left legs in the air like they're '50s movie stars and they've just passionately kissed the square-jawed main character. 

This is what I want you to do, says the Magician. One of the phones is going to ring. Drin, drin, drinâ€"just like that. I want you to pick up and have a chat with your doppelganger. One at a time. Does that sound good to you? 

When the telephone does eventually ring, Our Pallid Fellow picks up with confidence. Hello, he says. Yeah, that's also *my* name. By god, certainly. And it's all we and the audience hear, for the Magician has the control room cut off the sound. Let's give him some privacy, all right, fellas, the Magician says. He's now sat in the front row, enjoying the show like he's an average Joe himself. 

The phone call lasts ten minutes, give or take, leaving Our Pallid Fellow ghastlier, sweatier. A second telephone starts ringing right away. And twenty minutes later, a third. Then a fourth. A fifth. And so on, until Our Pallid Fellow has shared anecdotes with all his parallel selves. 

It's past midnight. Everyone is silent and attentive. Not one blinking eye. Not one yawning mouth. Our Pallid Fellow stands up, staring ahead. Arms hanging loose. Sloping Victorian shoulders. He stares mutely, like a kitten who's seen a shadow moving on the wall. And stares. And stares. Every so often Our Pallid Fellow licks his lips, swallows saliva. His pupils follow a ceiling-to-the-ground then left-to-right pattern. He's a flesh-made machine. After three days of doing this, he whispers a single word, Usurper, shakes his head, and lies down on the stage in the fetal position. 

Some Pallid Fellow sleeps for a whole week during which the audience stays seated and awaits. The denouement is close, you can actually smell it. When A Pallid Fellow wakes up, he isn't himself anymore. He stares at the mirror but he does not see doppelgangers. All he sees is a skin-and-bones man wearing a dirty white tee-shirt, with a scraggly beard, uncombed hair, and a know-it-all grin. 

My name is John Doe no more, the Man says, introducing himself to the audience for the first time. He makes an elegant curtsy, left hand on his belly, right one in the air; ankles crossed. 

The NOW IT'S THE RIGHT TIME FOR AN APPLAUSE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! sign bleeds red and does so for a long, long time. The audience is happy to clap louder than anybody ever did, for the Magician has indeed made the man disappear as they knew him. Bravo, bravo, bravo, comes a sea of voices from the seats. The Magician gets on stage, bows respectfully too. 

Once the one-trick show comes to an end, the audience disperses. Some of them see the performance as a conversation starter to use next time they're in an awkward situation; some, poor souls, forget about it before hitting the bed. Others, however, strip naked and in their dimly-lit bathrooms pray their half-body mirrors to show them who they could've turned into, to show them their best selves, their lesser selves, their not-quite-themselves-but-almost selves. But the mirrors, it is known, are stubborn beings, deaf to human desires. Therefore they show nothing, sucking in all the light and turning black. SMOOTH PIECE OF GLASS THAT REFLECTS IMAGES TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. 

Bummer, The Naked People think before sighing in unison. They shake the mirrors to no avail. They are left alone, craving a once-in-a-lifetime metamorphosis yet lacking the know-how to jump-start it. Caged inside their incompletion.
