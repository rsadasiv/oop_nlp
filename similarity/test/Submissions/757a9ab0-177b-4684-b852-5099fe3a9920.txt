Abra ka Dabra, for a long time now, had enjoyed the reputation of a village where sadness did not exist. Any air of melancholia would halt at the boundaries of Abra ka Dabra, and only after shedding its melancholy will it dare to pass through its lands. One may call it an ancient village, because it was untouched by technology, untouched by the government, untouched by foreign lands. It did not allow travelers to enter, and natives to migrate. The village had its own way to sustain itself, and every act of adventure to disrupt its happiness had met with terrible fate. It is not something you would like to know. A chill passes through my spine just at the thought of those terrible things. The point is, nobody dared, and village was left for itself, isolated, lonely, like a segregated island. 

Happiness was the only thing that was taught in school (two fours are two! Children, smile and be happy saying this!) , and followed in the house (Hey, can you please happily make a cup of tea for your father?), and celebrated in the festivals [people are happy during the festivals anyway], and expressed on deaths (Oh! I was so happy to hear about the death of your beloved mother). It was not something that people strived to achieve, it was simply their way of living. Every emotion had to be transformed into happiness. None of the other emotions had a place to be expressed in this village.

Almost four generations in this village had no problem living, and carrying on like this. At least, they still had a memory of feelings that were not strictly happy. But problems began with the fifth generation. It was the first generation, which was, in truest sense, happy. It was born happy, and grew up happy, and that was the only emotion it knew.

Hari belonged to this problematic generation. He was the one who started all this mess.

One day, to everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s surprise, Hari started crying. The entire village was shocked. His parents asked him the reason. He would not speak. His friends asked him the reason. He stayed silent. The bigshots in the village came to him and asked him the reason. He still did not utter a word, but kept crying.

Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father, and Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s teacher were the people who were worried the most. They both thought they failed in teaching him the art of transforming other emotions into happiness.

‚ÄoeWhat happened beta Hari? Why would you cry? You know how happy everything around you is. What could be the reason to cry? Nobody cries in this village. Everyone smiles. See. Like this.‚Äù Teacher said, and then smiled his big, wide, ugly smile, showing his half broken teeth.

‚ÄoeYes beta! Why would you do this to yourself? Smile. My good boy you are, aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you? Smile. Common.‚Äù His father said.

His friends offered to play with him. They offered him to bat for the entire day, while they bowled. They offered him sweets. They offered to carry him on their backs and give him a ride of the entire village. But Hari, who was crying quite naturally till now, suddenly seemed to cry more deliberately and obstinately at this.

The big-shots of the village were worried. An urgent meeting was held in a temple. Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father was also invited to attend.

‚ÄoeWe are in trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄoeYes! Big time.‚Äù

‚ÄoeFor the first time, someone from the village itself is not ready to be happy. For the first time, an insider is a problem for us.‚Äù

At this, Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father got defensive.

‚ÄoeActually, he has not yet fully mastered the art of transforming other emotions. It will come. He is still young.‚Äù

‚ÄoeBut didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you see? He was almost forcefully crying. He just refused to stop. And he wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even tell us the reason.‚Äù

‚ÄoeI know. But he will learn. I think we need to give him some more time.‚Äù

The big-shots looked at each other. They were equally lost. Until Hari, there was no need for law and judicial system. Everyone in that village lived peacefully. There were no fights, no misunderstanding, no ugliness. Village survived through the mutual understanding of its natives.

But what to do now? What can one possibly do when someone refuses to be happy?

‚ÄoeOkay. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s give him two days. If he is not normal again, then we might have to take some steps.‚Äù One of the big-shots happily said. The meeting was dispersed.

Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father was tensed. He returned home.

‚ÄoeHari! You need to be happy Beta. To not be happy is a serious matter, you know. We can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be happy here if we are not happy. At least tell us what made you cry, so that we can tell you what to do. Please.‚Äù

Looking at his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s pleading face, Hari finally broke his silence.

‚ÄoeThat day, I was walking back from school. I accidentally stepped on a lizard. It was tiny. It died. I suddenly felt something, something terrible. I did not know what I felt, I only knew it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happiness. I cried, and I felt so free. Happiness did not feel even half as good as this freedom did.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWhat? Son, do you have any idea about the dangerous results your words could yield? ‚Äoe

‚ÄoeNo. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWill you promise to be happy now?‚Äù His father asked.

‚ÄoeNow? Not at all. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to be happy. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boring. I would like to cry when I want to.‚Äù Hari said. His father sighed.

The big-shots met again after two days.

‚ÄoeHari is still sad. And sadness is contagious. It could spread, it will spread. But before it does, I think we should end it.‚Äù

‚ÄoeHow?‚Äù

‚ÄoeWe might have to take some severe steps. But before that, we should listen to what Hari says.‚Äù

And thus, a judiciary system was set up. Three big-shots were all set to question Hari. He sat before them, in the public *chowk* of the village.

‚ÄoeBeta Hari, tell us. Why are you refusing to be happy?‚Äù

‚ÄoeI am better this way.‚Äù

‚ÄoeThe entire world is running after happiness. You are so fortunate to be born in this village. Our village is famous precisely for this reason. Here, you are nothing but happy.‚Äù

‚ÄoeI know.‚Äù

‚ÄoeWhy did you dare to disturb it?‚Äù

‚ÄoeHonestly, I am happier this way.‚Äù

‚ÄoeBy being sad?‚Äù

‚ÄoeYes. By being sad.‚Äù

The big shots again rolled their eyes. They were unable to understand this paradox.

I too was present in the chowk. I could see their discomfort. Even they cannot be angry or irritated with Hari. They had to tackle him happily, and that was getting more and more difficult for them, thanks to Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s answers.

One of the big shots smiled and said: ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t talk rubbish. Being happy by being sad does not mean anything. In this village, you either stay happy, or you die.‚Äù

There was an uncomfortable silence in the entire chowk. As far as I could remember, Abra ka Dabra had not experienced such a silence in years. A crow flew over us, then one more, and then there were lots. Everyone knew what it meant.

And yet, nobody spoke a word.



*

Soon, the day was announced with utmost happiness- the day when Hari would be hanged in the public chowk.

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>This boy has to be sacrificed. We shall all remember him, not as a model, but as an example of disloyalty towards the village. Anything that attempts to disrupt the joyful mood and peace of Abra ka Dabra, needs to be sacrificed.‚Äù This was their announcement, which they made quite happily.

Some people were made messengers, and were sent with this message in each and every house of the village. They were greeted happily, and they delivered the message with a smile. It was very awkward when they came to Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house.

They were unable to utter a word. They tried, but their words were stuck in their mouths.

‚ÄoeHari‚Ä¶.sacrifice‚Ä¶‚Äù one of them tried too hard to speak.

‚ÄoeYes. We know that. I will be there, to be sacrificed. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. Thank You.‚Äù Hari said. He was smiling.

They went away. They did not look quite happy. Neither did Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family. And some other people in the village. Big shots were right. Sadness is contagious. It was spreading. It had to be destroyed at any cost.



*

Finally, the day arrived. The *chowk *was full of people. Men and women, young and old, everyone came to attend the grand event of Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hanging.

I turned around and looked at everyone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s faces. Each face was smiling, trying to look happy. Just by the look of it, I knew. I knew that the damage was done. Abra ka Dabra will never be the same again.

Hari stood on a platform right at the center of the *chowk. *There was a chair beside him, and above the chair, was the rope with the noose. A little further from him, stood one of the big-shots. He was standing there to address the crowd.

He started-

‚ÄoeLadies and Gentlemen, as we are all aware, we are here to hang Hari, who attempted to disturb the happiness of this village, this very village, where our forefathers nourished and sustained it, and left us with the responsibility to do the same. It is our duty to fulfill this responsibility, and destroy every element that comes in the way of it. Let this hanging be a message to all those who ever wish or think to commit the mistake of coming in the way of Abra ka Dabra.‚Äù

‚ÄoeAnd now, let me ask Hari for his last wishes.‚Äù The big shot turned towards Hari, who was smiling at him.

‚ÄoeBeta, any last wishes?‚Äù

Hari shook his head.

‚ÄoeYou sure?‚Äù

Hari nodded.

‚ÄoeOkay then. While Hari hangs himself, I would like each and every one present here to cheer this event, and welcome this gesture with utmost happiness. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want a crying or a complaining face. I want cheerful faces, I want loud laughter, I want a delightful uproar.‚Äù

No one could go against the Big shot‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s command, not even Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family. The entire crowd started laughing, loudly, while Hari stood on the chair. When he tied the rope around his neck, the crowd laughed and hooted; when he tightened the noose, the crowd shouted and whistled; when he kicked the chair, the crowd made loud noises and started clapping-

People continued laughing, they were so engrossed in the laughter that tears started flowing from their eyes, their delightful uproar reached a level of obsessive frenzy, until Hari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes popped out, and his legs, which were shaking so vigorously for some minutes, finally stopped and came to a peaceful halt.
