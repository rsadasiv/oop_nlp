Bio: I live in Bangalore and work as a freelance writer. My blogs http://methodicallymadme.blogspot.in/ and http://noonewriteway.tumblr.com/ are my vent though most of my writing finds life within the pages of four mood books. My writing has appeared on The Colors of My Soul, an online writing community. 

*When the pendulum swings* 

The fumes rose with heightened tenacity. Their greenness reminded one of neon lights noiselessly bound to tree branches, the leaves turning fluorescent in the dead dark of night. These fumes, they were poisonous, threatening to kill anybody that came their way. Now, they raced upwards, aiming for the young woman's body pasted to the ceiling ‚Ä" like it were splayed on the floor. A swirl, pungent in its message of guaranteed death, entered her nostrils. She gasped. 

Moyna woke up to a heart that beat so wildly, she thought she had heard the pounding on drums. She reacted to the faint sensations on her neck. There were beads of sweat hanging on to dear life. The massive bed-for-two had been left meant-for-one. 

The night outside hung heavy. A solitary bird somewhere cried out in sporadic shrill. ‚ÄoeSomeone like me,‚Äù Moyna comforted herself, stretching her arms around herself in a tight band. 

Moyna remembered her last conversation with Neel, as he used his delicate fingers to stuff sheaves of paper into an old shoe box. He was preparing to travel in half a day. 

‚ÄoeNeel, I feel I'm sinking. My breath is playing truant.‚Äù 

He stopped in his tracks and lifted his eyes to look at Moyna, who sat leaning against the sliding door leading to the garden. Her eyes, sorrowful stones, were set deep in her skull. Her left hand rose and fell, occasionally breaking into an ungainly twitch. 

Neel walked up to where Moyna sat and dropped himself down on his haunches. With a quick dance of fingers, he moved some stray hair falling close over Moyna's eyes. 

‚ÄoeI can see it is being difficult for you. But you also need to understand this is work. There is no way I can break myself away from this. You are among the few who would know what I mean‚Äù 

Moyna sighed. 

‚ÄoeI have never questioned you about what you do and why you do it the way you do. But every time, I think of you walking away, without me by your side, something happens to me.‚Äù 

She paused. Her chest, holding all the dead-weight, found it difficult to rise against the crashing waves of breath. Once upon a time, when her days were as murky as moonless nights, a man had come her way. She did not know if he had a heart of gold. But he did have the patience to soften scars so deep, she almost thought she had suffered them over lifetimes. A loveless childhood and an abuse-filled marriage did seem like many lives lived. 

‚ÄoeGo, Neel, go. I will deal with it like I always have.‚Äù 

And so, Neel had gone. He had flown across a queer, grey sky with spots of bright here and there ‚Ä" never to come back again. 

--- 

It had been difficult to describe, that sensation of one's life not being one's own. 

‚ÄoeI want to grow old with you Neel. I just hope I will.‚Äù 

Despite the doubt, death had been a miscalculation. And, Moyna had sleepwalked through weeks, half-hoping Neel would walk in, a lazy smile conveying his happiness. The man had saved  Moyna in ways describing would fail.. She had been a wreck,  calling up more shrinks than she could manage to visit, most of whom she avoided after the third visit. Not Neel. And, the day she decided she would marry him, she knew why. 

*‚ÄoeDon't hold on with a death grip Moyna. Let go. It is just a matter of time‚Äù* 

Neel's hypnotic command had traversed through clenched fists, locked jaws and a palpitating heart. While shudders, screams and suicide threats almost snuffed precious life out, Moyna's true being came out from behind the curtains. No, the tightrope walk might not end ever, but there was hope. 

*The river had run dry but it knew the sea was nearby. * 

Something about Neel, though, made Moyna unsure. He could read her mind but she could not read his. 

‚ÄoeI think a lot, Moyna, and that makes it so much more difficult for me to utter everything that passes through me. So you will need to be specific. Ask me and I will try to answer you.‚Äù 

Those weren't unreasonable words but they invariably put a lid on Moyna's inquisitions. 

‚ÄoeI am not your shrink and I am not going to ask you questions‚Äù would be her robotic snap of an answer. 

How difficult was it for a psychologist to sieve ill-formed ideas in his mind? If he needed questions like everybody else, what better was he? 

--- 

One chilly winter morning, with the fog enveloping from all sides, they sat huddled many miles away from home. Hundreds of acres of Eucalyptus trees stretched out before them, frozen still, waiting for a signal to waft their fragrance. 

‚ÄoeSanity and insanity are never opposites for me. They're the same. You walk them, you fall, you get up, only to fall again.‚Äù 

The frosty air, lifting in a synchronised dance, made it impossible for Neel to bring out the bumps in emotion he experienced. His words came out in quivering bursts. Moyna had her eyes fixed on him, even as he searched for some horizon to catch through cracks among the trees. 

Like any other relationship, theirs too had a secret code. Each knew a version of it but did not have the courage to ask if the other had the same one. They hoped for their versions to have an uncanny resemblance, all the while knowing that that was highly improbable. If the high point in one was doubt, in the other it was hesitation. That's where the blinders in the mind helped. 

‚ÄoeIs there something you'd like to tell me?‚Äù 

*That dreaded combination of words. * 

How many times had Neel heard them? And how many times had he pretended he had not heard them?  This time around, he felt responsible. His thoughts were clear like pebbles seen resting underneath a steady, slow-flowing stream in the mountains. The words hung in his head, ready to jump. They could change their lives forever. Did he wish they would? 

‚ÄoeWhat would you like to hear?‚Äù 

A barb? 

‚ÄoeNothing.‚Äù 

The truth remained, precariously suspended from the drifting clouds in the distance. 

--- 

Ever since they had moved into No. 22, the trunk had stood in the room behind the bottle green door. Neel had been overtly protective about it, requesting the movers to carry it into the house, first thing. 

*‚Äoe*My childhood is in there and I need to be able to go back to it.*‚Äù* 

Meant as a joke, that stayed in the air for a while before one of the men smiled widely. Moyna exactly knew what that meant; she who had willingly lost all the emblems of a little life once lived, knew what that meant. 

And then, a week after, Nadia  had called. She who never quite approved of Moyna. Her dislike was like the fog and people, even those who saw, spoke and heard nothing but the good, noticed. At social gatherings, the air between them would turn to ice, without the ensuing promise of thawing. Speculation was rife but Nadia was beyond explaining. 

‚ÄoeI will not take up a lot of your time.‚Äù 

All she wanted were specific photographs from their childhood. Her baby brother gone, she needed ‚Äoeat least something‚Äù to cling on to. Moyna had just listened, not lunging to erect walls and keep the enemy at bay. Nadia had sped through the details in a bid to escape what was meant to be a conversation but had not turned into one. 

And that was that. 

------- 

A few days before Neel stood stuffing sheaves of paper into an old shoe box, they had sat together. Neel sat on his haunches staring at the open trunk, busily sorting things in neat piles. Moyna sat looking at the play having assumed the sombre attentiveness of a rapt audience. 

‚ÄoeDid I tell you about the time Daddo pushed me into the pool while we were holidaying in Goa?‚Äù 

No, he had not told her. But she had known. Nadia had passingly mentioned it to her when they were groping in the dark, not knowing what to think of each other at well-lit family dinners. 

The incident had left a distinct trail on Neel's mind. This was what had forced him to love water and hate Daddo. 

‚ÄoeYes, you told me. I know that story by heart.‚Äù She had stormed out of the room soon after and Neel had not even followed her, demanding an explanation. Instead, he had not spoken a word the rest of that day. But the trunk had stood majestic, reflecting a methodical glory that carried Neel's mental imprint. 

----- 

But now that Neel was a dead man, the trunk and its surrounding space had been abruptly abandoned. Moyna had asked the maid to seal the lock with thick tape. After all, it had not been her who had wanted to set foot in that direction every other day. 

------ 

Photos from Poorni Auntie's fiftieth birthday, Nadia had mentioned. And some from 'The Canterbury Tales', a high school play that Neel had won for at a state theatre fest. Every other particular had receded into the back lanes of memory. Sixty five days and seventeen hours had lapsed since that first phone call. Much like the stronghold of a fortress wall looming large, allowing not even a peeping hole to consider victory. Nadia had called three more times, twice among which she had tried masking her urgency (and had failed miserably). As for the third and last time, Nadia had hung up in exactly a minute and thirty two seconds. The coldness of the receiver, though, had lingered on in Moyna's hands. There was no escape from the past. Her alter ego had bawled while she had sat, steel in her eyes and iron in her veins. 

In the end, she had pulled herself up till the hallway and switched on the solitary light. The first time after Neel's death, the corridor had seen something other than darkness. 

Her next steps burnt her feet and raided her heart. 

But at last, the lock looked less like a continuing wound as the mass of tape was flung to the ground. 

----- 

The chest of memories stands unattended, Moyna's inner eye afraid to even throw a glance. Let it be, let it be, a voice meddles. Are you not going to pay heed to the many requests I've made you, another quips in. The window, left slightly ajar, allows a sharp ray of sun straight on to the chest. 

‚ÄoeHow difficult was it to allow the room absolute darkness?‚Äù 

Moyna unfurls the limp electricity bill behind which she had methodically jotted down Nadia's list. Why had she not come and pored over the bits and chunks of sentimental possession herself? 

The little notebook full of words scratched out. The familiar brown of textbook wrap, having grown old with stars small and big, drawn all over. The dog-eared school yearbook with a half-smiling Neel occupying the corner dedicated to the 'School Captain of the Year'. Every postcard Nadia had ever sent after she went to some faraway land to attend college. Crumpled gift paper stashed to a corner, upholding the memory of lost loves. This one Moyna takes into her hand, caressing it slightly. But before the blue shininess of it can propel her into a past neatly tucked away, she notices a thin book. 

It reads: *The Wrath of the Wrestler*. 

She cannot remember anymore if she had seen Neel carry the book around. She shakes her head and grabs the 100-odd pages stuck together, cowering next to a stack of old documents on scientific experiments. It looks like it was bought off the street, with pages repeated and the publisher's note missing. Something Moyna would never pick even if she were aimlessly strolling through a street full of sellers selling their wares on brightly coloured cloth, fast picking up dust. Only if there was not planted carelessly between the pages what looked like a photograph. All that Moyna can see of it is the arm dressed in the sleeve of a pale blue sweater. Stuck at an angle, the photograph reveals face towards the top. The faint outline of a smile that Neel never left behind. Her fingers rush forth to pluck it like fruit. 

What emerges is a wilderness so ancient, Moyna imagines seeing the gleam of wolf eyes in it. 

------ 

What? Thirty one years? Or more? Home was disaster with Mummy threatening to walk out on Daddy and little Moyna every day. The maids secretly sniggered and tables took the blows of pent-up anger. Soon after, Daddy asked Mummy to leave. Bags were packed and more abuses flung. When the car whirred into life on the pathway next to the garden, Moyna was nowhere to be seen. 

Five years of motherlesness later, Moyna had her emotions altered by a curly-haired, apple-faced senior who had joined school mid-year. From the many whisperings, she gathered he was from the hills. She experienced a smugness about having her heart leap at the sight of him. But there could be no harm in letting him know she thought of him more than she thought of anyone else. 

The beastly strength of a humid summer was upon the city. And Moyna feared the deftly stolen box of liquor chocolates would quickly turn into mud pie. She waited under the coconut tree behind the school, face striated with sweat. She sniffed hard to see if rejection would come her way. 

‚ÄoeLet me get back and keep the box in the fridge.‚Äù 

Just then, she saw him emerge from the big road ahead. She saw the other boys in the distance, having strategically placed themselves near the bakery. They did not look too interested. He walked up to her and shoved the box into her hand lightning-quick. It looked as gift-wrapped and unexplored as it was when she was carefully placing it into her bag three days ago. Their eyes met for a brief second before he abruptly swung around. 

That evening, Daddy lost his cool over the mud pie. 

----- 

They never met again. 

But they did sit a few seats apart from each other at the airport. Something about the garland of words that floated towards her despite the monotonous stream of announcements, made her look in his direction. His hand motioned to space as he agitatedly spoke into the phone. The birds, the rivers, the mountains and everything else that had accompanied him in Moyna's thoughts years ago came back. He sat only five strides away. But the lightness of anonymity could not be half as compelling as the heaviness of recognition. Soon, the phone call was over and Moyna buried herself  in her book. The rabbit had been on the run, desperately seeking a hole to stuff its head in. And then, it had found what it wanted. 

So, as it happened, they never met again. 

----- 

The photograph looks recent. The corners are sharp and there are no meandering creases. The two men have their heads touching each other's, much like swaying trees on a windy day. Neel, for once, does not  seem to care much for a controlled twist of the mouth. He grins from ear to ear, his arm squeezing the arm of the other. Had it not been for the mammoth shades, Moyna would have recognised the latter right away. 

‚Äoe*What sets him really really really apart from everyone else is that speck.*‚Äù 

Who had said this when she had passingly mentioned her fascination for the boy from the hills? She doesn't want to remember anymore. The pitch dark mole sits on the right top corner of his mouth, providing testimony for Moyna's teenage yen for acceptance. She thumbs through the book, wrath in the distance, set on speeding wheels. A square pink of post-it, relieved from its temporary job as bookmark, reveals. 

*I had a cabin by the lake* 

*Where I would go fishing every day* 

*As the sun rose and the sun set* 

*Jewels would come drifting my way* 

*The biggest fish there heard me * 

*Gasp and cry much to their dismay* 

*For I wanted none of it* 

*And wished it all would go away* 

*But that is also where I found you* 

*I'd be a fool not to say. * 

-        *Bikram* 

----- 

Nadia's phone keeps ringing. 

If she had taken the call, she would know her long awaited parcel will reach her in three days. There would also be something else, something she may not have been able to decipher. 

‚ÄoeCan I tell you something? Forgetting has suddenly become more painful than ever.‚Äù 

Meanwhile, the young woman's body would remain pasted to the ceiling, tears wasting in the corners of her eyes. The pungent fumes would snake into her, but life would not be snuffed out. She would keep watching until the stars would take their positions in the night sky and the maid's fervent calls to dinner would break Moyna's maudlin sense of time. 

‚Ä" The End ‚Ä"
