I will always remember the first time I saw her. It was a week after my parents had settled me into the sparse dorm room that I would be sharing with four other girls. My mother had arranged the strolley full of my clothes on the most easily accessible shelf jutting from the newly whitewashed walls. She placed the bucket purchased at the Big Bazaar in the town under my bed on which she had spread a simple, clean bedsheet. She stuck the small mirror that she had remembered to bring along at the last moment on the handle of the iron window-frame next to my bed and looked around, clearly dissatisfied. She let out a small sigh, told me to be good and went outside to our car where my father had been left standing after the warden informed him that no men, not even fathers soon to be bereft of their daughters, were allowed inside. So, he had spent the last hour considering the lush monsoon greenery on the hills in the distance. The goodbyes were dispensed with efficiently‚Ä" my mother had not let a single tear-drop escape her welled-up eyes and my father had pointed to the small all-purpose shop right in front of the hostel remarking appreciatively at the convenience. I had not cried. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that I was too excited to begin my new life in pursuit of an engineering degree. I had simply accepted the fact that the next four years of my life would pass here the same way I used to accept the news that we were moving to a new city because my father had been transferred: It happened every five years, was to be endured and there was nothing I could do about it.

She had rushed past me on the staircase, startling me at the landing window where I had spent the last half-hour self-satisfactorily gazing at the twilight. I had hurriedly straightened up, preparing my mouth to utter the words Good Evening Ma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>am. Just the evening before a senior had stopped me in the mess to ask me why I had not ‚Äoewished‚Äù her and shared a comment on the increasing arrogance of ‚Äoeaajkal k bacche‚Äù with her friend before allowing me to leave. This was an age old tradition: all first years were to stop in their tracks if they saw a senior approaching and wish good whatever-the-time-of-day-it-was. It was done to us and eventually we did it to others. We also called our seniors Sir and Ma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>am. She however seemed least interested in my little curtsy. As she quickly climbed upstairs, two steps at a time, I caught a glimpse of the red strands in her long dark hair and the clasp of her bra outrageously visible against her brown back barely covered by the curtain fringes I thought she wore as a top. Over the next few days she kept appearing on my visual horizon like a dark, rain-heavy cloud clearly distinct from the drab grey surrounding it.

From what I could tell she mostly stayed in her room coming out for meals in the mess or to receive delivery from the canteen at the hostel door often dressed in nothing more than an oversize shirt. This immensely annoyed the shrill-voiced warden who never confronted her choosing to lend her judgements to eager first years instead. On some evenings I would spot her strolling along the untarred roads of the campus with her boyfriend like every couple on campus. The first years who had not acquired boyfriends yet, would cluster outside the hostel within the area where ankle revealing capris were allowed and assess the couples. There was nothing to do on those pink, windswept evenings but amuse ourselves with the couples dotting the uneven brown and green spread of the campus like pointers of all that you could be in the years to come. At curfew time, the guard outside the hostel gate would give out two loud whistles within five minutes of each other. Two shrill reminders for every girl wandering outside that it was time to return to safety behind doors that would now be locked from the inside. One evening when she turned up among the girls trapped outside the locked door because they were a few minutes late the warden extracted her gleeful revenge. At times like these the warden would snarl perversely, her stony black eyes glinting while she denounced them in a voice raised seemingly to the Gods for only He could understand her annoyance at these wayward girls. I watched from the safety of the hostel lobby, resenting the unfairness of the practice but at the same time feeling relieved that I was not one of them. I felt embarrassed for her as if I had accidentally walked into her stripping for her boyfriend. The warden always relented eventually. She opened the doors and asked every girl to sign her name in red ink on a white sheet that she claimed would go to the head warden. With a nonchalant wave she swept it aside and walked away leaving the warden muttering under her breath. I felt vindicated.

Even after all this she never seemed to get into any real trouble. The first time she came close was when I was in the second year. Even though the days of ‚Äoewishing‚Äù our seniors were long over, I could not bring myself to talk to her. My friend N was as intimidated by her but that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop her from talking to her or expounding her opinions in front of her. N also had many more points of access to the groups of senior girls who invited her to their rooms in the upper floors. N first heard it there and I heard it from her. A group of fourth years, her classmates, had decided to register a complaint about people smoking in the small enclosure near the permanently shuttered door to the terrace. It was the safest place to smoke in a hostel full of non-smokers. They had decided not to name anybody but everyone knew who would be the first person to be implicated. I felt a quickening anger rise within me even though I only borrowed puffs while N smoked there. ‚ÄoeBoys smoke openly in their hostels‚Äù, I insisted. ‚ÄoeFirst, they are all a bunch of prudes plus they just don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like her‚Äù she shrugged.

Nothing much came out of the complaint apart from an empty scare one evening which made N scramble to her room to hide her packet of milds deep inside the trunk below her bed. However, no checks happened. Nobody smoked near the shuttered door anymore at least not during waking hours. N had started smoking alone late at night and because she would often run into her there, they were becoming friendly. Every morning as we walked to class N would tell me some new piece of information that she had attained the previous night. I was glad of this new spring of knowledge but I could not help but feel pricks of envy even though they were only stories of debaucheries in the boys‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> hostel and the lesser scandals of the girls‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> hostel. Hearing them from N only left me feeling uncool first for not being a part of them and then for not even hearing about them from somebody who had.

Around this time, the second floor common room which had been under construction for as long as I could remember was opened to us. It had a large balcony attached to it and for the first time we had something like a small terrace to ourselves. Not many people seemed to realise its worth as it was attached to a large empty common room that didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have lights in its sockets or glass on its windows. This only meant more freedom for smokers. All secret alcohol parties came there to die with a last smoke being passed around under the light of the moon that had been kept from us for so long. It was there that I came to know her finally. There I started smoking properly after she chided me for wasting her cigarettes and it was there that she agreed to N‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s demand for a joint which I also smoked. N and I would often waste our evenings there listening to songs on N‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shuffle and dissecting texts from boys. On days when she could stay longer than the duration of a smoke, the scene transformed. With her stories our little world expanded. It came into its own within the larger world outside. It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ugly, it had character. The ludicrous morality of a small town‚Ä"stifling as it was‚Ä" transformed into comic fodder as in the story where she ends up being chased by stick wielding villagers for enjoying a countryside date with her boyfriend. They also revealed ways in which it accommodated questionable behavior within its grimy fold like the restaurant that would draw curtains for lustful students looking for a respite or the popular hotel which surreptitiously served alcohol in rooms where the doors displayed a notice which read ‚ÄoeAlcohol and Meat not allowed within premises‚Äù. Of course the stories we liked best were closer home like the time in her first year when all unsupervised visits to town were permanently suspended for girls because of a grisly murder nearby. They had sat outside the hostel from morning to night, refusing to go inside until it was repealed. She made that mediocre college in just another small town a place to wage battles from.

One morning after class I made my way to the common room to get the lighter that I seemed to have left there. I had been walking with my eyes glued to my phone and was almost hit by the door when I reached. I was taken aback as the door was never shut. I looked down and found a huge lock at the bolt. N and I spent the day trying to rectify what seemed like an administrative mistake but the warden informed us with perverse pleasure that it was decided after a faculty member had seen girls sitting on the concrete boundary walls of the balcony. With a nasty smile she told us we could try writing to the head warden but nothing would come of it. It was all done. We rushed to her room for advice because we couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just accept it and do nothing but she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there. We realized she had aptitude tests for campus placements all day and had to leave for an interview the next day. Nobody around us seemed to share our outrage. Exams were around the corner and there were better things to do than mope about a lost piece of sky. That night as we gloomily pored over Digital and Integrated Analog Circuits I had a passing thought. When it remained stuck in my head even after I had moved on from Class A amplifier to Class B amplifier, I had to tell N.

‚ÄoeMaybe we should just break the lock‚Äù I said lightly.

She laughed with me.

‚ÄoeIf you think about it seriously it shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be difficult‚Äù I persisted, testing the waters.

She looked at me with one raised eyebrow and said‚Äù Yea sure so that they can break us tomorrow‚Äù.

‚ÄoeNobody would know of course!‚Äù I said getting excited.

‚ÄoeDo you even know how to break a lock?‚Äù She mocked

‚ÄoeWhy do you think we have an internet connection?‚Äù I retorted

She stared at me with her lips pursed and her head bobbing slightly as it did when she decided to keep still for a moment to consider a problem. Then she gave me a big smile and opened her laptop.
