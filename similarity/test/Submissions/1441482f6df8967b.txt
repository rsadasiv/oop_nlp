*THE PAPER BOAT* 

We've had this old and faded photograph with us for a number of years in our family photo album. It is the picture of my maternal grandfather. I remember my grandmother quite well because a larger part of my childhood was spent in her house in Thakurnagar after she had been widowed. I used to be very fond of her and can recall that I enjoyed her special affection for me over my cousins. 

In the photograph, my grandfather is seated in a chair, at the bottom of the long steps of our small cottage in Chittaranjan, where we lived then. He has me in his arms and I think I must have been merely one or two months old then. We were there in the shadows thrown by a large coconut tree which is not in the picture. I can tell it was a coconut tree by seeing the crown of the pinnately compound long fronds. The picture had turned yellow over the years and there is a spot of damp at the corner. 

My grandfather was a slim, trim man. He didn't keep a drooping moustache like most men of his age did in the late eighties and early nineties. He looked unwell in the photo. My mother tells me that he had a strong personality. This time when I looked into his eyes I was immediately struck by the confidence that radiated out of them. 

There isn't much detail that I remember about my grandfather. He died when I was five years old. Someone had called up to give the news of his demise and the following day I left with my mother to see him for the last time. 

I have the nitty-gritty of my grandfather's house fresh in mind. It was huge and covered a great part of land by the pond that was behind it. I reached the place with my mother for his funeral. It was in the month of July and the air had the sweet smell of wet mud. I remember the tall trees and the fresh air distinctly of that place. Every time I visited Thakurnagar, I felt a strong connection with the trees that lined the narrow road. Whenever the trees saw me, they moved as if to turn in my direction. 

A strong wind was blowing and it felt really very cold and seemed so unfamiliar and bizarre. But the trees remembered me. They bowed gently in the breeze... and called me nearer, welcoming me. 

We walked past the pond. I don't remember seeing the water level higher than that ever. The water was clear and reflected the large, evergreen, spirally arranged leaves at the top of the stems of the palm trees. The wind was gone and it was all silent again. The ducks communicated by loud and sharp scaups. While some shy ones made quieter contact calls. They all gathered near the pond. 

As soon as I entered the house the smell of sandalwood had intoxicated me. I went in a state of trance. There was a huge photo of my grandfather in the main hall and garlands around it and many people inside the house... I don't remember seeing most of them again. But what I remember very clearly till date is my grandfather's inanimate form... his eyes closed, sandalwood dots on the forehead, his body covered in a large white cloth, showing his feet. There were two tiny cotton balls inside his nostrils. He looked so peaceful that day, free of every tension, every confusion in the world. I had never seen anyone like that before. My mind was filled with questions. I understood that that wasn't the right time to ask. I had never seen my mother cry the way she did that day. She hugged my grandfather for a long time before someone made her sit back. I stood at the corner of the hall, obviously shocked. I felt like crying too. 

I looked across the hall. My grandmother was sitting at the other end, near the wall. She covered her face with both her hands. I couldn't make out if she was crying. I couldn't see her face. As I looked around the room I saw few familiar faces... I chose to let everyone mourn and kept my questions with me. I don't think I knew then what death meant. This I remember because of Gokul Kaka and what he had told me the following day. Gokul Kaka had been my grandfather's neighbor for quite many years. 

Someone took me inside, I can't remember who. I found my cousins there... jolly, unlike the people inside the hall. I doubt if any of them were aware of what happened to my grandfather. They're all of my age, roughly. They called me inside and we started playing among ourselves. Somehow, I always found the company of cousins more fascinating than that of friends. We played all day and I forgot about what happened earlier that day inside the hall. 

That night I slept beside my mother. I woke up in the middle of the night. She was crying. I didn't call her but stayed awake for hours, I remember, lying by her side, listening to her. I wanted to ask her a lot of things at that hour in the night. Every time I made an attempt, I stopped myself. I kept wondering, as the insects made the buzzing noise in the silence of the night... as my mother poured out her heart and wetted the pillow. I noticed a small drop of tear forming at the corner of my eyes. 

The next morning as soon as the sun peaked through the trees that lined the pond, the clouds covered the sky. My grandfather's photo was still there in the main hall and there were people always coming in with flower garlands and small packets of sweet. My grandfather was no longer lying on the floor. My cousins were still asleep in another room. I couldn't, anymore, bear the burning sensation of my vague concept of things that were happening. I wanted to leave my mother alone. She was up very early that morning. I ran down the long sky blue steps, past the trees, three pines, a straggling oak and a huge mango. Gokul Kaka was standing against the rough and gnarled trunk of an oak tree. He was a middle aged short man, who always wore impeccable white trousers and preferred to leave the upper part of his body bare. His hair was greying towards the temples near his forehead and behind his ears. He wore glasses with a thick, black frame. His study was filled with books. I still don't know if he had read them all. He could sing... not very well, but very loud. Especially when he took bath every day in the evening in the pond. He was a great entertainer. Kids loved him for his effortless mimicry of animals and humans even. Once, I can recall, he had mimicked my grandmother and how she used to wake up every morning and complain about the cold water, short winter days, rising prices or about some tenant who used a lot of water the previous day or dirtied the lawn. 

I asked him about my grandfather and that I couldn't understand why he was lying like that in the hall the other day. He said that my grandfather was gone into the waters, of ponds and lakes and seas and oceans and I believed him at once because he was the most credulous person I knew then. He was a nice man and a great story teller. The stories, when combined with his narration, always looked as good as true. I was almost convinced why the water level was higher than ever. I learnt from Gokul Kaka that those packets and garlands were for my grandfather so that he would return from the waters. I looked towards the way to the pond. I was determined to bring him back. 

I ran back home through the lawn. The grass beneath the cherry tree had water at the tip which touched my legs. The sunrays sparkled like diamonds through the leaves of the trees. The main hall now had more people praying over my grandfather to bring him back. I slowly moved inside, to the room where I had kept my bag. I had just learnt how paper boats were made by folding paper. Our strict art and craft teacher made me do it ten times before it came out perfectly. I made a small paper boat out of an old newspaper that was lying on the wooden table at the corner of the room near the door. I folded and refolded the newspaper again and again till I was convinced that it was strong enough to sail in the water through wind, rain and turbulent conditions till it reached its destination. It came out beautifully. My teacher would've been proud of me had she seen it. I don't remember having made a better paper boat again. I took out a small paper from my writing pad and wrote in clear bold letters: "I MISS YOU. COME BACK". 

I walked out of the main hall. I made sure that my mother didn't notice me. She was already upset and had lots of work. I was glad that she didn't find me as I sneaked out of the house. The sky had changed its sunny mood by then. The clouds looked like incorrigible monsters, spread all over it. My heart began pumping fast since I had to return before it started raining. I walked fast. I wished that I could meet Gokul Kaka on my way. I kept looking around as I walked. I reached the pond. Gokul Kaka was not there with me. The water was calm. I looked at the letter and quickly scribbled the word "SOON" at the end of it. I folded the letter and placed it inside the boat. The ducks weren't there. The image of the palm leaves on the water was dull and unclear. It was an unusual day. The leaves were still... the sun had hidden behind the clouds. I looked around. I sailed the boat in the water and watched it as it moved away from me. It reached the center of the pond. All of a sudden, a storm rose. I ran to the nearest tree and hugged it tightly. There was dust everywhere and soon some of it went into my eyes. I shut my eyes with my hands. The wind was there for a little while. 

After some time, the gushing sound of the wind, the loud bang of window panes, the rubbing noise of the leaves... all of those were gone. And when it was silent again, I rubbed my eyes. I looked for the paper boat in the pond. I couldn't see it! The paper boat wasn't there... it went to my grandfather, perhaps, I thought. I went back to the house before it was late. 

I don't usually go through old photos and albums. But now that I did I was glad since I sailed through a sweet memory of my grandfather, a remarkable person I remember so little about. 

Of course, I've grown up over the years now. I've seen numerous deaths since the first one. I certainly know what death means now. But this wonderful journey through this memory made me think again. I wondered the purpose of the wind out of nowhere on a bright and sunny day. I wondered if the paper boat could ever reach him. This might be an insensible thing to expect, I thought, but then who knows what happens after one dies. I closed the album. And as I walked towards my bed to call the day off, the last puff of the wind brought from the villages, the scent of damp mud, and whispered the words into my ears, "I miss you too". 

*COVER LETTER* 

Family photos many times form a part of our reality because often those glossy papers are the only sources of captured memories. "The Paper Boat" is the story of a little girl grows up into a lady without too many memories of her dead grandfather. One day she comes across an old and faded photograph and goes through a flash back of memories. She wonders if the paper boat could reach her grandfather across the waters in the storm. 

The word count of the story is 2009. My contact information is given below:
