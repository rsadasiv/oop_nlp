A  VILLAGE  LOST  IN  TIME 

My birthday fell between the end of viva and the start of theory exams in the second year of college. As usual, I had no intention of celebrating it but GPRS (Garima â€" Pinky â€" Renu â€" Sonam) wanted to come to campus to wish me. They brought gifts for me, my first birthday gifts. 

Garima gifted me a small Laughing Buddha statue -- Pinky, a foldable pen-holder-cum-stationary box -- Renu, a pink-coloured decoration plate, its periphery surrounded by pink and yellow flowers and in the middle was a tiny-minny, super-cute female teddy bear in tight jump-suit and ribboned hair emerging from a window out of a giant apple, with these words engraved below: 

â€<sup>~</sup>You are closer to WE heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Because of too much pink, I never had the courage to decorate my study table with that beautiful plate. Pink is allegedly a gay colour and if you possess it in any form in our hostel, you become the butt of homo jokes. 

Sonam didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t come but she sent me a ball pen, which was not even wrapped in gift paper. I doubted the girls mustâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve bought it on the way and lied that it was from Sonam. She had gifted me a ball pen on an earlier occasion, too. The same way. Unwrapped. 

I told myself Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m never using Sonamâ€<sup>TM</sup>s pen for my theory exams. Sonam is bad luck. (Ever since she dumped me). 

I gave boxes of chocolates to GPRS. Then all of us went for an evening stroll in the paddy fields midway between campus and Shiv Mandir, a small township on the outskirts of Siliguri. 

â€<sup>~</sup>What are your New Year resolutions for 2007, birthday boy?â€<sup>TM</sup>, Renu asked me. 

â€<sup>~</sup>Nothing. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t believe in resolution-wesolution or even birthday-wirthday.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Liar. I had 3 aims â€" or resolutions â€" for last year, which though simple, couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be fulfilled. 

1. To learn to ride a bike. 2. To learn to swim. 3. To visit maternal grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s village in Arunachal. 

I was never interested in bikes and automobiles - that sort of stuff - so I never tried them. I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even differentiate between a Bullet and a Pulsar. All looked same to me. And swimming, the best Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve managed so far is to crawl underwater on both hands while legs and body float parallel to the water surface. This type of pseudo-swimming is possible only in knee-deep water. 

Khamuk village - where maternal grandma lived - used to be my favourite place in the world. Mother would take us there every winter. After grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s demise, our annual visits became infrequent. Now, seven years had gone by without me stepping a foot into that tiny, isolated hamlet surrounded by thickly wooded hills on one side and the noisy, gurgling Diyun Hka river on the other. 

Those days, there were only 2 families in the whole village â€" grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s family and her neighbours who lived on the other side of the dirt-road leading to the river bank. Other companions were the wild elephants who were shy and remained confined to the jungle on the nearby hill, occasionally trumpeting during evenings to make their presence felt, and foxes who gave grandma constant headache because they would often sneak into her chicken-house at night and run off with a chicken. 

The nearest town was Miao, which could be reached by a boat across the Diyun Hka, or a rope-way service â€" now defunct -- from Pisi village, a kilometre away from grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s house. There was a road to the town too, but that was the longest route. 

The hamlet got its name from the Khamuk river, a small tributary which branched off the Diyun Hka and ventured inland into the paddy fields. There was a natural, underground pool near the house. It was a creepy, dark place â€" dark even at day-time - with trees casting shadows from above. It had crystal clear water over a bed of small, flaky stones. When we spoke, our voices would bounce off the walls above the pool and echo into our ears. 

Every day at the village was spent plucking oranges and playing in the river. Initially, we tried plucking oranges by tugging them with a bamboo pole but most of them would rip apart and get destroyed when they landed from that height. Climbing the trees on a ladder and plucking with hand was the best option. 

Grandfather was a wrinkly, old man with a stringy frame. He looked a decade older than he was, maybe because he smoked too much opium. He spent his days weaving baskets out of bamboo splinters; not for sale, it was a hobby. He would prepare khaulam â€" sticky rice cooked in bamboo â€" for us, which we dipped in honey and ate. Before we went to the river, he would carve daggers out of cut bamboo and present us. He had a bow whose bamboo string was so taut, none of the children managed to pull it. 

He loved sitting around the fireplace and rarely walked out of the house because one of his feet had been amputated. Years ago, that foot got severely infected due to delayed treatment and had to be surgically excised in a Dibrugarh hospital. I loved staring at his bony, footless leg every morning as he sat on the veranda, soaking in the warm winter sun and leisurely changing the piece of torn shirt-cloth which covered his cut end. 

The only time he went out was to his small poppy garden to collect the sap from poppy pods whose outer parts bore numerous incisions for the latex to ooze out and solidify into sticky resin. This resin would be mixed with finely chopped infant banana leaves â€" when the leaves are curled around in a compact tube yet to unfurl â€" in a voluminous copper or brass spoon and heated. This ball of resin-soaked banana leaves would be dipped into an outlet of the opium pipe and smoked, while we mimicked the sound of water guggling inside the pipe as grandfather inhaled through the mouth-piece. 

Unlike grandfatherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sedate nature, grandma was the opposite â€" lively, talkative and full of life, even at her age. Unlike present Singpho women who wear their traditional skirts wrapped around parallel, she still followed the ancient way of wrapping it in an asymmetrical, irregular manner and also sported a turban made of white cotton. Everything about her attire was ancient. 

She loved to swim in the river, my grandma. She would wade into the water and swim effortlessly, hands underwater, legs beating the surface forcefully like a paddle -- two loud, rhythmic splashes at a time, dhap-dhaap, dhap-dhaap -- foamy splashes following her wherever she swam -- the buoyancy of water ballooning up her skirt wrapped around tightly round her chest. 

I had never seen a woman as old as her swim with a childâ€<sup>TM</sup>s delight, with full abandon. Only Ongsan, the neighbour boy, was a better swimmer than her. He would place a plump bamboo under his chest, swim through the strong current of Diyun Hka - the bamboo cutting through the current and partially neutralizing its strength â€" and reach the other side of the river. 

I tried to copy grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s style of swimming but the body only got submerged to the river-bed and I ended up swallowing lots of water through the nose. 

* The thing I dreaded the most in that village was to be teased with maternal cousins. Thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s no such thing as maternal sister in Singpho culture. All the maternal uncleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s daughters are marriage prospects. From the time uncleâ€<sup>TM</sup>s daughters were barely old enough to enter pre-school, they would be teased by village-folk with either me or my brothers, 

â€<sup>~</sup>There! There! There goes your old man!â€<sup>TM</sup> 

To which I would respond with an irritated, constipated look to the elders, displaying my disapproval. 

(No way Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m marrying anyone. And no, not this baby girl who carries a teddy bear piggy-back and feeds Amulspray powder to it.) 

Those childhood days, boys and girls were enemies. Boys hated girls because they were habitual mirror-viewers and effortless cry-babies. Girls just needed an excuse to cry. You outshout her, she would cry. Only tomboys were cool because they were like us, they played marbles with us, they shot catapults like us, they climbed trees to pluck guavas and berries just like us. 

* The year grandma passed away was a sad year. Monsoon rains were relentless. The Diyun Hka swelled into a giant of a river and due to water scarcity; people in Khamuk village had no other option but to drink its muddy water. 

On the way to the village, mother didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t speak a single word in the car. When she climbed up the ladder to grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s house and walked across the crowd of crying women sitting all around grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s lifeless body, she let out all her pent-up emotions and wailed with such sorrow and grief that it seemed her soul had been split in thousands of dying fires. 

Village people told me that grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s eyes were half-open till then and closed only after mother arrived in the house. 

Rituals for the dead were followed. Rice beer was brewed. A wild boar was hunted down and brought to the house by young men carrying it on their shoulders on a wooden rod which passed through the boarâ€<sup>TM</sup>s mouth and came out of its anus. Hot water was promptly poured over the animal and the hide smoothly scrapped with a sharp, flat bamboo stick. 

Grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s coffin was being prepared and decorated with paint and paper-cuts of vivid colours. The coffin would be burned on the day of cremation. As is the custom, people enjoyed the feast, got drunk, danced for the dead and engaged in merry-making. There were movie screenings too, a modern twist to ancient traditions. Priests performed rituals so that grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s soul would successfully go off to the land of the dead where she would live with her ancestors instead of remaining on earth, among the living and troubling her near and dear ones out of affection. 

Amidst all this merry-making, mother spent her days and nights crying and crying and crying. Her eyes were sunken, her face was lifeless and pale and she refused to have food for days. It was painful to look at her those days. 

One of those nights, I had a nightmare where I saw grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s headless body plodding through the gate of the house. It was a strange dream. Every time I blinked, I saw grandma walking through the gate again and again. Even though she was faceless, headless, I felt no fear. I knew she would do me no harm. 

On the night of death, people were disturbed by grandmaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s beloved cats making shrill, strange cries that pierced through everyoneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s ears. They were not meows, not the typical way cats cried when they complained of hunger; they let out an altogether peculiar sort of sound, something irrepressibly melancholic. People deduced it that the cats missed grandma and they wanted humans to understand even they were in grief. 

After grandma left, Khamuk village would never be the same again.
