*Season 2: Thalaivar v/s The Killer Toddlers* 

*Pravin Vemuri* 

*Episode 1:* *The Toddlers Attack!* 

Inspector Meriyappan has a Saki moment when, peering outside the window next to his desk, he enquires: "What are those round things coming towards us? Are those toddlers who are throwing them?" 

Of course, the round things are grenades. 

Of course, the toddlers are throwing them. 

Of course, those are his last words. 

Obviously, the commissioner puts in a call through to Thalaivar almost instantly. 

Voiceover: *Friends, wait! It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the Thalaivar entry yet. Because before we get to the great man, we need to go back one week to when this absolutely ghastly activity first started. * 

*And remember, this is based on a true story!* 

*Episode 2: The Toddlers Attack! Again!* 

One week earlier: A group of toddlers aged between 3 and 4 years, dressed completely in black with shades and red bandanas and armed with AK-47s, Uzis and grenades, break into the Shantiniketan playschool in Adyar. They tie up the teaching and the non-teaching staff and lock them up in the recreation room. They escape with five students. 

The parents and police express disbelief and amusement, respectively, at the staff‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s recounting. 

Fortunately, the close circuit cameras capture enough to deepen the disbelieving parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> alarm and to shock the amused constables into horror. 

The group targets two more schools in that week. The papers christen them: ‚ÄoeKiller Toddlers‚Äù 

Voiceover: *The world has seen child soldiers, but not this young. Never this young! * 

*Is this how it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to be? Is this because of internet? * 

*Doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t everything evil in today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s world have its genesis in a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>google- search‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>?* 

*Episode 3:  Thalaivar Entry!* 

Thalaivar is putting the final strokes on a gang of dacoits in Badaun U.P. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an urgent and necessary trip he has had to make. The gang receiving the supreme one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s attention is the famous ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Khooni Kaka Aur Saat Balatkari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. Thalaivar is bludgeoning them to pulp when he gets a call from the commissioner. He flips his e-cigarette to his lips and promises to call him back. 

Thalaivar executes his final judgement of the gang-members. ‚ÄoeCastration is the only solution!‚Äù he is heard saying. 

Thalaivar finishes up and flies off. The dacoit gang sits in a circle in the middle of a clearing wearing women‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s clothing and bangles. They are clapping with their palms held flat and chanting ‚ÄoeHai! Hai!‚Äù as the credits roll. 

Voiceover: *No part of this world is safe from deviant men. Thalaivar will go wherever required to rid the world of evil men. * 

*Just that he has started travelling to the wild and gruesome north part of India too often these days.* 

*Episode 4:  Thalaivar has scruples! * 

Thalaivar is torn up. He has met and told the commissioner that he needs time to think about fighting a group of toddlers. 

He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s now at his home, slowly sipping his Bagpiper whiskey with a splash of water and contemplating further action. The phone rings, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the commissioner. He asks Thalaivar to switch on the TV. The toddlers have attacked another police station. This time they have put it on fire. 

On the TV, the reporter is screaming frantically: ‚ÄoeWhy is Thalaivar not doing anything? What is he waiting for? How many more policemen have to die?‚Äù Thalaivar switches off the TV in disgust. 

Someone knocks on the door. 

Thalaivar opens to find a four year old girl shivering from the rain outside. 

*Episode 5: WTF!* 

The young girl tells Thalaivar that he is her father. Thalaivar is shocked but he is called away by yet another phone call from the commissioner. He asks the girl to stay put and watch TV while he heads out to meet the commissioner. 

The police commissioner is sitting at his desk, holding his head. He is groaning and sobbing loudly. There are many policemen around him, all with their heads bowed down. 

Thalaivar enters. ‚ÄoeWhat happened commissioner?‚Äù he says. ‚Äoe 

The local MLA, the WCW minister and all the parents are outside because we encountered one of those bloody toddlers‚Äù 

Thalaivar pats him on the back and hands a tissue. 

‚ÄoeThe whole media is out there baying for my blood. You have to help us Thalaivar!‚Äù the commissioner says. 

‚ÄoeI am not sure I can‚Äù says Thalaivar 

‚ÄoePlease! What I can do to convince you? I will mow your lawn. I will wash your clothes. I will potty train your dogs! Please, Thalaivar! I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let go of your legs until you agree.‚Äù 

He is on the floor wailing and holding Thalaivar‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s legs. 

His staff sniggers. Thalaivar shakes his head in pity. 

The commissioner gets up embarrassed. He wipes his face dry, straightens out his shirt and put his hair back in its place with his hands. 

‚ÄoeFine. I will go now and put up a brave face for the media‚Äù, he says. 

This gets everyone, including Thalaivar, laughing. But apparently the commissioner is serious so they eventually stop. 

‚ÄoeYou don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I can put on a brave face!‚Äù the commissioner asks of them. Everyone stays quiet. Except Thalaivar, everyone bows their heads. 

‚ÄoeWhat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so wrong with my face?‚Äù the commissioner demands of them. 

Thalaivar pulls the commissioner aside and says in a low voice, ‚ÄoeAm sorry my friend. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your face‚Äù 

The commissioner lets out a heavy sigh. ‚ÄoeI know you mean that but I really wish it were true. Hell, even my wife wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t agree with you.‚Äù the commissioner replies and leaves the room. 

*Episode 6: Family Trouble!* 

Thalaivar flies back home. He finds the young girl sleeping on the couch. He carries her to the bedroom and covers her up. 

The commissioner comes home and finds that his wife and daughter have resolved not to speak to him. They leave his dinner on the table and go to bed. They also leave behind a letter in which they call him a child killing monster. 

The commissioner drinks until he passes out on the dining table in a pool of tears.  He dreams that he has been kidnapped by the killer toddlers. He has been made to dress up in a very short blue frock with frills on its sides and his is dancing for them while they surround him in a circle egging him on. He wakes up in an alarm covered in sweat. 

Thalaivar wakes up from a bad dream too. He has dreamt of rescuing the commissioner from the toddlers but he hurts many of them in the process because he has to use a driller to make his way out. 

He walks over to the other bedroom where the little girl is sleeping. She is snoring loud enough to wake the dead. 

*Episode 7: Thalaivar Strikes!* 

The commissioner gets a rude shock when his wife refuses to serve him breakfast. His daughter has started to refer to him as ‚ÄoeGeorgy Baby-Killer‚Äù. He starts sobbing again in his car on the way to the police station. He feels slightly better when he is in his office but then all his phones start ringing and he is paralyzed from the fear of what they might inform him. 

Thalaivar dresses up in a kimono and goes into his meditation room, formerly called ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Zen space‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and before that as ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Fortress of solitude‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. The little girl makes and serves him green tea. 

Thalaivar closes his eyes and uses his super hearing skills to scan all police stations for voices of toddlers. He zeroes in but he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand what they are saying. They are talking in some sort of toddler-speak. 

So he tries his super telepathic skills to read their mind. But they think in toddler-speak as well. 

But, within minutes he gets up in a hurry as he has deduced where the toddlers are headed with the help of Google Maps on his IPhone. 

*Voiceover: Please note that Thalaivar doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t endorse either Google Maps or IPhone at this point.* 

*Episode 8: Thalaivar to the rescue!* 

Thalaivar changes into his normal clothes in seconds and flies out of the office. He reaches Nungumbakam police station just in time to save the cops from being blown up by another grenade attack by catching and lobbying the grenades into the Bay of Bengal. He doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t lay a hand on the toddlers and they escape in a couple of police jeeps. 

*Voiceover: Thalaivar was born with superpowers but he also gained many over time. For example his super hearing sense was gained by the two years he spent at the Kerala Ayurvedic facility in Thrissur where they poured hot scented oils in his ears. In the argument of nature v/s nurture, Thalaivar weighs in heavily on both ends. * 

*Episode 9: Back to School!* 

Thalaivar comes back home to find that the little girl has cooked him dinner. Chicken biryani with raita and poppadum along with a peg of Bagpiper whisky with just a splash of water, just as he likes it. The girl has fallen asleep on the table waiting for him. Thalaivar picks her up and takes her into the bedroom. He comes back into the living room to have his drink and smoke his e-cigarette. Sometime after midnight, the girl walks into the living room and wakes up a passed out Thalaivar. 

‚ÄoeI can teach you‚Äù, she says. 

‚ÄoeTeach me what?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHow to speak like the toddlers.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeGood‚Äù, says Thalaivar. 

‚ÄoeThere is one condition though‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat is it?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou have to keep your mind open‚Äù, the girl says, ‚ÄoeOnce you are down this rabbit-hole, you will need to have a lot of faith to believe you see and hear‚Äù 

Thalaivar and the girl dress in kimonos and go inside the meditation room. They sit down cross legged and girl starts to speak. 

*Episode 10: Scare Tactics!* 

The police commissioner is at his desk when he receives a text message to open the desk on his table. He opens to find a Barbie doll dressed in a very short blue frock with frills on it sides. He is so shocked that he almost falls out of his chair. He turns the doll around and there is a small card there. The commissioner opens it. It reads, ‚ÄoeYou are next, bitch!‚Äù This time the commissioner falls out of his chair with a yelp. He crawls under the table and starts dialing Thalaivar. 

But Thalaivar is on his way already. He is flying as fast as he can as the toddlers have surrounded the commissioner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office with AK-47s, grenades and rocket launchers. 

*Voiceover: What do you do when death is at your doorstep? You call the police right? And what if you are a cop and death is at the doorstep? * 

*Exactly! * 

*Because, remember, this is a true story. * 

*Episode 11: Thalaivar to the rescue!* 

Thalaivar uses his super mass hypnosis powers to put all the toddlers to sleep. He then flies them all inside the commissioner‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office. The commissioner has already passed out in the corner from fright. 

When the toddlers are conscious, Thalaivar sits them down and asks them to tell their story. Their leader, Erapalli Sreenivas or E. Sree (which is his street name) stands up to speak. Their story is one of great loss and sadness. It makes all the toddlers cry. E. Sree is able to control his emotions to some extent and relate his story; but he often breaks down too. 

Then all the toddlers relate their stories. They move Thalaivar to tears. 

Each of the toddlers was a victim of police brutality in his or her past life, often tortured to death by third degree. Thalaivar asks them to put their faith in him, that he would avenge all of them. 

Not by killing the policemen. But by righting the system. 

‚ÄoeNow I want you to sit down and still your minds‚Äù, Thalaivar says. 

The toddlers don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand but they do so anyway. 

‚ÄoeI am going to use my powers of hypnosis and a spell I learnt in the Himalayas to erase your past lives‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> memories‚Äù he says. 

The toddlers start grumbling their dissent. 

‚ÄoeChildren‚Äù, Thalaivar says, ‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. I am going to eradicate police torture from the great state of Tamil Nadu. That is my promise to you‚Äù 

The toddlers settle down on the floor and Thalaivar closes his eyes to meditate. 

*Voiceover: Interestingly, Himalayas is also where Thalaivar learnt the recipe for making excellent masala tea. If you have the great fortune to have one made by him, you will know what heaven tastes like!* 

*Episode 12: The final solution!* 

The commissioner is woken by Thalaivar. 

‚ÄoeWhat happened? Did I fall asleep?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes‚Äù, says Thalaivar, ‚ÄoeYou slept like you were hibernating, George‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t slept in many nights Thalaivar‚Äù, the commissioner says, ‚ÄoeI have been having these nightmares of- Wait! Where are those God forsaken cop killers?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhere they should be‚Äù, Thalaivar says, ‚ÄoeSound asleep at their homes‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThalaivar!‚Äù the commissioner has fallen at his feet again, ‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know how I can thank you enough for this‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHere is how. Assemble all your policemen in the Chidambaram stadium first thing tomorrow morning‚Äù, Thalaivar says, ‚ÄoeI want to address them‚Äù. 

He flips his shades on and leaves by the window. 

When he arrives home, he notices that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s empty. The little girl has gone. She has left him a glass of Bagpiper whisky with a splash of water and his e-cigarette beside it. Thalaivar smiles at the sight and sits in his favorite chair to savor them. 

*Episode 13: Final Solution#2!* 

Its 9AM in Chennai. The heat and humidity can drive most humans to insanity. But the Chennai cops are either impervious or immune or beyond help. They are standing in parallel lines, rigid and attentive. After all, the great Thalaivar has asked them to be present. He has asked them to be present exactly at 9AM. Most of the showed at up 5 in the inevitable and crazed anticipation. 

Punctual as he is, Thalaivar flies in at half past 9. He reaches the stage and refuses the mike. Using his super-voice, he addresses the crowd. 

‚ÄoePolicemen of Chennai, you know I have always respected you‚Äù he says. 

The crowd murmurs acknowledgement. One of them screams, ‚ÄoeOne more temple saar!‚Äù 

Thalaivar quiets them down. ‚ÄoeBut today I am very, very ashamed of you‚Äù 

There is dead silence in the ground. Then there are sounds of tongues clicking. The heads of the policemen are hung with shame. Some of them started spitting their disapproval of their colleagues. ‚ÄoeWe will stop taking bribes Thalaivar!‚Äù one of them screams. ‚ÄoeWe won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t grope maids and cooks Thalaivar! Never again!‚Äù another screams. ‚ÄoeWe will definitely not refuse people FIRs we are too lazy to prosecute, Thalaivar‚Äù the third shouts. ‚ÄoeWe will also not encounter those neighboring old men whose dogs bark late into the night and disturb our sleep. I am truly sorry about that personally, Thalaivar‚Äù, the fourth hollers. 

‚ÄoeNo, no! God, no!‚Äù Thalaivar says, ‚ÄoeActually, yes, stop doing all those things. But that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not what I am here for today.‚Äù 

The crowd shrugs collectively. They are looking at each other quizzically. ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s really getting hot here, and there is no drinking water, man!‚Äù someone shouts. 

‚ÄoeOk, ok‚Äù, Thalaivar says, ‚ÄoeI will not keep all of you in suspense. I am talking about police brutality during interrogation. That is a matter very close to my heart! And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also the reason why those toddlers were enraged. Today I want you to promise me that such a thing would never happen again. No more third degree, understand? If it happens I will personally see to it that you pay for it heavily!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWe promise!‚Äù the crowd replies without losing a beat. 

Thalaivar raises his hands. The crowd erupts in applause. 

Thalaivar flicks his finger. It starts raining. The crowd erupts in applause again. 

Thalaivar flips his shades on, his e-cig in and flies off. 

Probably to north India again.
