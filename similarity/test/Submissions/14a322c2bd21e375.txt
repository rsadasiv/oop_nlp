Bio: I am a lawyer working in Winnipeg, Canada. However, I grew up in India and feel deeply for it. During the summer of 2011, I was a law student and briefly interned with Justice Dalveer Bhandari at the Supreme Court of India. I was familiar with the progressiveness of Indian jurisprudence before I started the internship. However, I was surprised to see how empathetic the judiciary could be to the needs of the citizenry. Justice Bhandari's orders, with respect to urban night shelters, were illustrative. But, last December, Justice Singhvi's judgment in the *Naz Foundation *case astounded me. The court had essentially turned its back of freedom. Earlier this year, I struggled to put my despondency into words. However, about a month ago, I completed the story at the bottom of this email. I believe that it provides a glimpse how cruel and how invasive the effect of the judgment is. Please advise if you wish to publish it. I would appreciate publishing under the pseudonym "Afsana Mavi." 

The tale of the corpse 

You are dead. I am at your funeral. Your body lies still in the coffin as others come and go. Their tears fall with a rhythm too precise to be sincere. You stay silent as I lean in for a penultimate kiss. 

You were always fluent in silence. You spoke the silence of mischief, when you teased me before a kiss. You spoke the silence of frustration, when you were stuck in traffic. You also knew the silence of grief but usually tried to hide it beneath a smile. But you never shared your final despair with me, whether through silence or words. You died in utter loneliness: 

I see you knocking on the doors of the monastery. No one answers. The monks are on vacation. You feel out of breath in the thin air. Leh, which you once called home, now feels harsh and foreign. The trek from the Old Palace to the monastery, which had once felt like a trot, seemed exhausting to you. You look into the valley and it is unrecognizable. Yaks have made way for cars. Corrugated iron has replaced most of the old mud thatched roofs. The once barren land is now dotted with willows. But the valley still looks beautiful. You feel at peace as the sun sets behind the snow-capped peaks of the Zanskar. You leap off the edge of the cliff, spreading your arms to embrace the expectant ground.... 

The cashier at the tourist counter of the Old Palace swears that he saw you smile when you fell. He hoped that you would flap your arms and fly, but you never tried. When the paramedics arrived, they could find neither a pulse in your veins nor a breath in your lungs. No procedure, prescription, or prayer could save you. You were dead. 

I am at your funeral. Your feet lie still in the coffin. I can no longer coax them to dance. You stay still as I tie your shoe laces. 

You were never a good dancer. Ten years ago, you were tiptoeing forwards and backwards anxiously at a salsa class, trying to learn the basic step of the dance, when your glance met mine. What a tangled grip you had, when you tried to spin me. However, you loved to learn unfamiliar things. 

I see you on the flight from Delhi to Leh. You feel that Delhi, our home for ten years, has betrayed you. You seek the solace of first sensations in the         comfort of your first home, Leh: the colourful hue of its solitary mountains, the coolness of the waters of the Indus, the calm of its gompas... The   air-hostess appears and asks whether you want some butter-tea. You gladly say yes. But, your tongue has forgotten its taste. It is more bitter than you anticipate. 

I am at your funeral. Your waist lies still in the coffin. No stroke of mine can revive it. You stay still as I clasp your belt. Your uncles and aunts recite eulogies. Their words seem fictional; you had not met them in years. 

We had built our island together in Delhi. We spent our days at work and our evenings exploring the ruins scattered across the city. We often made love beside the grave of the slave king in Mehrauli. As I moved in you, now deeper now shallower, the graffiti of other lovers murmured encouragement. On the ancient walls around us, men proclaimed their love for each other. When we first went to the Old Fort together, you pointed out the building from which an emperor once fell and died while answering the *muezzin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s *call to prayer. As a kit of pigeons flew by, we speculated on the details of the love letters that we assumed they carried. 

I see you crying at home after your talk with the principal. You go to the balcony, hoping for some consolation from the soft blue sky but find only smog. Your sweat drips on the concrete floor. You wipe your brow with your sleeve and find it lined with soot. A murder of crows gleefully cries ‚ÄoeCaw Caw Caw‚Äù from the roof of          the building, as if it has just feasted on the carrion of our hopes. 

I am at your funeral. Your face lies expressionless in the coffin. It reacts to none of my fears and sorrows. You utter no words to console me. 

You used to talk wonderfully. Your words could make the faithful doubt the existence of God or make skeptics believe in it. If you described it, even a dolphin with dragon breath would seem real. Your students, even the average ones, listened to most of your words although a few inevitably passed through the sieve of adolescent inattention. 

I see you preparing for your class. You are reciting Hamlet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ominous soliloquy -    ‚Äoeto be, or not to be...,‚Äù when the principal intrudes and inquires ‚Äoemay I have a word?‚Äù You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t resist. You pull out your dictionary and state, ‚Äoeyes, of course! Which one do you want?‚Äù The principal is not amused and delivers a notice of termination. It specifies no cause. As he leaves the room, the principal adds - ‚ÄoeI just heard the verdict of the Supreme Court. Your life is a crime. You can no longer teach here.‚Äù You have lost the words to respond. 

You are dead. I am at your funeral. I sob like an infant. Tears drown my face. I lean in for a final kiss. Your brother interrupts me and pleads, ‚ÄoeNo, please don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t! Your love is not legal.‚Äù
