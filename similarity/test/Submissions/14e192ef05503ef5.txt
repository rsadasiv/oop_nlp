SHIVA‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>S WINDS 

( this story is based on actual events) 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>What? Going north? So early?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>  Ramji the owner of the inn asked Barka Bahadur even before the party of five - six including the baby ‚Ä" had settled down. 

Saili held her seven-month son, Purke, closer to her body, wrapping the worn grey shawl tightly  around herself, as if to keep at bay the mood of discontent that had settled over her ever since her husband, Sethe, had toyed with the idea of seeking work in Keylong. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We are early only by a week or two,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> lied Barka Bahadur. 

Saili had been distrustful of Barka Bahadur right from the time he had tried to persuade her husband, along with Sethe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s young nephews, Hari Prasad and Kancha, to make the trip in April. Her husband had been without a job for two months now; there was no work in the Kulu Valley, where they lived. Their savings had run out, and the baby, growing so fast, had added to their worries. Saili had argued that it would be wiser to go north later, about a month hence, when company and laughter during the large scale annual migration of labor eased the rigors of the climb. But idleness had made Sethe irritable and an easy prey to Barka Bahadur's persuasive talk about early arrivals earning higher wages. 

Ramji did not wish to argue.  ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I will bring you tea‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> he said, and made a diplomatic exit. 

Wood smoke from the fireplace filled the room with pleasant warmth. Saili moved to a corner and began to suckle the baby. She undid her head cloth - an involuntary act of relaxation - revealing heavily oiled hair plastered to the head. She said a silent prayer. ‚Äoe*Moi-lai par dahro*. See us through.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Hari Prasad, the taller of the two boys, laid his meager bundle of belongings against the wall. Kancha, the other boy, did the same. They sat on the floor, yawned, massaging their calf-muscles, which ached from the climb. 

And what a climb it had been! The road, cut across the sides of the winding hills, stood out like a dull blue ribbon in the surrounding grayness. The drop from the road to the Beas River below was perpendicular, vertiginous. The fierce, tumbling river appeared a dully gleaming strip from this height - soundless. Ramji‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inn at Marhi, provided a welcome break. 

Saili could not help thinking how foolhardy the two youngsters were, lured as they were by Barka Bahadur's promise of quick money and a few sly adventures with the hill women - "the higher hill women" as Saili liked to think of them - since she too was a hill woman. ‚ÄoeThese women‚Äù was the jealous reason why Saili had decided to come along, in case Sethe was tempted into something foolish! But in her heart of hearts she knew that they needed two incomes. 

Ramji brought the sweet hot tea and joined them. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>When will you leave?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Ramji asked 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Tomorrow. We will start early and cross the Rothang Pass by afternoon,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Barka Bahadur said. He was darker than the others, his longish un-oiled hair hung untidily over his forehead like a curtain over his small eyes. His teeth were yellow and his hard muscular hands were the most noticeable feature of his otherwise stringy structure. 

Ramji clicked his tongue and shook his head. The whole plan was foolish. This 

was April. The mountains were still covered with snow and the fierce winds that 

swept down their sides made climbing difficult and camping impossible. Usually, the 

movement of men and goods did not start before the middle of May. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>This is the time for the strong winds. And there are frequent snow storms,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Ramji said. 

Darkness fell early. Cold draughts blew through the cracks in the walls of 

Ramji's wooden shack. The fireplace was ablaze. There was quiet.  Saili absently 

suckled her child, her eyes half closed. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I worry about you, Purke,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she whispered to her son. 

Saili had started talking to her son from the day that he was born. Now, at seven months, he was her closest, rather only, confidant. She told him everything she thought about or felt. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Do you really think it is dangerous to cross the Pass?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> asked Sethe. He was taller 

than the others, thin but muscular. His narrow mouth was set slightly askew; this 

gave him an unintentionally sardonic look even when, as now, he was troubled. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You are always afraid,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>  Barka Bahadur cut in quickly. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have a child to think of,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Sethe  said sharply. 

Saili blinked her eyes, suddenly interested in the conversation. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Now when 

others tell him about the dangers of the journey he listens,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she whispered in Purke‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ear. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You have seen how he never gives ear to what I say.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Ramji said, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>It is dangerous. The laborers usually go up in May.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

The Lahaul Valley, which stand over thirteen thousand feet above sea level is ringed by the Himalayas on the northwest. It suffers from an acute shortage of labor, and Gurkhali workers are employed to clear the snow from the fields to grow barley and a  few vegetables. Little else grows here. The Gurkhalis, migrants from Nepal, come from the plains and the green Kulu Valley below, where they work during the rest of the year. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I have been to Keylong before.  The Rothang Pass holds no terrors for me,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Barka Bahadur said. 

At about eight that night Ramji had more guests. They were two Lahaulis, inhabitants of the Lahual Valley, returning home. They too intended to cross the Rothang Pass the next day. Saili felt a little relieved at hearing this. Here were two persons who lived in these parts; their experience would prove helpful. The Lahaulis shook their heads when they learnt why this group was here. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You have come too early,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> one of them said. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>So have you,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> snapped Barka Bahadur. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We know the Pass well. We have no luggage. We will walk fast. You will have 

to move slowly because of the woman and the child. You might have to face the night 

winds of Rothang,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> explained one of the Lahaulis with forced patience. 

Sethe was disturbed. Was it wise to proceed? Or should they turn back? He felt the pinch of the cold through his skin-tight *surwal* and his jacket, the *daorah*; he was the only one wearing the traditional Gurkhali dress. But there was nothing waiting for him back in the Kulu Valley; he might as well take his chances. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>No need to worry. We will start early and reach by the afternoon,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> said Hari Prasad with the brashness of youth 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Look, I even bought a pair of new shoes at Manali,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> added Kancha.  ‚Ä<sup>~</sup> To show off before the women  of the hills. I have heard that there are very few young men up there.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>They will not bother with you. You have wasted your money on that pair of 

shoes,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>  said one of the Lahaulis testily, affronted at the suggestion of easy virtue among the Lahauli women. 

After the evening meal they sat huddled on the clearing in the center of the room, 

smoking their wooden pipes. It was pitch-dark outside and one could barely discern the inclines of the hills that fanned out for miles in all directions. 

Ramji was known for his habit of entertaining his guests with interesting stories. He wondered whether he should tell them about how proud he felt, five years  ago, on the morning of 16th December 1971 in Dhaka to be precise, when as the orderly of Lt Gen Jagjit Singh Aurora, he knew that his *jarnail sahib* was going to accept the surrender of the Pakistani *jarnail sahib*. However, he decided that today the story of the Rothang Pass would be more appropriate. It was a story he had polished with every retelling to hordes of visitors for the last five seasons. He puffed at his *biri* and began. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Long ago there was a great mountain barrier across the land. The Lahaulis lived to the north of this barrier. They were poor people and they longed to see the other side because the winds told them of a world where one could buy and sell many beautiful things.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

He paused for effect, an expert on local legends. 

' ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We must find a way', the Lahaulis said and decided to ask Lord Shiva.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Saili folded her hands in mute obeisance at the mention of Shiva‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s  name. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>So the Lahaulis pleased Shiva with many offerings.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Ramji stopped, then with a change of inflexion continued: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Shiva agreed to cut a path with his whip. He warned them though that the winds that his whip would raise would be strong and fierce and they would sweep down the Pass for a  good part of the  year. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>On the day of the great deed, Shiva warned the people to stay indoors and hide. The first to seek safety were the people of the south.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Ramji paused, made sure that no indigenous inhabitant of the Kulu Valley was present, and said in a whisper, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Because they are, er, a bit cowardly.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

The group was too engrossed in his story to be amused by this comment. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>It was late in the evening when Lord Shiva smote the mountains again and again with his whip. Strong winds rose, and a storm raged, and rocks cascaded down. As clouds crashed against each other, and thunder and lightning broke, the sound was deafening.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

A reverent silence prevailed and the expression on the faces of Hari Prasad and  Kancha reflected awe and fascination. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The earth was dark and silent for some time. When light reappeared the people  saw the valley which had been cut through the hills.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Ramji paused, as though waiting for applause. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>And this we know today as the Rothang Pass.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Disheartened by the reverential instead of the usual amused response to his story, Ramji decided that he had regaled the company enough. He went into the inner room.  The guests spread their sheets and slept on the floor. Saili slept fitfully. Every time she woke, she ran a hand over Purke to make sure he was there. Sethe spent a troubled night too. Had he been too hasty, he asked himself. 

Someone had told Saili that they should carry prayer flags before they set out on the last lap, the most dangerous part of the journey, and, next morning, as the pale sunlight  bled  down the mountains showing up the brushwood around the shack, Saili whispered to Sethe to get the prayer flags.  Barka Bahadur laughed at the suggestion. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>You fear too much.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Purke, ask Barka-*daiee* didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t he just hear of Lord Shiva's power? Doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t he have the humility to respect such might?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

The Rothang Pass was three steep miles from Ramji's shack. The two Lahaulis set out early, walked at a brisk pace and were soon out of sight. 

Sethe trudged besides Saili, both a few steps behind Barka Bahadur. Hari Prasad and Kancha walked ahead. The sun spread its wings and the warmth of its touch tingled through Saili‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s body. They walked at a steady pace, but it was uphill all the way, and rough, and Saili stopped frequently to regain breath. They were tired and hot well before noon. They sat down to eat the frugal meal that Ramji had packed for them. They were not even   half way up to the Pass at this point. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>We must walk fast.  Darkness falls quickly,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> said Barka Bahadur. He readjusted his brown shawl of coarse cotton. Under the shawl he wore a tight shirt against which his hard muscular body chaffed. His broad, bronzed face with its bold lines suggested strength, just as his legs under his discarded army shorts with their bulging calves spoke of years of hard work in the hills. He was fond of Sethe  and they had been in and out of jobs together. Idleness was anathema to both of them and Barka Bahadur's promise of work beyond the Rothang Pass had been made, he assured himself, with good intentions. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>It will start getting colder sooner than you want it to,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> said Barka Bahadur. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Look at that mountain. You cannot see its top because of the snow. Come, walk faster.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Barka Bahadur recalled how during May and June one could not get space to walk. The Pass was crowded with people from all over: Tibetan nomads, Ladakhis, traders from Kulu going north with matches, sugar and tobacco. The largest in number were the laborers. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>And there are Americans and other white people too. They come to climb the snow slopes just for fun. It is good they come. They spread money around.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Yes, I have seen them do that,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> agreed Sethe. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>And then there are the shepherds with hundreds of sheep.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Why do they take the sheep so high?‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> asked Kancha. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>They take them to the mountains for summer grazing. Once, many years ago, I moved with a shepherd. It was slow going. But I learnt a lot. One must take shelter under various boulders when a fierce wind blows. Or when it rains. And definitely, when it begins to snow. The boulders break the force of wind, rain and snow.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

Saili suddenly became aware of the majestic mountains looming ahead. The snow had melted near the top and at various places on the sides creating a weird mosaic of dazzling white and bluish-grey. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Look, Purke, look,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she said to the child, sharing her feelings of wonder. 

Below, the rock on which they walked was grey and very dirty in contrast to the whiteness of the snow above. Suddenly, another startling contrast struck Saili. Everything around, everything in the shadow of the mountain, was yellow and brown, much duller than the brilliant green and bright opalescent blues they had left behind in the Valley. Even the sky overhead was a depressing grey. 

It was getting cold and little quivering breezes swept softly down the hills. The 

track became rougher. It was soggy and getting a foothold was difficult. Saili stretched her* chaddar* over the faded tartan blanket that Purke was wrapped in. 

A hundred yards ahead, at the foot of the Pass, Saili saw Hari Prasad and Kancha. They had reached the snow-covered slope and were having fun by sliding down it. They waved to Barka Bahadur to join them. 

How beautiful the Pass is, thought Saili. It opened like a huge serrated V before her : a kaleidoscope of hanging glaciers, mini snowfields, and exposed rock. 

The colors of the day turned greyer as the clouds gathered. The soft breeze had become a disturbing cold wind. As Saili, Sethe and Barka Bahadur set foot on the Pass, the woman clutched the child to her breast and whispered a prayer to the mighty Lord Shiva.‚Äoe See us through *Shiv-bhagwan*.‚Äù 

Her awe was mingled with fear every time her foot met the freezing stream of snow. Was this the very path which Lord Shiva himself had cut? 

The masses of clouds began to darken rapidly and descend on the mountains till Saili  felt that she could almost touch the sky. She was tired and hungry. She wanted to rest and suckle the baby for a few minutes. Why had she brought Purke along, she asked herself. But with whom could she have left him?  Should she have come along at all? She realized that her presence was slowing down Sethe and Barka Bahadur. 

It seemed that the winds Ramji had predicted were rising. Barka Bahadur was uncertain, but he gave no inkling of the real danger behind the huge, menacing clouds that loomed overhead and the winds that were now blowing hard and cold. A little speed, a little more determination and they would reach the crest. Barka Bahadur hoped they could reach it before the storm broke 

It was long past noon and in the darkening gloom they could not see the way too well. Saili looked up and suddenly  had the impression that the sky had lowered itself further; it had swallowed a portion of the snow-covered sides of rock. The clouds were black and menacing and the echoes of the winds as they rushed past her were frighteningly loud. 

Saili was breathing hard, but every time Sethe offered to carry the child, she refused, clutching it to her breast. She knew the rough tartan blanket alone could not keep Purke warm. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m happy you never complain, little one, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>she told Purke. 

Hari Prasad and Kancha were way ahead. Sethe and Barka Bahadur walked slowly a few yards in front of Saili. 

All of a sudden the wind rose, driving snowflakes before it. Each step now required more effort and often Sethe and Barka Bahadur paused to take a few deep breaths.  Saili stopped for longer intervals, tired and helpless. Why was she subjecting little Purke to this *agni-pariksha?* she asked herself. The wind, biting, ferocious, blurred her vision, and her only guide was the outline of Sethe's figure etched by the fluffs of snow which settled on his jacket and as suddenly flew away on a fresh gust of wind. 

The drift of snowflakes became thick as a curtain. They lashed at her, trying to push her back. She could see Sethe and Barka Bahadur as blurs through the haze. Often she stumbled, but she held Purke close. Once she imagined that Sethe turned round to say something to her but the furious wind tore away his words and all she saw was the clouded pantomime of his wild gesturing and waving. She was deafened by the noise of the wind and her eyes watered with the sting of driven snow. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>*Shiv bhagwan, Shiv bhagwan*,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> she muttered. 

The wind changed its direction slightly, the curtain of snow became thicker, and all was whiteness. 

Saili had the sensation of being carried on the wind and being deposited close to a snow-covered face of rock. A few yards away was an overhanging boulder of rock.  A fragment of memory: Barka Bahadur had said that boulders broke the force of the wind. With an effort, like a last spasm of life, she crawled under it. She stretched out her arm and the solidity of the rock gave her confidence. Numb with the cold, her body stiff, she struggled to hug the baby closer. She went down on her haunches, placed the baby on her lap, turned her back to the raging storm, and bent her body like a tent over Purke. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Live, my son, live. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll never be able to live if anything happens to you.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

The two Lahaulis who had started early reached Khoksar around two o'clock.  In the *rasta-bhai-bandhi* spirit of trekkers, they kept a look out for Sethe and his party. There was no sign of them even by nightfall. 

Early the next morning the two Lahaulis went to the market place and talked to a group of porters who made daily runs between Khoksar and Marhi or Beas Kund, carrying goods on their backs. They told the porters to look out for Sethe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s group. 

Two hundred yards from the top of the Pass this group came across a new shoe, half embedded in the snow. A few yards ahead, the edge of a brown shawl jutted out of the ground. Further ahead stood an overhanging boulder like a huge awning strung out with dainty stalactites. Under the awning they saw the bent-double figure of a woman. They brushed the cracking curtain of stalactites aside and called: ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Sister. Sister.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> 

When they received no answer, one of the porters touched her body. The body tilted to one side amid a slight crackling of snow. The woman was not frozen, but her limbs were stiff.  Her eyes were glazed. Cradled in her arms was a bundle in a faded tartan blanket. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s move on,‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> said one of the laborers. They clicked their tongues in sympathy and began to move out of the shelter of the boulder. 

Almost as a second thought, another said, ‚ÄoeLet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take another look anyway. Who knows *Shiv Bhagwan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s* *leela*?‚Äù 

They gently released the bundle from the tight mothering arms. 

There was a moan.  This prompted them to hurriedly dust the sprinkling of snow off the tartan blanket. They clustered round the bundle. 

Another moan. A slight movement of the head. 

The baby was alive.
