Bio: I am Vishnu, 23 and from Kerala, India. I currently work for the ad industry as a copywriter, in Bangalore. Bizarre fact - I was born in Uzbekistan, and none of the people I've told this to have ever been able to point the place out on a map. I dream of many things but also of finding ultimate happiness and purpose in writing, and also of writing a great novel which will be everything I am, and consequently my gift to the world. I am a 5 year old, hopskopping inside a bigman suit. 

Sunday, 11th December 

I rose with the Sun today. Later we had lunch together and caught a movie after that. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not my favourite film, and I pointed out the irony that it's called 'breaking dawn'. But I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think he got it. When I suggested we should go to the park instead, he refused, saying that he does not like it when he is out in public since everybody would keep looking at him. "But only for a moment!" I said cheerily. "And after all," I said, â€oeitâ€<sup>TM</sup>s me who should be feeling uncomfortable, because here I am going out with someone billions of years older than me." 

The best part about today is that a day like this has never happened, nor could I have ever imagined it to happen. What with the long, confusing, chaotic day Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d had yesterday, I just wanted to get a good night's sleep, not even wanting to think of the next. So I switched off both my alarms (the one on my watch and the one on my mobile phone) and climbed into bed with sleep hanging over me like a raincloud about to burst.

Before I knew I was awake I became aware that my feet were extremely cold. As I pulled them under the covers, I wondered why that had happened. Then I felt the AC blow over my legs - I was lying opposite to the direction I usually sleep. I sensed a warm glow on my face. I opened my eyes, and there he was beaming down at me. 

At that moment, it seemed to me as if all the oceans of time and space he had waded over was to see me this morning. That I had been waiting my whole life for just this moment, without ever really knowing it. And even then he just stayed there, casting his light upon my face, waiting for me to wake up. "Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m in love," I said to myself. In the heat of things, I think I blushed a little. 

Attempting to cover up, I said my first words to him. "I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t usually let anyone inside my room, but I have made an exception for you."

In the back of my head, I keep wondering how this day is going to end. And in all sincerity of my being, I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want it to. I cannot bear the thought of having to wait through the darkness of another night. The cold and calculating night, whose measureless depths have deceived many a man. 

After the movie, we somehow thought the same thoughts and made it to the beach. Everybody did look at us, but only for a moment. I was shining beside him, genuinely enjoying all the attention. As we walked I held his hand, and I thought I felt him blush too. When we reached the waves we sat down, and I lay my head on his shoulder, trying to dissolve forever into him, to be blanketed by his warmth forever. I do not remember how long we sat like that. The crash of the waves began to get louder, and the wind was getting cooler. I felt him beginning to wane. I raised my head to look up at him. 

He joked he could set in the east just for today. â€oeIâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll make an exception for you," he said. I watched him receding into the far horizon. I took comfort in knowing that I will be seeing him again tomorrow, and I will pretend to be asleep when he comes up against my window. The waves crashed behind me, and I watched him disappear behind the silhouettes of all the things he gave life to.
