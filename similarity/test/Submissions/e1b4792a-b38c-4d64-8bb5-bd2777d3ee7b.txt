Born and raised in Mumbai, Dr. Ravi Dhawan was an investigative journalist and a known humanitarian. In his demeanour, Dr. Dhawan was less handsome than imposing. He was tall and his beard, large and blunt, gave his face a regal aspect. He spoke loudly, declaring his opinions with a candour that might be called hubristic (if one was skeptical) or bold (if one wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t). In their first meeting, Dr. Dhawan impressed Kareena with his words. His enthusiasms did not pertain wholly to the criminal sphere but extended to even philosophy.

‚ÄoeLove is all about companionship. It isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a destination but a journey. A journey where you can share your darkest and deepest secrets with that one person under the blue sky. Love isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about a couple being perfect. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about them being together through thick and thin in spite of the fact that they are not perfect.‚Äù

Time froze for Kareena. This man was absolutely right. Love means spending time together, not running away. She never thought she would ever like a journalist but there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a first time for everything. She smiled knowing very well that Dr. Dhawan was just like her. Not everyone could understand her and similarly not everyone understood him.

They got to talking and one thing led to another, ultimately culminating in their marriage.

*****

The big day had arrived. The pinnacle of all his years of hard work. As they reached their destination, he gripped his wife‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand, willing her to come closer to him. She had seemed different lately. Distant, almost. He comforted himself, saying it would all end today.

The room they entered was already full of journalists, photographers, TV reporters and other hangers-on. He sat nervously as his publisher introduced him, but as he took the mic, confidence rose once again. No one listening to him would realize that his palms were sweaty.

And why wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they be? It was the launch of his first book, the result of five years of mind boggling effort. The treatise was a defense of the current laws on rape. ‚ÄoeThe Mind of a Rapist‚Äù explained why marital rape, was not, technically, rape.

Taking inspiration from ancient history, the law today condemned marital rape only as non-criminal domestic violence. In view of rising feminist calls to criminalize marital rape, this book was exactly the shield the government needed.

‚ÄoeMarriage gives conjugal rights to a spouse and it cannot be revoked except by divorce. Logically, it follows that a spouse cannot legally revoke a right to sexual intercourse. And where there is consent, there is no rape.‚Äù As he finished reading, he looked up at his wife in the front row, who stared back at him stony-faced. More than once he wondered what had gone wrong between them.

Dr. Dhawan didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have much time to mull over his personal life, for the Q&A session had begun.

‚ÄoeSir, during an interview with The Hindu last week, you mentioned about different types of rapists. Please give a brief elaboration.‚Äù A spectacled journalist asked the first question of the evening.

‚ÄoeRape is not just about sex. Rapists can be categorized into five types. First, the Power Assertive rapist claims to have a weapon but uses it to ensure the victim's cooperation. Second, the Anger Retaliation rapist carries hate towards women and punishes victims by injuring them to the point where they require hospitalization. Third, the Power Reassurance or Opportunist rapist takes advantage of an opportunity to commit a rape and is normally done in conjunction with another crime such as burglary, robbery or kidnapping. Fourth, the Anger Excitement rapist is the most dangerous type as this perpetrator wants his victim to be killed. Fifth, the Juvenile Offenders have problems with authority such as school, police, etc. and they seek to take their anger out by punishing the victims. And let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not forget, the perpetrators can be women as well, who lure unsuspecting victims into traps to be raped by others.‚Äù

The Q&A session went on for another thirty minutes, followed by a photo session.

As they left the conference together, his thoughts drifted back to that fateful day where this story had begun.

*****

*Three years ago, as part of his research, he had gone to interview a rapist in prison. The words spoken by a young lad of twenty three still burned in his mind.*

*‚ÄoeWho do you think you are, to act so high-and-mighty around us? You think you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re perfect? Insanity is perfection. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what you are missing. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll never appreciate the thrill, the high after a good old fuck. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll never understand us, for you are not one of us.‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeDo you ever regret it?‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeHell no!‚Äù*

*The words of the rapist echoed in his mind the entire day. That was the first night he raped his wife. *

*****

*Ravi remembered the scene as though it was yesterday. Kareena had fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for him to come home. He let himself in, quietly, lest he wake her up. Her fair face had never looked lovelier. A small smile played on her lips, beckoning him forward. The young rapist‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words played in his head, over and over again.*

*Seized by a lust he could not explain, he grabbed hold of her shoulders. As she jerked awake, he pulled his wife to their bedroom.*

*‚ÄoeWhy, darling, I was just waiting for you!‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeWhat happened?‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeLeave me, I can walk for myself!‚Äù*

*Her words were lost amid the muffled sounds of her resistance.*

*Not once did he release the pressure on her wrists.*

*As they reached the bedroom, he tore her clothes off. Her protests didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even register with him anymore. He had to have her. Immediately.*

*Ravi left Kareena for a moment, to take off his own clothes. She walked determinedly towards the door.*

*‚ÄoeOh no you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t! Not until I get what I want!‚Äù He had pulled her back, and threw her over the bed. *

*His hands restraining her, he had forced himself in. As he pushed into her, her screams had almost a surreal quality around him. Post orgasm he realized that she had gone limp beneath him, the pillow muffling her cries. It was almost as though she had given up.*

*The minute he let go, she had walked away. *

*The next day, apologies followed. ‚ÄoeI didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what I was doing, my love. Will you please forgive me?‚Äù *

*Kareena believed Ravi and forgave him. Little did she know this was just the start of a long ordeal.*

*****

*As the car jerked over the rough road, he came out of his reverie. ‚ÄoeDamn,‚Äù he thought, ‚ÄoeI really must have more control over myself.‚Äù The mere memory of that night had made him horny. His mind was filled with the exciting possibilities waiting for him at home.*

*Kareena stared straight ahead, unaware of his fixated glance. He placed his arm over her shoulder. An involuntary shudder ran through her body.*

*She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hide her hatred for him anymore. Blinded by lust and power, he had somehow managed to ignore it. She dreaded the moment they would reach home, for she could not even imagine what further horrors he had in store. *

*Kareena had never understood the reason he raped her. After the first time, she had thought it must have been her mistake that she had somehow failed in her wifely duties. But the next morning, he had seemed so apologetic, so sincere. He had even sent a bouquet of red hibiscus, her favorite flower, to her office. ‚ÄoeIsn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t Dr. Dhawan the most romantic husband?‚Äù ‚ÄoeI wish my husband were more like him!‚Äù Her co-workers had oohed and aahed at the gorgeous roses. And in her heart, she wished to forgive him.*

*But that night, as he crawled into bed next to her, she was too terrified to sleep. She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bear to let him touch her. And so, the days passed by. *

*Two months later, Dr. Dhawan had come home in a drunken frenzy. She had locked herself in the bathroom to keep out of his way. However, he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t to be kept out by a mere door. ‚ÄoeYou are my wife, and I will do with you as I please. Now get out of there before things get any worse‚Äù, he roared. He had broken the door and dragged her into bed.*

*The perfect life that she had always dreamed of living had turned into her worst nightmare. It was the first thought that came to her as she woke up. He was gone. And, soon, this bedroom, the house in whose eastern corner it sat, and the tiny garden outside with its gnarled old red hibiscus and the half-grown mango tree they had planted together, all those would be gone as well. It was the strangest feeling ever. She never slept again while he was in the house. *

*****

*The third time he raped her, Kareena could take it no longer. Seething with anger and humiliation, she marched down to the local police station. But the officer on duty seemed more interested in his cutting chai, instead of sympathizing with her. *

*‚ÄoeMadamji, it is not a criminal offense. How many times should I tell you? File a complaint of domestic violence if you want.‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeWill that get me a restraining order against him?‚Äù*

*‚ÄoeArre madam, he is your husband. Let him do what he wants. Why do you want to create trouble?‚Äù*

*In spite of everything that had happened so far, his callousness managed to shock her.*

*****

At long last, they reached home. Kareena was trembling before he had unlocked the front door. The minute it opened, she walked towards the kitchen. Ravi stood at the door, torn between lust and love. Lust won, and he started towards the kitchen.

A steak knife in hand, she waited. As he entered the kitchen, she stabbed him in the throat. Kept stabbing every inch of him she could reach till he stopped breathing.

When the police handcuffed Kareena, she said, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not the criminal here. It was self-defense. He raped me for three years.‚Äù
