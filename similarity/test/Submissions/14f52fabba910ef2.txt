*A Melting Sun* 

*She is* 

The digital bedside clock showed 4 am. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>It darkest before the dawn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> kept buzzing in her head. She shook her head slowly from side to side. Arunima had to keep these thoughts away. 

*She was* 

‚ÄoeKi re, ki korchish?‚Äù Arkda had ambled into her room. ‚ÄoeKichu na, ei boi porchi‚Äù Arunima replied. She tried to hide her excitement to see Arkada. Blood gushed to her face, sweat forming on her nose tip. She put down ‚ÄoeWhere Eagles Dare‚Äù and kept watching Arka, who was now sifting through her books on the study table. After about five minutes Arka declared despondently ‚ÄoeNothing fascinating‚Äù, and then his bluish grey eyes fell on the book on her lap. ‚ÄoeThere it is‚Äù, and with that he leapt at her. She managed to scurry away to the far side of the bed, but he caught her by her left foot. Her body quivered and she felt faint. But she feigned anger and kicked hard. He plopped down on the floor beside the bed gripping his chin. She rushed back to him, only to have him embrace her tightly. She was crushed into his hairy chest, the pungent sweaty taste filling her entire being. 

He was still holding her. All these 13 years. Her nostrils were insensitive to any smell for it was still searching for that sweaty smell in a stuffy room with cheap furniture, light years away

The horrors of everyday life had bothered her for many years. The daily grind of getting up, showing up, making out and feeling guilty afterwards was an endless loop. Like a song stuck out of time. It was all part of the plan. The only problem was it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t her plan. As for her, she did not have a plan and of course nobody believed her. It had been evident to her about a decade ago, that there are 2 kinds of people, ones with plans and without. The former turn out to be sheep dogs while the latter, the sheep. Not that she wanted to lead. But she did not want to be led either. People told her she was sitting on the fence, little knowing that to her nothing existed, neither the fence nor the animal farm

‚ÄoeCan you pass me the jug of water?‚Äù, Ma was back from the market. Beads of heavy sweat had formed on her forehead, and she was out of breath. Her yellow sari hung over her body like an old rug thrown over a used coat hanger. Only her eyes belied her. They were detached and far away. Nothing could touch ma. But she had let him touch her daughter. That had been selfish

‚ÄoeCome in dear, I have been waiting for you for an hour now‚Äù, Raghuvir Kaku was a regular at their place. Even though it had been a year since her baba passed away, he hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stopped his visits. She had come to forward to their lazy afternoon chit chats over coffee. Discussing college or a recent film or reading Shakti Bhattacharya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s poetry, until recently. 

His transgression had initially been subtle, or maybe she had portrayed herself to be available. Or maybe he just wanted to hide in her like she wanted to; in Arkada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chest. 

She avoided answering him and flitted around the room like a shadow, wanting him to disappear. Or if only she could be like Alice and grow smaller or larger. Will that scare him more or her? 

He was standing behind her now, hissing sweet nothings in her ears. Her ears were burning, she felt charred. She whirled around to push him. Right then Ma entered the room. 

When Arunima looked up, both Kaku and Ma were gone. She knew right then, that she now had a place in the farm. The choice, which she had avoided for so long, had got made for her 

*She will be* 

Arunima sat at her desk, very still. Staring unblinkingly at the dirty green wall, she realized the city was finally quiet. The Universe was now at a delicate balance, poised and ready for what she was about to do. And she half hoped that someone would disturb the balance and quietude, but none did. 

She started the ritual which she had repeated so many times in her head. Her eyes started sweeping across the furniture. Her bed by the windows, on which she lay awake eight hours a day; for the last ten years. The old calendar on the wall with Swami Vivekananda‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s picture, annoyingly inspiring. On the wall opposite the window, stood her clothes rack and a small dresser. The dresser was perennially in a mess, with white grains of talcum powder forming a permanent layer on it. Beside the dresser was the door behind which hung her housecoat, a straw hat and scarf. The scarf was her grandma‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, bought from Kashmir. 

She peered closely at her most favourite furniture, her book shelf. She tried to read some random titles to see if any book had the power to pull her back. They didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. 

Flicking on her laptop she logged into the social networking site. Arkada had posted a new profile photo of him and his family, settled in Seattle. It hung in her mind like a postcard, of unknown people in unknown places. Scrolling down; she found a photo of APJ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s funeral procession. Rubbing her eyes she peered closely. He seemed to have his lips twitched into a half smile. ‚ÄoeIf you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun‚Äù his quote was written below the photo. 

How does one shine while they are burning? Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they just melt like she had been melting from those decade old afternoons, a bit every day? And now she had no more to melt, or so she had thought. Or did the sun not melt? Then why does it burn? ‚ÄoeTo shine‚Äù somebody whispered in her ears. She froze.

‚ÄoeArunima, check your results online, wake up!‚Äù ma was banging on the door, a sound so distant. She somehow pulled herself back from her time capsule. Sunlight was streaming in through the windows. Clicking the favourite‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s link on her laptop, she entered her user name and password. 

-X- 

The telephone did not stop ringing till late evening. Even Arkada called up from the postcard. She might have crossed over, to the other side. The gates have opened. 

And in her dustbin, lay a bottle full of sleeping pills, untouched
