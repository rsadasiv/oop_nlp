Bio: I am a published writer of both completely made up stories as well as the gritty and often uncomfortable truth of real life. Most of my fiction is inspired by my work as a journalist and as a writer for the international humanitarian charity, the Red Cross. The fact that my stories are flavoured by real-life encounters from around the globe enables me to talk about them in an engaging **and credible way and with passion**. * 


*No Coincidence * 

*By Carla J. Dow* 

The beast‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s teeth glow white in the moonlight, sharp fangs accentuated by its dark quivering lips. A deep growl rumbles up from its belly. The animal hovers over the carcass of the Mouse Deer, protecting its feast. 

Juwita does not need telling twice. She backs away from the tiger, her hands held up in surrender, palms open as if to show the creature she has nothing to hide. Slowly, slowly she slides her feet back, fighting the urge to turn on her heel and run for her life. But she knows that would be a mistake, she must not show it her back. But how far away does she need to go before she can do what every nerve and fibre of her body is telling her to ‚Ä" and run? 

She reaches the tree line and only then does the animal dip its head to sniff at its meal, no longer interested in her. Fear drops from Juwita‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s throat to her gut like a stone in water. She turns her back and runs. She tears through the forest, each step an echo of her relief. Her elation builds as she puts more and more distance between her and the beast and she comes closer and closer to safety. The tiger could so easily have taken her life. But he chose not to. This time. She thinks herself truly blessed - surely it was no coincidence that she should meet the Lord of the Jungle tonight. It was undoubtedly a warning. 

Green waxy leaves slap across Juwita‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bare arms as she runs, scalding her for being so reckless as to venture this far. Her illicit desire to be with* that man* could have cost her not only her reputation now, but also her life. Her cheeks colour at the shame. It is a warning indeed, she sees this now. She owes the tiger a debt; she owes him her life. It would have been too easy for the beast to slit open her throat with those sharp teeth, to spill her breath onto the mossy forest floor, to separate her heart from her chest in a pool of red. But instead, all he took was a debt. 

As Juwita crosses the perimeter of the village with these final thoughts she realizes that she cannot report the sighting, for that would be a betrayal of the debt. They would hunt the tiger down and kill him. And it would also betray herself ‚Ä" she would have to reveal her reason for visiting the river so late at night; to be with *that man*. Both the man and the beast are forbidden. So, as Juwita climbs into bed, she tucks her secrets in beside her and holds them close. She will tell no one. 

-- 

It is the scream that wakes her, although her mind does not register it. The first thing to cross her thoughts is how late she must have slept for the light of the morning to be so well advanced. Her second thought is of irritation and only then does she become conscious of the awful noise and sleepily wonders what bad thing could have happened to prompt it. 

Juwita leaves the shadows of her hut and emerges into the bright clearing squinting her eyes at the gathering crowd. Painful sobs and angry cries pierce any remnants of her sleep. 

Minah is on her knees beneath the Durian tree, her hands covered in a dark sticky substance. Her eyes are wild circles of grief. The woman writhes back on her heels and slaps herself across the face leaving smears of red on shiny tearstained cheeks. Her mouth spews out a confusing jumble of words. But Juwita hears all she needs to in the few snatched words. A tiger has snatched Minah‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s baby boy. It is not long before the men march out to hunt.

Sally finishes typing and sends her status update into the world wide web. She pockets the phone and sits back to listen as her fellow volunteer addresses the small crowd of locals gathered in the longhouse. 

‚ÄoeThe Malayan tiger is listed as endangered under the IUCN Red List and is totally protected under Malaysia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Wildlife Conservation Act 2010, in which offenders can be fined up to RM500,000 and incur a mandatory jail sentence,‚Äù Scott announces. A murmuring of unrest rises amongst the villagers but Scott ignores them and continues. ‚ÄoeThe tiger is an endangered animal. There are thought to be only about 500 individuals remaining, but in reality that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s likely to be a lot less.‚Äù 

Scott pauses to let the facts sink in. But Sally knows these stats and catchphrases will have little effect on the people here, this is not the way to do things. 

Sure enough a man stands, his fists clenched at his sides. ‚ÄoeYou do not need to tell us our own laws,‚Äù he says. His English is good, his voice strong. ‚ÄoeWe love the tiger, it is our national animal. The Lord of the Jungle ‚Ä" of *our *jungle. But what can we do when the beast comes into our village, kills our livestock, steals our children ‚Ä" are we to let it slaughter our families? Do we allow our babies to be taken? No! It is not possible.‚Äù 

Another man stands, ‚ÄoeWe have lived side by side with the tiger for hundreds of years. They stick to their space, we to ours. But if the animals come into our territory, of course we must protect ourselves.‚Äù 

His words are supported and echoed back at him from across the wide room. Scott turns to Sally, his eyes wide begging for help. She sighs and steps up. 

‚ÄoeCurrently, 90 per cent of Malaysia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tiger habitats are contained within four states that still have a substantial amount of forest cover: Pahang, Perak, Kelantan and Terengganu. But the tigers are being driven from their homes by the logging ‚Ä" they stray into the villages because their own homes are being destroyed. That is where we need to begin ‚Ä" we can work together to solve this.‚Äù 

The murmuring of discontent settles into a few tuts and the shaking of heads. 

‚ÄoeWhat can you do?‚Äù the local man who spoke up first asks her. 

‚ÄoeWe can help you to set up response teams distributed across the village areas bordering the forest. We have done this in other places successfully. Each team would be made up of volunteers who we can train to scare tigers back into the forest - safely.‚Äù 

Silence descends over the longhouse. Sally knows from experience that this is a good thing, although Scott, who is newer to the charity, shifts on his feet uncomfortably. She gives him a sharp nudge. 

‚ÄoeHuh? Oh yes, um, we also can provide lesson plans for your schools, design educational activities together with your community, to build awareness and support for the tiger teams for future generations.‚Äù 

Sally allows the smile to creep across her face as a few heads begin to nod.

Yunos heaves the wide tree trunk into place and takes a step back to wipe the sweat from his neck with his already soaked t-shirt. The smell of freshly cut wood rises from the damp forest floor in the midday heat. 

A shout from the foreman spurs him back to work - he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even take a few moments breather with these guys. 

Men scuttle around the site like worker ants, each with their own task in an army of laborers. With all that manpower it is not long before the wood has been loaded onto the trucks and they have roared away, engines pumping black smoke out of high chimneys that stretch from the cabin roofs. 

Through the dark smog of the machines, Yunos gazes upon the scar that they have ripped into the earth. The forest has changed beyond recognition. Beyond repair. Where only this morning green branches swayed is now open empty space. Where until just hours ago thick roots had hugged the earth is now a churned mass of brown mud. And he was part of this. 

The green that motivates him is slapped into his palm. Ringgits. Money. The wages he needs to feed his family. Yunos turns from the wound in the earth and faces the long walk back to his village. He must make it home early tonight, he has promised to help a new team of volunteers keep watch at the edges of the settlement, looking for signs of tigers and scaring away the beasts before they encroach on their livestock, or worse, their children. He is tired, exhausted from his long day of hard physical and emotionally draining labour - but he must protect his family. ENDS
