*Guest House* 


For many years since my boyhood, I had an irresistible desire to visit Ooty which is the summer capital for all south Indians.  There was a reason for nurturing this desire.  In those days it was known not only as a tourist place but also a haven for film producers and directors who used flock here to shoot a number of thrilling duet songs.  So I developed a fascination for this beautiful hill station. 

I had tried several times to visit this paradise on the earth during my college days and thereafter, but much to my chagrin it had always remained a far reaching dream.  Since my attempts had not yielded any results, I abandoned all my pursuits.  ‚ÄoeWhen it happens let it happen.‚Äù  I told myself and comforted myself.  But, nevertheless, I waited for the day to fulfill my desire. 

The day had come after thirty years.  It was in 2000 I was picked up for H.D.Thoreau Fellowship by the Director of Dhvanyaloka at Mysore, and I was invited to stay in Thoreau Cabin which he had built on its two acre campus in the north-east corner. During my stay, I was expected to lead a life of H.D.Thoreau and maintain journals and writings and submit them at the time of leaving.  It was a great honour I felt bestowed on me.  Though there were many senior writers I could not understand why the Director of the Centre had chosen me for the Fellowship.  It was something incredible to me. However, I accepted the offer in all humility. 

This Fellowship came as a blessing in disguise since I thought I could make use of my stay and visit Ooty.  I was told on enquiry that was just a four hour drive from Mysore.  This was a wonderful opportunity for me to materialize my dream.  Also I realized there was no problem for my stay at Ooty as the Director of the Tribal Research Centre located at M.Paladu, 12 kilometers away from Ooty Railway Station had been known to me for a long time as he happened to be a Telugu speaking person.  At one seminar I made friendship with him and we became good friends as the months and years rolled on.  Also I realized that my dream was coming to a reality since this friend of mine had on several occasions invited me to visit Ooty and be his guest; and he promised that he would make arrangements during my stay.  I recounted all this and it was a thrill for me to visit Ooty.  The right moment had arrived I realized.  So, with a sense of assurance, I dialed his telephone number which he had given me and asked me to be in regular touch with him.  I spoke to him and told him that I had been in Mysore on a Fellowship and expressed my sincere desire to visit Ooty.  To my surprise he had agreed to my visit and accordingly he said he would arrange accommodation in the Guest House attached to the Tribal Research Centre.  He also directed me as to how to reach M.Paladu from Ooty Railway Station.  This was a great shot in the arm and soon, I thought, my long standing desire was going to be fulfilled. 

On the last day of my Fellowship I packed my luggage and boarded a matador van for Ooty.  It was morning and the month was June.  The south-west monsoon had already set and I was told Ooty was experiencing rain.  It would be a pleasant day for me to stay, I thought. 

For a few kilometers the van had taken the plain road leading to the Western Ghats.  As it reached the foot of the hills, the road had taken its swift turns and twists and the journey was rather exhilarating.  Passing through the Ghats, the van slowly climbed up the hills through the serpentine roads with either sides covered with tea gardens and valleys.  As the van climbed up and up, the temperature started dipping down and the chillness persisted.  After a four hour journey in the lap of serene nature, we reached Ooty in the afternoon around one. 

Getting off at the bus station, I had a small meal in a restaurant and boarded a mini bus that took me to M.Paladu in 45 minutes as there were many stops.  The Centre was located on a hillock that was down from the road where I got off from the bus.  Dragging my wheeled suitcase I walked up the steep serpentine road and reached the Centre‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s main building.  It was already five and by then the staff had already left for their home.  There was a sentry standing outside at the entrance and he stopped me on seeing me and made enquiries.  He had already been instructed by the Director to receive me and accommodate me in the Guest House.  As I introduced myself the sentry with a muffler around his head and neck took me to the Guest House and showed me the room on the ground floor where I was expected to stay for a week.  It was in the corner at the end near the staircase that led to the first floor.  It was a single storied building in semicircular shape.  There was none in the Guest House and the couple who had come there for honeymoon after spending hardly a night left.  I was the only occupant, I was told. 

The sentry gave me a couple of instructions as to how to open the main entrance door and close it and lock it from inside at night and in case of emergency I could call him and use torch which he had given me.  It was half past five, the sun had already slid behind the rising mountains and the shadow of mountains had fallen on this little hamlet and it looked as though the night was advancing.  I had my bath in hot water and refreshed myself.  The Guest House was situated on a raised hillock surrounded by valley on all four sides, and a little down from it was the Centre‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s main building.  So it provided me a pleasant view and the landscape around it was captivating.  I went round the Guest House to get myself acquainted with its surroundings; upon its roof I stood and looked around.  It was exhilarating for me since I was a lover of nature.  All around I could see huge leaping trees, terraced fields wrapped in fleeting clouds and the luxuriant lush green flanks of the hills.  I thought I was blessed to have been there and my dream became a reality. 

As I was tired, I slept pleasantly covering body with two thick woolen blankets provided to me by the sentry.  Although I shut windows and the floor, I felt chillness inside the room.  Nevertheless I managed to sleep and the first night went off with no disturbances and problems. 

Morning arrived and the sun rose gently from behind the cone-shaped hills and the rays stretched as far and swaddled the land turning it into bright yellow goblet.  After finishing my morning chores I came out from the Guest House and headed towards Ooty to have my breakfast and visit a couple of places. 

Back to the Guest House in the evening after visiting Ooty Lake and the famous Botanical Gardens.  As I was about to enter the Guest House, I saw the sentry moving around the office building. 

‚ÄoeWhere did you go the whole day?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI have been to the town, and I have visited the Lake and the Gardens.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeIs this your first visit to this place?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes, this is my first visit.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHow was your sleep last night?‚Äù 

‚ÄoePleasant, very pleasant‚Äù 

‚ÄoeDidn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you experience any strange sounds?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat do you mean?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI mean in the middle of last night one married couple, both of them IAS probationers ran out form the Guest House shouting in terror.‚Äù 

I developed cold shiver in my spine.  Nevertheless the curiosity in me drove me to probe further.  ‚ÄoeWhy did they run for life?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThey told me they had experienced strange and unusual sounds after midnight.  They are married and they have come here for honeymoon.  They came running to me in utter fear stricken.  They slept with me and the following morning they packed their luggage and left.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAm I the only occupant?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes, there are none.  Hence I asked you whether you had slept well or not the previous night.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes, I slept well.  When I woke up, it was morning.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeDidn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you experience any exotic sounds?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNone.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAll right.  Tonight you be careful.  Here is the torch and a long stick.  You can keep it with you to face any unusual encountering.  Lock the door of the Guest House from inside.  Never open it if there is someone knocking.‚Äù  Having said these precautionary words, he went inside and I went up to the Guest House.  There was no one inside, I was the only occupant.  It was already six and I had my bath in hot water.  As instructed by the sentry, I closed the main door of the Guest House and locked it from inside.  I kept one long stick and torch with me in my room. 

It was eight, and I had some bread and bananas for my supper.  Lying on the cot I began reading a couple of books which I brought with me from Mysore, and my eyelids slowly dropped.  I realized that I should sleep.  Before I slept I ensured bolting the door from inside my room and the windows.  I was reminded of the sentry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s cautious words and I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sleep fully.  Every now and then I opened my eyes looked at the walls and closed my eyes.  Though I was having my deep sleep I was half-awake.  I waited for the strange and unusual sounds. 

It was one in the wee hours.  The exotic sounds that resembled moaning and howling started drifting through the narrow gaps of the shut windows by which side my cot was placed and it I was lying and sleeping.  The sounds woke me up and with my ears placed near the windows I began hearing the sounds.  I was not sure what these sounds were at the beginning.  I stayed in my cot for about fifteen minutes with my eyes wide opened and wondering what these sounds could be.  Though the sounds resembled as if human, they were indeed not.  Something unusual the sounds sounded and never before I had heard them so.  As I was reflecting on various conjectures an idea struck my mind at that hour ‚Ä" Why I should not open the main door and go to the windows outside and ascertain the nature.  After a while I withdrew from this idea fearing danger.  I could not even call the sentry who must have been in deep sleep at that hour. His room was fifty meters away from the Guest House.  Further I was not sure where he would be sleeping.  On the other I could not allow myself to sleep as these sounds worried me deeply. 

As I was reflecting in various ways I regained my energy, courage and confidence and decided to go out on my own and guarantee myself of the nature of the sounds.  With the redoubled courage, I got up from the bed, wrapped my body with a woolen blanket as it was chill outside, collected the long stick and torch and slowly and cautiously opened the door of my room and came out.  The building was empty as every room was locked.  Making cat walks, I went near the main door of the Guest House, unlocked it and gently opened it.  With partially opened door, I peeped out to ensure there was none.  It was pitched darkness beyond the tube lamp posts leading to the office building.  Holding torch in my left hand and stick in my right hand, opening the door a little wider to fit my body to pass through, I came out.  No one was seen at that hour, except the air was filled with an assortment of anonymous nocturnal insects.  Focusing the torch round, I went round the room and reached the windows of my room.  I looked around, nothing was noticed.  However the breeze in the valley was strong and hooting.  I sat for about ten minutes on the window sill with the torch in my left hand turning round, now and then beating the stick against the ground. 

As nothing was noticed, I got up and made my way towards the main door, opened it, slid inside and locked it from inside.  I went to my room in high spirit and bolted it from inside.  Once again I sat near the window and listened to the crooning sounding.  This time I was pretty sure and convinced that the exotic sounds were created by the hooting wind from the valley that got increased and gained different sounds when it passed through the thing gaps of the shut windows.  Slowly my eyelids fell and I slipped into sound sleep with no further disturbance. 

Morning came.  I woke up at six with the increased birds‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> calls as I had a disturbed sleep.  After finishing my morning chores, I came out and the sentry crossed me. 

‚ÄoeHow was your night sleep?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI slept well.‚Äù  I narrated him what had happened the previous night.  He was aghast as my experience was different from that of the couple who could not stay and left abruptly.  My friend the Dirtector of the Centre too returned from his official tour, to whom I narrated my experience.  He too was transfixed.  I stayed in the Guest House for the rest of five days and night all alone.
