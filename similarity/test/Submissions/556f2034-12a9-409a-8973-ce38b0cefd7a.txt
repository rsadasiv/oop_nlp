Enough have been said about the punishment for raping, 

Those who speak out in favour of patriarchal era are still aping, 

The mindset where male is the only vital person, 

Female and daughter are looked down and importance is given to only son, 

We need to differ from this obsolete view and treatment, 

The punishment must be severe for those who stand against the public sentiment, 

I believe the only thing to maintain harmony is to teach our son being decent, 

Take the route less travelled; tide away all the regular thinking by dissent! 

Those who are involved in rape, molestation should be incarcerated, 

If proven guilty they should languish in jail once they are castrated! 

We need to reform the rules, turn around the table and that too quickly, 

Because a girl, irrespective of any corner she is in, should feel safely!! 

Letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s make a point in being different to current rules and regulation, 

Strive hard to deliver justice and fulfil the victimâ€<sup>TM</sup>s expectation!!! 

Letâ€<sup>TM</sup>s join hand together and educate our son to be a man of pride, 

Remember, a mother had endured lot of pain while delivering child when she cried!!!!
