Devaki can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop her tears. It rolled down her cheeks nonstop. She wanted one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s shoulder to console and a hand to wipe her tears. Unfortunately no one was there to share her sorrow. She cries because of the shock she had on seeing her daughter Shanthi in sanyasin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s robe and fully shaved head that morning in this Ashram. Till she reached the ashram she was sad about her daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision which she knew since last month. Till this morning she expected some miracle that could change her daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind. She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bear the sight of her daughter in sanyasin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s robe.

She asked herslf..... Where I committed mistake? Why everyone moves away from my life only thinking of themself?  She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sleep due to the whirlpool of so many questions pondering her head regarding her past. Self pity engulfed her by thinking that those who got her help never thought that they too have the responsibility to reciprocate it. What did I get from this marriage, nothing but suffering. These many years I am working like a donkey.

 After marriage she moved from her native town Mayavaram to Thirupur where her husband  was working  in a spinning factory. He was an easy going guy and selfish. Even after their two children were born there was no change in his attitude.  This forced him to borrow money. But repaying the debt was not easy.He became highly irritable. To minimize his burden she too joined in a garment company as an assistant. To repay the debt, she  and her children cut short many of their requiremnts and slowly she tried to repay one by  one. She had to work throughout the day both at home and in the factory. Like a spinning top while she was working her husband became as cool as  before, To keep her under his control he used to pick up quarrels unnecessarily and  beat her too.

One day he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t return home from work. Waiting for the whole sleepless night she became panic. For the next one week they waited  for him imagining all negative incidents. When there was no bad news about him they started their routine work for their survival.  Why did he ran away from home?  She was clueless. But when the money lenders approached her again she understood the reason for his leaving the house stealthily. For the first time she felt the pain when betrayed by someone. Like a coward he put all the burden on her.  Why did he borrow so much money? Did he elope with any girl? She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even ask help from both parental  and in-laws side as they also were Struggling to meet both ends.

Then she decided to face the reality. For her two children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s upbringing she had to work more. Already she became a tailor in that unit by learning tailoring. There was a Home for destitute children nearby.  She went there in search of a suitable job. Luckily there was a vacancy for cleaning the Home in the morning and helping the cook in the evening. She was allowed to stay in a small servant quarters inside its compound. This enabled her to continue to work in the garment factory in the afternoon. They got food there.  Her children played with the children in the shelter in the evening. She could repay all debts in a couple of years and even started saving for her children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s future.  Her only happiness was her children‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s academic excellence. They were studying in a Government school and they were getting the help of the  volunteers coming to the ashram to teach the inmates.

 She was very strict and vigilant on her children to avoid the mistake committed by her in checking her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s activities. She remained Simple and insisted the same to her children. Her son Saravanan thought that she was miserly and hated his stay in the shelter. He longed for a better life. His stay in hostel while doing his post graduation intensified this feeling. He envied his roommate‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lavish lifestyle. Then and there he decided that if he get a good job he has to escape his mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s interference in his life. He hated her strict orders and vigilance. So when he got an offer from a reputed international company in campus selection he carefully planed and execute. Devaki was very happy that her sufferings were over. Devaki advised him as how to take care of himself in all aspects.

 He listened it as her last boring lecture to him and left Thirupur deserting his mother and  sister. When there was no communication from him in her distress Devaki tried all means to locate him. Finally when she contacted him over the phone she felt that he was reluctant to  talk to her, afterall she was his other. When she managed to meet him in the office and try to make him to understand his mistake, he interupted abruptly by saying that he would return wnatever she spent on him soon . His words shattered all her hopes and a blow to her inner strength. He meant only the expenditure! What about the love and care behind it? Shanthi consoled her and shared her grief. He sent money till he shifted to some other company and stopped all his contacts with them. She felt that she became weak day by day. Seeing her plight, both the company and Home reduced her workload by giving  her simple and dignified jobs. They did so considering her sincerity, hard work and long association with them. It took years for her to come out of the shock.

Meanwhlie Shanthi completed her schooling and joined in her degree course in a local college taking philosophy, socialogy and social science. Now Devaki had only one wish that Shanthi should get married in a good family and settle in life happily. As part of her studies shanthi had to visit shelter for destitue children and women, prisons and juvenile homes. One such institution which runs a home for destitute women, minor girls, a girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s school from K.G. to junior college and a Teacher‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s college for women impressed her a lot. Apart from  that they were helping the villagers in many ways. They give training for village ladies in different fields,helped them in forming women self ‚Ä"help groups and arrange meetings with bank officials to get loans for the same. It was run by selfless sanyasins of a particular faith, near Thirupur. She even participated in helping the villagers near Thiupur at the time of deluge with the sanyasins. It was a great experience to put so much effort to collect basic necessary items and distributing them among flood affected people. She visited that ashram during holidays and did voluntary service there even after joining Bachelor of Education course. She used to take her mother there to show how safe and secure is that place for homeless old ladies and minor girls .Devaki also  saw such volunteers in the shelter. So she never stopped her from visiting there.

When Shanthi joined the ashram school, she told her to join there after getting married to a local person with a good family background. But Shanthi joined that school as a trained graduate teacher. In a month or so she got a call from the chief sanyasin of the ashram and was told Shanthi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s desire to become a sanyasin and requested her to change her decision if she can. They needed her consent

When they were left alone she asked Shanthi, ‚Äoe Why is this sudden decision?‚Äù ‚ÄoeAmma, it is not sudden. Since our stay in the shelter I was impressed a lot by the selfless service of the chairman and volunteers. So this desire started long back and deep rooted in me whenever you praised them and I pitied the children there.‚Äù

 ‚ÄoeI have no objection  if you get married and work as a volunteer here with your family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s permission.‚Äù ‚ÄoePermission‚Ä¶..very difficult. You know that some volunteers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> services came to an end by family problems‚Äù. ‚ÄoeThen be a volunteer, why do you want to be a sanyasin?‚Äù ‚ÄùAmma, today I am going to tell something which I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t revealed to you when it happened because I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want  to give you tension. When I was in college one stalker followed me daily to college. First I ignored him, then with patience and then with strong words I explained him that I was not interested in marriage. He felt insulted and came with acid to throw on me. Narrow  escape, Luckily he was caught and handed over to police. This type of problems may be there if I work as a  volunteer. So instead of being a simple volunteer I opted for sanyas. My sanyasinhood will be respected and avoid  ill feelings in others.After that incident  I wonder, when my father left you, you were very young and how did you escape such incidents?‚Äù

Devaki was taken aback by this revelation and now she doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hide anything from her daughter as she is matured enough to understand everything. ‚ÄoeYes, I too had such troubles and my feelings as a young lady tempted me to take wrong decisions but both of you saved me from that. I literally killed all my desires and with a stiff and grim face I avoided the rogues. But what is the use? Your brother deserted me like this‚Äù. She started crying.‚Äù Now You too leave me to suffer alone.‚Äù

‚ÄoeOn seeing your grim face we too were afraid of talking to you. That may be the reason for Saravanan to avoid you. If I get married also you will live alone.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBut I will have the satisfaction that you are happy with your family.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWhat is the guarantee for a happy married life?  You know that most of the married ladies suffer and you too had the same. When You visited here last time You met many ladies who were driven away from home by their own children. If I suffer like them will you be happy? So I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to take risk by marrying someone. If I should not leave you I must be unmarried. Will it be fine for you?  The best solution for all these sufferings is to take up Deeksha here.

 We born here without bringing anything with us and we are going to leave without taking anything with us. You too have seen that you left your parents, siblings and friends when you got married. Your husband and son too left in the middle. You are so sorry about my decision as I am your daughter. If I were not your daughter you may even praise me. Think leisurely. It will clear your doubts.‚Äù Saying this Shanthi left. Devaki was spellbound by the clear and strong views of Shanthi.  When her husband left her she cursed him whenever she faced difficulties. But she never cursed her son even though he deserted her just like her husband. Yes, umbilical chord relationship is thicker than others. So she started thinking that let him be happy wherever he lives. Now she is clear that Shanthi understood the life and people better than her. She cannot join here as a destitute as advised by the manager,  because she cannot stand her own daughter moving with her as a stranger. She may cry whenever Shanthi is around making her uncomfortable.

When Saravanan cheated her she consoled herself thinking of those  suffering like  her. But in Shanthi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s case her choice is totally different from others.

Shanthi gave satisfactory reply to all her questions. But Devaki had no answer to Shanthi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s questions.  Shanthi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s decision of serving others is truly better than working for the beloved ones and lead the remaining life in distress. Then why is she crying? She is her mother! She felt that those who choose a different path for their life may be celebrated, but the pain they left with their parents especially with mother will remain forever.
