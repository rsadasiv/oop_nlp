We celebrate my husbandâ€<sup>TM</sup>s retirement by going to Arijit Singhâ€<sup>TM</sup>s music concert in Phoenix City. Our son booked the tickets and the limo online. Madan comes home early after his send-off party and we drive together to Whitefield. I wear a pink crepe silk sari with a gold border. Madan is dressed in his formal office attire, not in a kurta as I wouldâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve liked.

â€<sup>~</sup>New talent,â€<sup>TM</sup> Madan says, beaming and nodding his head to Arijitâ€<sup>TM</sup>s sensuous vocal rendition, clearly enjoying the show.

â€<sup>~</sup>Beginning of a new life,â€<sup>TM</sup> he claims, on the way back.

I smile, happy for my husbandâ€<sup>TM</sup>s retirement and our sonâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gift of celebration.

My morning-walk gang dissolves abruptly. My timings have changed, not theirs.

A new beginning, indeed! The TV comes on at five in the morning, followed by the bathroom light, the loud flush and the noisy brushing. At five-thirty, the Yoga mat laid out, Madan follows the Yoga instructor on the channel meticulously in the converted bedroom. I stir, wishing he would stay in bed longer. Whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the need to wake up so early?

My sleep flies out of the window at the opening loud sound of Aum. â€<sup>~</sup>Today we will do a hundred and one kapaalbhaatis, twelve anulom-viloms, and twenty-four surya namaskars,â€<sup>TM</sup> the TV instructor announces.

I pull myself out of bed, shuffle to the kitchen to start the filter coffee then go back to pull on my sweatpants and shirt. If I hurry Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll still get three quarters of an hour. Just in time to get the idlis on the steamer and the chutney ready for our breakfast after I return.

I see a woman in the park as I walk. Sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s seated on a bench with a newspaper, and a poodle on her lap. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t notice the white ball at first until it barks when I pass by. I jump, alarmed. â€<sup>~</sup>Sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s harmless,â€<sup>TM</sup> the woman says, â€<sup>~</sup>and Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m Devika.â€<sup>TM</sup>

I give her a weak smile. â€<sup>~</sup>Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m Indu.â€<sup>TM</sup> I carry on. I take a wider curve to avoid the poodle, holding my breath on my next round. Devika smiles. The poodle doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t move. I breathe out.

They are at the same spot every morning. The poodle seems harmless. I warm up to their sight. â€<sup>~</sup>Whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s her name,â€<sup>TM</sup> I ask, stopping by, knowing Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll have to cut short one round to make up for the lost time.

â€<sup>~</sup>Melanie,â€<sup>TM</sup> Devika says, putting down her Hindu.

Devika turns out to be single and the ex-editor of a womenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s magazine.

Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve done my Masters in Literature, but never held a job, I tell her.

â€<sup>~</sup>Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s too bad,â€<sup>TM</sup> she says, in a matter-of-fact manner.

When Madan worked for the LIC, he had to leave by 9.30 for which he woke up by 7.30. I crave those times.

â€<sup>~</sup>We have to go to the Dentist tomorrow,â€<sup>TM</sup> he says, at breakfast.

Why include me by default? I wish I could stay and have the house to myself instead. I try to wriggle out of it, but he insists. â€<sup>~</sup>Come on, what are you busy with anyway?â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Nothing.â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Then why not come along?â€<sup>TM</sup>

I miss my walk that morning to finish cooking so that lunch is ready when we return. I idle in the waiting room while he gets his root canal. Sitting there, staring at the walls and twiddling my thumbs, I wish Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d carried a book along.

Devika and I become early morning regulars at the park. One day I let slip to Devika how my life has changed since Madan retired.

â€<sup>~</sup>You put up with this crap every morning?â€<sup>TM</sup> she asks me, surprised.

It sounds strange when she puts it that way. Although I do miss my peaceful mornings and the house all to myself when he used to be at work, I do think heâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll settle down and relax his retirement routine eventually. â€<sup>~</sup>It takes getting used to this new life, I guess. Besides, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m grateful itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not all that bad,â€<sup>TM</sup> I tell her, laughing it off.

â€<sup>~</sup>If a man does what he wants to, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s because he can, but if a woman wants some peace, she is ungrateful?â€<sup>TM</sup> Devika says, with air-quotes at the end of her sentence. â€<sup>~</sup>Does that make any sense?â€<sup>TM</sup>

I wish Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d never brought it up.

I know my life has changed too. I step out of the house only with Madan now, or to buy vegetables from the vendor across the street. It strikes me I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t gone out with my friends in a while.

I seem to be busier at home now than before. But these are no earth-shattering changes.

I shrug Devikaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s words off.

But as I walk back home, I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t help thinking of the time Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d told Madan about the new sarees my friends bought on one of their shopping trips without me. â€<sup>~</sup>You donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have to get everything your friends get,â€<sup>TM</sup> heâ€<sup>TM</sup>d said.

Whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the big deal? I tell myself. I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t care too much for sarees anyway.

On Sunday evenings Madanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s buddies come over for a game of cards. Another new routine, except this works in my favour. I prepare the filter coffee and snacks for them and slip away, happy to meet Devika in the park. A couple of hours bent over the cryptic crossword, we keep up our women talk on the side.

My house help quits a few months later. â€<sup>~</sup>Saab interferes too much. Heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s always following me around, checking behind the sofas and under the beds,â€<sup>TM</sup> she says, as if thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a valid reason to quit.

Thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s only two of us, I reckon, while I look around for someone else. I mention it to Madan when the newest crop of maids demand the sky.

â€<sup>~</sup>I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t earn that kind of money,â€<sup>TM</sup> Madan says.

No, youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re retired now.

I let it slide.

I make do, keeping a part time in the evening.

â€<sup>~</sup>Arenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t I clever? She comes in when Madanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s out for his evening walk,â€<sup>TM</sup> I tell Devika, gloating over my ingenuity, as weâ€<sup>TM</sup>re huddled over the Hindu Crossword on a Sunday evening.

Devika continues to peer at the crossword. She lifts her pen, bringing it to her mouth. â€<sup>~</sup>Pushover.â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Really? But that doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t make sense.â€<sup>TM</sup> I peer at the clue trying to annotate the word.

â€<sup>~</sup>You are a pushover,â€<sup>TM</sup> she repeats, shaking her head without looking up.

Suddenly I feel my chest squeeze, my breath falter. I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t move, not even to look at her.

I sit staring at the page, my eyes fixated on the words that begin to become sullied. A bit later, my eyes burn. I look away but realise sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s finally pricked my pride. Weâ€<sup>TM</sup>re at the end of our time anyway. I say goodbye and think of it no more.

The word raises its ugly head the next morning along with the flush of the toilet. I stir, then curl up. â€<sup>~</sup>I have a headache today. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not going for a walk. Can you reduce the volume?â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Aumâ€¦â€<sup>TM</sup> he chants.

I pull the pillow over my ears.

When he begins to huff over his surya namaskars, I shuffle to the kitchen to begin the coffee.

â€<sup>~</sup>I AM NOT,â€<sup>TM</sup> I say aloud, as I feed left-over idli crumbs to the pigeons cooing at the window-sill.

It feels like Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m coming down with a virus. My body tires and slacks. I stay in bed the next morning too. I miss my walks for a week.

Madan is sympathetic. Life goes on. â€<sup>~</sup>We have to go to the bank. I need a DD.â€<sup>TM</sup>

Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m back by his side, listening as the clerk makes small talk while he prepares Madanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s DD.

â€<sup>~</sup>Maybe I am a pushover,â€<sup>TM</sup> I think, unconsciously.

Sunday rolls along. I have a splitting headache again. Mohanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s friend, Ram comes into the kitchen as Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m making the coffee.

â€<sup>~</sup>Can I have a glass of water, please?â€<sup>TM</sup> He smiles, all sweetness.

â€<sup>~</sup>Why canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you take turns?â€<sup>TM</sup> I ask him.

â€<sup>~</sup>Excuse me?â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Does the card party always have to be at this house?â€<sup>TM</sup> I hand him the glass of water. He walks away, avoiding my eyes.

Within minutes, the men folk burst into laughter in the living room. Madan storms into the kitchen. â€<sup>~</sup>What do you mean?â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not feeling well.â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>That doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t warrant being rude to my friends!â€<sup>TM</sup>

I finish pouring the coffee and set the tumblers in a tray. â€<sup>~</sup>Can you please take this out?â€<sup>TM</sup>

He accepts
