Choitra (or summer) lasts pretty much the entire year in Chinsurah, Sector Hughly, Precinct 34 in Wes Bangal, the 44th year since the Great Upheaval.

The winters provide respite by way of an icy, cold breeze which brings work on all the farms and factories in the area to a halt from December till February. The only other break which the working class enjoys is the advent of ‚Äoekal baishak‚Äù, the predictable thunder which accompanies the unpredictable rain (before the Bengali month of Baishakh in April every year).

The time is considered auspicious. Especially since it marks the end of the never-ending summer or ‚Äoechoitra‚Äù as it is better known in the region.

To new beginnings‚Ä¶is the hand-me-down mantra, passed on from generations till it has reached the house of little Anika, who turns 8 weeks old today on the very day that the State celebrates the washing away of the grime of the 45th year of the New State.

Anika‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s birthday too shall be celebrated with the minimal ceremony afforded to girl children in the working class community ‚Ä" a day off from their respective cotton field/toy factory to indulge in the childish privileges of a train visit to the nearby megalopolis of Koolicat.

A year later, beyond the Communal Wall dividing the Working Class quarters from the Touch-Me-Nots in Chinsurah, another child enjoys the birthday attention due to her: ebullient little Sonia at 7 weeks old, is extremely amused by the idea of grabbing the toy that is being dangled by her mother in front of her.

Try as she might, she can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem to reach out to grab the elusive toy, which keeps passing across her face. Each time, she lets out a bubbly cheer when the toy is near and follows it up with a distinctive gargling sound when she misses it time and again.

Her mother lets the game linger on for a bit, before she returns to her parlour to ensure her make-up is on point for the elaborate family dinner; with which she will be welcoming her visiting in-laws. While she loves taking great pride in selecting her choice of cuisine and cutlery, Sonia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother of course wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have managed any of the hullaballo which the occasion guaranteed without the help of trusted ol‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Sakshi.

---

In time, soon enough, Sakshi started bringing along her (now year-old) daughter, Anika to babysit Sonia.

Sakshi, who grew up wanting to get married as a lifelong childhood mission to escape the long-line of factory working that her family had been assigned to, was eternally grateful to Memsahib-‚Äùdidi‚Äù for picking her out of the toy factory line and asking her to babysit little Sonia; while on a weekend, winter-picnic to the seasoned shores of Chinsurah.

And thus began the inevitable yet mutually-shared childhood of Anika and Sonia ‚Ä" under the ever-watchful eyes of Sakshi, who worked away, cleaning each and every corner of the mansion in which the Memsahib lived, especially for fear of a reprimand from Bada Sahib.

---

In time, differences became obvious between the lives of the two growing children: be it the fancy clothes Sonia was gifted every year or even just the gifts which came her way - Anika was always a shadow to her well-being and of course all the celebrations.

Till the day, things came to a head.

The 57th year of the New State saw both girls turn eleven/twelve respectively and also witnessed the arrival of that special moment in every girl-child's dreams: the State-approved, gift of choice for all young, virtuous, girls of age (who would surely make lovely wives for future meritorious husbands) - the sanskaar-approved, ‚ÄoeShona-Moni‚Äù doll.

Or, as every girl from the time would have you know, the apex toy of choice for all women nee girls who by law ought to get married and work upon their marriage to provide sovereign sons for the Great Nations's Reserve Forces. Not only was it a practice which was encouraged but it also supposedly brought much goodwill and marital bliss for these child brides of the day.

Squeeze the doll and it blurts out the tragic truth of their lives:

‚ÄoeMeye-ra toh shona-moni,‚Äù ‚ÄoeBiye na hole aaschche shoni!‚Äù

‚Äoe(Girls are most beloved; If not married, trouble come-th!)‚Äù

---

Truth be told, it was also the reason why the other girls in Anika's village played different games. Girls from the worker class didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t play house. Their pre-destined lot in life involved toiling in the factory or field while a lucky few imagined themselves with the good fortune of getting married to some clerk for the betterment of life and hearth.

And so too, Sonia and unknowingly Anika were seldom to be found without the newly gifted doll of fashion - which led to much repeated, peals of laughter and comic iterations of the doll's now iconic one-liner which ran through the house until the day, Anika had the last laugh.

And the doll ceased to utter its chiseled refrain on gendered, socio-economic expectations from life.

As you can imagine, the repercussions of Anika‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mishap involved a separation of the two children, for good. One bemused, the other distraught with grief; soon replaced by one severely chided and the other consoled.

-----

Six years to the day the doll last spoke, as luck would have it, Anika finds herself somewhat meaningfully employed by the Baby Doll (Vol. 5) East India Company (BDEIC) and being the newest worker to hit the production floor, her role in the production process requires her to provide the voice-over for the ‚ÄoeShona-Moni‚Äù doll from the nightmare of her dreams.

Day after day, she fine-tunes the voice/refrain of the now-iconic doll (whose demand as a symbol of stature begets not only the rich and famous but also the aspiring middle class) and stands in-line voicing the very refrain which seems to hound her existence as a lonely, factory girl with marital prospects close to none.

How could she even dream of a future (let alone marriage), she with her debts to the ever-zealous zamindars for the two, tiny bighas of land she calls home?

---

It was raining since noon the day the tides turned.

Somehow, due to a mechanical overload on the factory line (and since the next-table Mashima (Aunt-ji) was double-timing on the hair/make-up component), the engines stalled and the ten CCTV cameras of (BDEIC) were momentarily snoozed.

Quick as lightning, Anika rushes to re-record the bane of her existence.

---

It's Maha Shashti and the sixth day of celebrations across the State. This time, it's Sonia‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s little girl who anxiously opens up her Pujo gift to find a beloved ‚ÄoeShona-Moni‚Äù doll!

Only this time, when squeezed, the doll says:

‚ÄoeMeye-ra toh shona-moni, Biye Na Korle Maha-Rani!‚Äù
