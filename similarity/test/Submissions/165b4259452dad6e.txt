A Short Story 

By the end of the third week Dheeraj had outgrown his need to keep me confined to the quarters as much as possible. Normally, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lunch alone in the big dining room on the ground floor, processing the loud ticking of the old grandfather clock, and the lazy silence that enveloped that and everything else. Leela would make herself scarce having set everything on the table. I would serve myself, humming softly. This suited me fine. Sometimes an old emaciated gardener would be the source of my humming prompt. His snipping a rhythmic beat accompanying the thumping of the clock and my own heart. It beat loudly at the proceedings on the lawn - a drying field, patches of green here and there, the uneven growth that found its trimmer right around the time I sat there for the only meal of the day I could eat in peace anyway. Breakfast was a hurried by the bed activity with Dheeraj keeping an eye. Dinner was usually on the verandah on some unsuited for such activity outdoor furniture. A low wicker table and two low wicker lounge chairs. Dheeraj would talk about his day not caring whether I paid attention or not. Leela took him and uncle lunch at work. This fact spilled out during one of Dheeraj‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dinner-time monologues. He praised his adopted sister Leela, and one time, he had tears in his eyes when he recounted an especially harrowing episode involving his parents and her ex-husband. I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been paying attention as usual, and just tuned in at the word ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>bastard‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> because I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never heard anyone use that word in person until then. That was also the only time I interrupted. He wiped his eyes dry while I expressed polite sympathy for the pitiable circumstances that someone I barely knew had had to endure eons ago. For a long time after that he said nothing and only commented as he placed his head on the pillow by my feet, that I had a beautiful sympathetic voice, as opposed to the one I used normally. I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ever heard the human pitch and tone get decimated that way, just for the purposes of describing it. I smiled self-consciously, and stared at his feet, aligned right next to my nose. A gnawing feeling that had lodged itself in me on my wedding day, resurfaced subduing all others, as I tried to go to sleep. The alien feeling highlighted my discomfort, was my discomfort, and was sometimes so pronounced, I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t breathe. Only sleep would dab at that heaviness and set my senses dull. Dheeraj was usually snoring long before my nerves would settle, the snoring oddly becoming the firing gun at the starting point where that process would initiate. 

That evening he announced that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be dining at uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s, where Leela had moved for the day so she could help host the dinner to which certain other luminaries from out of town had also been invited.  I was upset at the short notice. Dheeraj offered no explanation or apology when I complained wondering how they could have kept this a secret when obviously plenty of planning must have been involved. I dressed up, as I would be expected to, behind an open wardrobe door because Dheeraj was childishly hogging the bathroom and the dressing area, throwing ties and shirts about, while walking all around in his underwear and socks. I noted this down in my mental diary as attempt number two to draw me into the domesticities that I had until now carefully avoided. 

‚ÄoeI really should decline the invitation making it clear how insulted I am!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI told you three days ago. You weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t paying attention! Can you get me my navy blazer please?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNo. I am not yet decent. It will take a while.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeFine. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just put on a dhoti. No one will mind.‚Äù 

I did. I cringed at the vision that popped into my head, of a shirtless, dhoti-clad, Dheeraj trying to grab my hand now and then to please his uncle. I flung the blazer his way, and he caught it expertly. We were both out the door in fifteen minutes. The short walk over was pleasant. I breathed in the air realizing how much I missed the freedom of frolicking about the outdoors whenever I felt like it. As a daughter-in-law, I would now be expected to have a very good reason for stepping outside my own house my mother had warned. I glanced up at the stars and smiled happily. Dheeraj watched as he trudged ahead craning his neck, looking bemused. I spread my arms wide and smiled widely, whispering, ‚ÄoeMoon!‚Äù Over and over. It was a habit from my childhood, encouraged by my besotted parents and indulged in by my most recent boyfriend whose name was a synonym.  I stopped abruptly when I realized that, and walked quickly to keep pace. 

Soon we were there. We were the last ones to arrive. Leela was decked up and beaming. Uncle in his uniform, his medals shining under the brilliance of a chandelier, smiled formally, a regal smile he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d obviously been holding on to for the right audience. His lips went up on both sides evenly, spanning symmetrically across the lower half of his face, the ends reaching for this flat ears. His eyes twinkled with wisdom and kindness. His graying hair flowed abundant and thick, and he seemed at ease being the only one among his peers to not have a shining pate stare back up at the lights on the ceiling. This was a gathering of his old classmates, a reunion. I groaned inwardly wondering how many prying eyes would take apart our non-happening marriage. When Leela sat down next to me, at the dinner table, I quickly realized she was the guest of honor here. She was being set up with a man who sat across from her who was currently looking at her with hungry, devouring, eyes. 

No one paid attention to me, to my delight, and hence I forgot all about the act I had practiced for this evening, where Dheeraj might have had some of his manipulations actualized. For his part, he began his daily attempts anyway, chattering on as he sat next to me on the other side about the young man and his well-decorated father. Leela nudged me now and then, and soon I picked up on how I was supposed to put the prospective groom in his place when she did that, setting him back on the path of proper decorum that Leela herself was the author of, improvising as the evening progressed. 

‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not supposed to kick my legs!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s piling the *vadas* on my plate!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s staring at my necklace!‚Äù 

At the last one, I was pleased to clear my throat and use my eyes to direct him towards other suitable objects he might want to gaze upon like the shoe rack on the other side of the patio door. He colored up and avoided my eyes forever. 

Dheeraj watched the whole thing and laughed silently, shaking with mirth, and I found that endearing. I had such an ego! I smiled briefly at Dheeraj not wanting to encourage him in any way and reverted my attention back to the goings on around the table. The groom to be, he wished, was now behaving himself. Leela whispered in my ear, ‚Äoethis one is yet another no go. Tell him. Tell your husband.‚Äù I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to since that would involve whispering close to my husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ear. I sat there, impassive, and Leela took it to mean I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to accept her refusal. She turned to face me, uncaring of the other eyes around us, all on us both now, and glared with all her slightly might. Uncle came to my rescue. 

‚ÄoeSuhana, Dheeraj tells me you love to read. After dinner I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll show you my library.‚Äù 

The groom, the nerve of the that fellow, guffawed and slapped uncle and yelled, ‚ÄoeShe‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s too young for you! And married!‚Äù 

Leela stared open-mouthed and the groom‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dad yelled, ‚ÄoeHe had a peg before dinner‚Äù, as a  hurried and weak explanation. Uncle replied calmly, ‚ÄoeWhy don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t  you join us?‚Äù And Dheeraj said, ‚ÄoeNo. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be joining Leela and me for an informal chat, eh Leela?‚Äù And Leela, the poor subdued-by-extreme-care, fully grown, once married adult, nodded vigorously and bowed her head down. The dinner party dispersed and I rushed after uncle, happy to seek out suggestions for reading.  The man had already launched into one of his soliloquies about the adventure that is the activity of getting lost in a good book. His favorable-towards-scholars debate got prompt affirmations from me, and yet, he continued on as if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d raised objections to every single tenet. When we got to the large room, the smell of freshly bound books hit me like a breath of under-the-moon fresh air. It was welcoming and divine, because I could immediately see days of fun-filled activity ‚Ä" reading - books currently housed on well-laid horizontal shelves and circular display cases. 

‚ÄoeWhy uncle, this is impressive!‚Äù I let out a low sigh, unable to contain myself. 

‚ÄoeWelcome my dear. Anytime. In fact, here is a set of keys.‚Äù He thrust a bunch of keys at me. The thing hung there between us for a second too long for his comfort as I mulled over a thought. Would he be as welcoming if he knew? I had no choice but to accept his gift lest he found out. I grabbed it after a short pause and giggled gleefully. 

‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like owning your own fully loaded library.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even seen the catalogue yet!‚Äù 

I rushed over to the shelves all clearly marked. My unbridled enthusiasm was jabbed by a vision in the shadows behind a hidden display case. I let out a short scream. Uncle caught up and looked over my shoulder at the figure in rags curled up on the floor, snoring softly. 

‚ÄoeWho‚Ä¶ who is that?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeOh just another friend who needed a roof over his head. They don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stay long. I put them here for their own good. The cold hard floors. The privacy. Ever since I closed this to the public, no one comes here but me. Now there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be you.‚Äù 

I did not understand what was going on. 

‚ÄoeYou can just ignore those fellows.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThere is more than one?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNot right now. This man is a down-on-his-luck ad executive. Drinking and philandering drove his family apart. Now he regrets it. Penniless, he wants me to take him to the local ashram. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be done in a week.‚Äù 

In all that time, the man hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stirred. Uncle whispered loudly, ‚ÄoeSedated for his own good.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHere is what I recommend to every person who comes in here for the very first time. ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Profiles in Courage‚Äù by John F Kennedy. Have you read it?‚Äù 

I shook my head no. I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t very keen on reading anything written by that other philanderer, but I refrained from being forthright about my opinions. Instead I said I would think about it. Uncle nodded and said, ‚ÄoeIt is all yours now anyway. You and Dheeraj are the ones this family has hopes on.‚Äù He paused before adding, ‚ÄoeI know you both will do well. My sister-in-Law‚Ä¶‚Äù he let his voice trail and I could instantly sense his sorrow. ‚ÄoeI was still in school when my brother brought her home one day. No one knows this but me; they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d run off together. I was asked to keep the secret. Later my brother managed to bring her back here legally through the arranged marriage channel. You ask her about this,‚Äù his eyes twinkled wickedly, ‚Äoeand she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll deny everything! Anyway that was years ago. She is like an older sister to me. We grew even closer after my brother died. And now, she has the fatalities. The death. The lingering kind.‚Äù He stood there his eyes stuck on the hobo on the cool marble floor of his majestic library. 

I had nothing to say. Then I asked, ‚ÄoeDoes Dheeraj know?‚Äù 

Uncle turned to me, looking surprised. ‚ÄoeGood question! I did try telling him, but he does not believe me. You see, people around here assess me wrongly as a clown. But you believe me don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you?‚Äù 

I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t doubted the authenticity of his claims even for a second, but what did I know about whom to trust? I had been fooled many times by people I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d deemed extremely trustworthy, like a man who once had professed eternal love to me and whose name was a Hindi synonym for moon. 

‚ÄoeIf it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all that important,‚Äù I shrugged. 

‚ÄoeOf course it is. Some day you might find this detail useful, like when you write that book that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no doubt in your head.‚Äù 

I gasped at his assumption, however accurate. He was already heading towards the door, ‚ÄoeCome, we must rescue poor Leela.‚Äù 

Leela stayed over that night. As Dheeraj and I walked home, he commented about how he felt optimistic about this alliance. I squished the scorn from erupting, and switched topics by dangling the keys. Dheeraj did not look surprised. 

‚ÄoeOh that, yes he asked me if you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like that. I said yes.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou did? When?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhen? How does that matter?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI mean, how did you guess?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeEnglish literature major. Five books in each suitcase. New book on your bedside every day. Reading at lunch Shalu said‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only because no one is around.‚Äù 

‚Äoe‚Ä¶so I made a calculated assumption‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAnd the hobo?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat about him?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeIt does not bother you that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be there when I go in tomorrow?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhy should it?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWe could spend hours discussing the philosophies of life.‚Äù 

We were home. Dheeraj grabbed me by the shoulders and warned, ‚ÄoeStay away from those people. All of them are disturbed and desperate. None of those strays have ever done anything criminal, not yet, but‚Ä¶‚Äù 

The stricken look in my eyes brought the rushed warning to a halt. He dropped his hands to his sides and looked unsure for a second, before he spoke again, his earlier urgency replaced by his natural calm, ‚ÄoeNothing will happen. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be afraid. Uncle is a good judge of character.‚Äù With that he walked away, and the portentous feeling from that other moment dissipated like dust from the tail of a falling star. 

Soon it was raining and that meant the summer heat that lingered perennially would disperse, sinking into the wetness, burdening it with a sigh, corrupting its freshness. Everything would feel cool, but like something dead rather than refreshing and alive. Madurai was where the summers hurt. I recalled the detailed weather reports from my parents‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> visits over the years. 

As the humidity found us, I sat there bravely, while Dheeraj flung his clothes off and wrapped a length of fresh white cotton around his waist, the dhoti, which he was now folding up into a knee-length skirt. 

‚ÄoeYou should change into something more comfortable, Suhana.‚Äù 

I pictured myself in the two-piece bikini that I never wore on my honeymoon as was suggested by my married cousin. I glared at Dheeraj as if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d colluded with the weather Gods just to help himself. 

Eventually, I found a wraparound and settled in to read before bed. 

‚ÄoeWhat did you think about Derek?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sorry, Who?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeDerek Sebastian, the groom. The brigadier‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s son?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeHe isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even Hindu?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeLike you care.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNo. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t . I am just surprised you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeLeela? A divorc√©e? Who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll marry her? We tried.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThat guy was drunk, and he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a letch.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBut he only had eyes for Leela.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeThe wrong kind of eyes. Did she agree?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeShe said she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll think about it. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be more willing if you talk to her.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI will, but I have to be honest.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeListen to her first. The boy isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t all bad. He has money. The family is well-respected.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI am guessing this isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t their first social project?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNo. His older brother married a widow. So you see‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWell, okay. If she likes him.‚Äù I did my best to sound enthusiastic. 

Dheeraj stared like he couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe his ears. ‚ÄoeShe isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t being coerced. By me or anyone else.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeAre you sure? The minute I get here you set this up. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like you were waiting for exactly this moment to get rid of her or something.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNo, Suhana, she was waiting. We never kept her chained down. She promised that once I was married‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I choked a gasp. Married, what did that mean really? We were two people who shared a room, went to sleep on the same bed, amused each other with a few anecdotes, but were we married? Dheeraj almost missed it, but then he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. He nodded briefly and turned away.  My mind wandered, desperate for an appropriate save. It almost seemed undoable, the ball was over the boundary line, but then‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄoeMy grandmother always used to say, everything happens for a reason. It may just be Leela‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s  time to find happiness.‚Äù 

Dheeraj turned to look at me. We stared at each other for several seconds. He wanted to say something, I was sure, but then he just nodded again and walked out into the balcony uncaring about the pouring rain. 

THE END
