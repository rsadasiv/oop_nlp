Subject: A Letter To Her Husband
To: outofprintmagazine@gmail.com

She couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember when she last left her work an hour earlier. It was barely seven and she was in the residential complex she called home, and that she shared with other two twenty families.

‚ÄoeHello, Mrs. Muzumdar,‚Äù a flamboyant neighbour said near the elevator.

‚ÄoeHi‚Äù, she replied coldly and resumed walking.

‚ÄoeIs everything alright?‚Äù The inquisitive neighbour asked.

‚ÄoeOf course‚Äù, she answered, albeit similarly, and entered the elevator. As the door closed, she wished she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to meet another of these pokey friends. As it turns out, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.

She hurriedly unlocked the door, entered the house, turned on the lights, slammed the door behind her and threw herself onto the sofa. You see, if you knew Meher Khanna, you would know that she was a strong, independent graduate who everyone thought would bring glory to her family. And she did until she joined MBA school and fell for the first professor who taught her. And a year later, two trimesters ahead of her finals, she left it all for the man and became Meher Muzumdar. Of course, there were objections. They belonged to different sects, different backgrounds and then there was age. Mr. Muzumdar was ten years elder and if you are a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>normal‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> Indian family, that is one thing you couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ignore. But, despite their disapproval, the two wedded each other, at the cost of barely seeing their families. Ten years passed and it still felt like yesterday to her. Oh, how much she wished she hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t...

The first year was good. They had holidayed at all the beautiful places around the world. You name it, they had seen it. Of course, it took a heavy toll on his job, which he had to leave owing to all this. He found another, within weeks, but this one was a little farther away. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where the trouble began.

Meher took a tiny purse out of her bag, and went to her bedroom. Only a dim light over the writing table (the other one needed to be replaced) made it mandatory that she sit at the table. And she did. She slowly unzipped the purse, looked carefully at the sole component it was carrying-a rat poison bottle. A tiny one. The tiniest the shop had. She placed it on one corner of the table-the farthest- and then produced a full-length paper from the drawer under. She took out her lucky pen- she had been refilling the same one for six years-and took a deep breath.

Dear Mr. Muzumdar,

This was supposed to be a suicide note., she began. She had this one line prepared and it was truer than God. She took the tiny veil of poison in her hand, opened it partially, sighed once and threw it down. Off it went and spilled all of its fatal liquid onto the floor. Meher smiled, for she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even have to wipe it off.

But I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not a coward. I thought I hated my life but I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not my life that I hate. Not all of it, I suppose. Just a tiny part that has rotten over time. A small part that has been infested by a parasite. And, sorry to say, that parasite is you. I thought killing myself would be a good way to get away from all of it. But then I realised how much I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll miss my life. I know you think how I live is worthless, just another of the possibly eight billion people on this planet, one of those billions who just come and go, without having done anything big. I am not sure how well you would take this, Mr. Muzumdar, but I find your life more worthless. More shitty. ... Just a thought.

She paused. This wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t about Mr. Muzumdar. This was about her. She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to waste any words on whining about her husband.

Then again, who am I to judge? So, I decided to not give you the pleasure of walking over my dead body to your supposedly ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>new and better life‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. 

You see, Mr. Muzumdar, this isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t an antic. Not one of my weak threats to you. This is the real deal. I am not very good with words so maybe this letter won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t move you, make you feel guilty as you should, or make you come to me, begging for forgiveness. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even bother, Mr. Muzumdar, because I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be anywhere you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d think I would be. 

The notion scared her. Meher was thirty-six now and she hardly had a handful of friends. Only two or three of those who would help her in such troubled times. She had her brother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house, of course, where her mother lived. But she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go there. Her mother had hardly forgiven her for the marriage and now, if she went there ditching the same thing which created that chasm, the door would be slammed at her face. And then there was the society to think about. It is a life-threatening situation out there, where anyone, and practically everyone can judge you. Call you names. Tease you. Blame you. Or just look at you. And when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re on the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>wrong side‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, only those looks are enough to kill. She wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sure where exactly she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d go. But it wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be here, at least.

So, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come finding me... Who are we kidding, right? No one is coming to find me. And I am happy about it. 

Now, if you think this thing suddenly came onto your doorstep, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s be clear- It is not sudden. It has been inside of me all this while. It has been growing since that cold night when you first hit me. 

She recalled that night, some eight years ago, when her husband had first beaten her. And why? Only because the Veg. Handi was a little spicier. He had come into the kitchen and forced her to eat a spoonful of it, then had pushed her against the kitchen counter when she had admitted to her fault, where the steel handle of a drawer had banged her hand. A red swelling had come to life. The next day, she had threatened him that she would leave him. And Mr. Muzumdar had apologized sincerely. He had promised it won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happen again. Until it did...

And every time after that. Every time you forced me into being intimate with you when you were drunk. You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d wake up every morning as if nothing happened. But I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just forget it all. I always wondered why women just tolerate husbands like these. Like you. Are they so weak? So spineless? I am not. But I swallowed it too. You know why? Because I thought it would end. Because I thought you love me. Maybe, you do. But I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see it. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t beat someone you love. No matter what. 

Cheesy, right? Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not be. In just a few words, I am leaving you, Mr. Muzumdar. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want anything from you. And please check your house once you are done with this letter. I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stolen anything. And, I am also leaving everything of mine. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want anything that reminds me of you. No clothes, no shoes, no jewellery. Well, except this one. She caressed the pendant she was wearing. The one you had gifted me that day. 

That was the worst day Meher had had to live. Her child had died that day. A fairy, two days shy of three years, slept quietly at nine and never woke up. Doctors said that she had a cardiac arrest. A three year old! That night, Mr. Muzumdar had given the pendant he was going to gift his daughter on her birthday. And she had cried on his shoulders, shedding every last drop of grief she had. And he had let her. Just like a husband should.

It is painful that that day of grief is possibly the only fond memory I have of you. Maybe, you would argue on this. But again, I am in no mood. Today, as I think of that, I feel relieved. Happy, even. My sweet daughter didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t live long. But at least, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to see her parents like this every day of her life. Fighting. Arguing. Cursing each other. Wishing that the other one dies...

I know you think that too. I have lost count of how many times I have wished you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never come back from work. That I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have to rush to a hospital where I could see you dying on your bed. She sighed. But it is selfish, I agree. Everyone deserves to live. So, if living together means dying, let us not.

If you want to be formal, I am ready to sign any papers you can offer. If you want to fight me, I would join the battle. But believe me, save yourself some time and money and just let this go. 

I know what you must be thinking. What about your family? Your friends? Our friends? Our neighbours? What will you say? I have no idea myself. But if societal flak is the one thing you get for all your sins, Oh, I wish you get it all.

She chuckled. I can totally write! She realised. Of course, she had to think of what she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d do after she leaves. Maybe this, she considered.

I am leaving my keys alongside this note. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry. Change the locks if you like. I am not returning, not even to rob. And, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry about my office. I have resigned. And, well, thank you for letting me work there.

It was a tough job, she remembered, trying to convince him. All he had to say was Why do you need to work? Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you trust me? Am I incapable of fulfilling your wishes? Or you just don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like this house enough? Meher just wanted to shut his stupid mouth up but couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. What amazed her the most was this guy taught. Then again, ancient mindsets don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t require an eligibility criterion. Somehow, he agreed. Turns out, he wanted the money. And what would a good wife do?

Of course.

And obviously, you would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve guessed that my stipend is no longer available for your liquor. Maybe, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time you withdraw some of your savings for the same. And, again, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even want you to return that. After all, you fed me. 

She paused. A tiny tear had come to life. She was having doubts. Second thoughts. After all, Mr. Muzumdar had done no harm in the past two months. Maybe, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the end of it. Maybe, it was all in the past. She thought of the good future that could be in store for her. A doting husband who has had his warning, a lifetime of pleasant intimacy, a new job, dinner with friends, maybe a vacation once in a while, all those gifts, probably a child... She put the pen down. Was she just about to kick a lifetime of joy?

And the tear smoothly rushed down her cheek.

Something inside her snapped. No! No! The thing shouted. After all the courage she had mustered, not a stupid hope would crush it. She had to do it. And today.

I am not sure what I am leaving. Maybe, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve changed. Maybe, it was all going to change. Maybe, the past is gone. But, frankly, Mr. Muzumdar, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the courage to bear the consequences if it hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the energy. I just can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.

I honestly love you. Still do. I know you do, too. In your own masculine way. Maybe that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how you have been raised-taking the women in your life for granted. But I just cannot be one of those millions of women who live like that, like I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have anything worthy in me. Maybe, I am being dramatic. Maybe, the feminism bug has just crawled into me. But, for one, I find it true. I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able to survive one more day like this. And I hope you understand. 

Forgive me, if I did something wrong. I forgive you. Because, without that I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t move forward. Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t try to contact me, though. I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bear listening to your voice again. Or seeing you. I will think of you as a chapter. A bad chapter. And turn the page over. And begin with a new one.

I hope you find love again. And please don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t treat her the way you treated me. Maybe, you won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even get a warning the next time.

Thank you for making me stronger.

 Yours Meher Muzumdar.

She gently folded the letter and placed it back onto the table. She kept her keys, her phone and her purse by the side. She stretched her hands and was about to leave when something struck. She wanted to say this. For long now. She opened the letter and rushed straight to the end.

P.S. Fuck you.
