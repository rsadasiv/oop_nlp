The Mark 

Nabina Das 

Now that I have spoken a little about my career and revealed my name to the world, it seems I could tell a little more to my listeners. No, this is not purgation on the shrink‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s couch. As a top woman sleuth who has been active even after retirement from the hallowed portals of the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s prestigious secret services, you can imagine how much my mind and body must have endured. 

The mind is pure conditioning. Investigators, spies, sleuths and agents know that all over the world. But what about the body? You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d say, why, it is pure training. Agree to a large extent. But remember, after what you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve experienced, the body reacts to another regime, much as the mind. 

Am going about in circles here? I, Tejimola ‚Ä" now that you know my name ‚Ä" will soon try tell you about the body. My body. While I know as a top female sleuth of the country‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s topmost secret service agency, ordinary citizens have no clue as to what training or conditioning our bodies undertake. Our bodies. Women. Us. Especially when we are dispatched off to a remote place for an operation. When we sit eat and sleep among scores who are not women. When we differentiate a professional physical contact from the one that is invasive and offensive. When we want to scream there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nothing but pitiful gaze and hungry wrath, both from your rivals as well as the so-called nurturers. 

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t easy to speak. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like dramatizing issues, even though this is about myself, my body, my honor, my well being. For example, I could describe the surprise when a senior instructor, obviously a male, would brush my bottom with a light pat, as though that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how hundreds of young female recruits go past the training barriers. I could explain the wincing of the skin when a finger lingered on during a handshake, a stroke that tried to feel the sheen of the skin. Then I could describe the sudden late night phone calls and even knocks because a sleuth never sleeps and is always ready to attend to duty. 

Are you saying this is not at all disturbing? Are you saying a little catcall behind my cute back or a light thump ‚Ä" remember Rupan Bajaj? ‚Ä" is something to be appreciated? You must be thinking, this woman, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reasonably still attractive and in good shape, has but lost her mind and is going about things that are trivial. Nothing that proves to traumatize the body as such for her at this stage. The body which is supple, glowing, desiring, disarming and distracting. Ah, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a poet, given to alliteration in those last words. And I recount a body from my past. 

This means, I, Tejimola, one of the top sleuths the country has seen, will now have to settle down into a crude takedown of what goes on with even illustrious agents like me. This is a woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s narrative. A story where despite the stock training of bearing stern shackles cutting into the flesh and clothes ripping off of one‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back and lying spread-eagled on a hard floor or a bench, the body senses the shock and the horror of being prodded, torn, invaded and trashed. 

It was one of my Tezpur stints. What a coincidence ‚Ä" Tejimola in Tezpur. ‚ÄoeTez‚Äù means blood, as could ‚Äoetej‚Äù, a phonetic variation. All of you read it in my earlier account. This time we were gone to meet an insurgent delegation near Orang tea estate, not far from Tezpur town. Pretty town, if you ask me. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve spent some part of my childhood there when our family house used to be there, buzzing during Bihu and other festivals. Orang is prettier. Deep green tea bushes, colorfully dressed garden laborers among them, sound of muted flute and dholak at night, and local rice wine. What was not pretty was the delegation in question. The top terrorist outfit in the region was its mastermind. Kidnapping and ransom seeking had given way to severed heads in burlap sacks and bullet riddled bodies in that pristine surrounding. Jarring, with the overall calm and storybook-like quaintness of the place. 

Not pretty at all, I found out about this delegation which we went to meet blindfolded, at the dead of the night. By we, I mean just the two of us ‚Ä" Officer Kanak Basumatary and myself, Tejimola Saikia. The terrorist outfit operating from Orang had a sizeable Bodo tribal population. Hence, sending Officer Basumatary to be my compatriot in this assignment was a wise choice. Tall, strong and handsome, Kanak wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t too striking though. Of moderate built, poker faced and languid of gaze. For a man and a secret agent, his limbs moved slowly. As though he was swimming in an invisible pool. No, I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t attracted towards him as such. But he could keep my boring moments occupied with some laughter and odd jokes. Especially, he had a funny way of singing ‚ÄoeTejore kamalapati‚Ä¶‚Äù while stressing on ‚Äoetejore‚Äù to pun with my name Tejimola. Here of course that first word meant ‚Äoequit‚Äù but nonetheless, the spin on tez, tej, tejore and Tejimola amused us both. We laughed together heartily at that. We weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t familiar with each other. Usually in assignments, the agency pitched two strangers or more together so the operation takes a more definitive twist and yet retains a certain classified characteristic. Therefore, I knew little about Kanak Basumatary ‚Ä" who he really was, if he had family, what was his formal education, and all that. I bet even he thought the same about me although I was the more well known of the two. My reputation was legendary already. My personal charm was stuff of lore. So all we had to do in Orang is pretend to be love birds in the eyes of the public. Only our bosses and our enemies knew who we were. 

So there we went, deep inside the bosom of Orang, almost till the foothills, bundled in darkness and Diazepum in my case. I must admit, this operation gave me a very jittery feeling right from the beginning. Especially, the night before when Kanak and I decided to gift ourselves a little good time disobeying the dictum of the bosses. Some alcohol and good conversation can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t harm much. I was still jittery. 

We had, however, made up our minds to catch the bad guys. So when the signal came for us to move, we shook a V for victory sign to each other from the blindfolded unknownness, confident in our successes. I felt the rumble of a big vehicle. A Bolero? Heavy tire-crunching of dry leaves within five minutes. Well, Orang is a quick exit into forests all around, I knew. No idea if Kanak was in the same car for I never heard his voice. They didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t tape our mouths, so no question of not being able to speak or grunt or cough. I could hear whispers around me. Like those stage whispers we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d learnt in college in our theater group. But it was tough catching any sentence. So much was the swish of the whispers around my head that all of a sudden when a voice actually spoke, I nearly jumped out of my skin. 

Kanak couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be speaking so strangely here, I thought. But it was his voice. ‚ÄoePark and leave!‚Äù 

Already I was out of the Bolero and inside a place that smelled of fresh bamboo leaves and cow dung cakes. 

A soft hand took off the blindfold. Not easy to see immediately, but there was Kanak, stepping back and rolling a cigarette. ‚ÄoeWant?‚Äù I shook my head. He seemed comfortable in my discomfiture. Since we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know officers in our trade closely enough, we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even lodge a proper complaint later. Besides, one always struggles with the gleeful voyeuristic questioning ‚Ä" Did you wear something wrong? Did you entice him by saying anything? Was it your hand movements or your inability to maintain a stern exterior? 

‚ÄoeTejore kamalapati‚Ä¶‚Äù he sang all the while. A hymn, a well known Borgeet, the song haunts me till today. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not what he did. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mostly what he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do to me. Earlier I wrote, ‚Äoethe horror of being prodded, torn, invaded and trashed‚Äù. Kanak or whatever his real name is I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, knew how to make that shock or horror bloom. The feeling bloomed inside me like a bunch of evil flowers. Les Fleurs du Mal, is that what Baudelaire would call them? There were thorns, bees, cactus leaves and things that burst inside me like bullets of stench and squirm. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even have words for them. Kanak wanted a name and I gave him one before fainting. While humming, he did punctuate his actions by saying: ‚ÄoeI like you too much to kill you. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll simply leave my mark on you. I hate being physical anyway.‚Äù And then sang: "Quit your slumber, Kamalapati/wake up it's dawn..." 

I was apparently found around dawn on the Guwahati-Nagaon highway, dehydrated and bloated in the lower half of my body. No idea how the hospital cleaned me up, put me back in shape and set me walking again. Back in office, I was congratulated. There was a major insurgent attack not far from Orang. Instead of the home minister‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s cavalcade, a dummy fleet carrying the local Deputy Commissioner of Police‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s personnel was heavily grenaded. This is the first time grenades were used. Must be dispatched from across the Myanmar border via China. Others think it is the usual Pakistan-Kashmir route. Our job was not to go verify all that. Our job was to see the state or the country remained safe from immediate aggression in micro-regions and sleeper cells. As a specialist investigator, Tejimola Saikia was recommended for one of the highest medals in the field. Only, the mark of the evil flowers she carried inside her gave her reality a stern insight. Especially because the agency didn't encourage any filing of complaint of abuse, sexual aggression, or torture and violation. The agency is a huge ancient banyan tree whose branches don't see each other, so thick is the foliage on each. What might interest you is that I spotted Kanak -- no, he is not Kanak Basumatary but someone else -- during all this ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>celebratory‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> time, even during my medal ceremony. And I thought of the mark I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d return to him, a mark to tell I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m around and vigilant. A mark of vengeance from a woman wronged. In Baudelaire‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s words: 

If rape and poison, dagger and burning, Have still not embroidered their pleasant designs On the banal canvas of our pitiable destinies, It's because our souls, alas, are not bold enough! 

Perhaps I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll tell you about all that in my next story. -x-
