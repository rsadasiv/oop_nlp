â€<sup>~</sup>Meenakshi, Meenakshi where are youâ€<sup>TM</sup>?? screamed Thanu Iyer as he stood near the puja room with folded hands even as he uttered â€<sup>~</sup>namasthesthu mahamayeâ€<sup>TM</sup> and quickly showed the arathi to the Gods and goddesses to the ringing of the brass bell.

â€<sup>~</sup>Please come and take the arathi and have you kept my breakfast readyâ€<sup>TM</sup> he said as he peered into the kitchen. Meenu as she was known, quickly wiped her wet hands in the pallu of her sari and ran her cupped palms over the mangalarathi and touched her eyes.

â€<sup>~</sup>Wear your shirt, while I keep the breakfast on the table â€<sup>~</sup> Meenu said as she bustled back into the kitchen. She had made idlis and coconut chutney to go with it.

The idlis were like mallipoo, soft and spongy and the coconut chutney was the perfect accompaniment for it. She made a small cup of filter coffee to wash the idlis down. â€<sup>~</sup>Meenu have you not ironed my blue bush shirtâ€<sup>TM</sup> yelled Thanu Iyer even as Meenu packed his lunch box.

And before she could answer him came another one â€<sup>~</sup>my hanky is missing, where have you kept itâ€<sup>TM</sup>?? â€<sup>~</sup>Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hanging in the almirah, please take itâ€<sup>TM</sup> shouted Meenu from the kitchen. From the time they were married Meenuâ€<sup>TM</sup>s entire life revolved around her husband and his likes and dislikes.

Meenu was from Palakkad and was married to Thanu Iyer for some 15 yrs. They were childless and lived in Sreekanteswaram near East Fort in Trivandrum. None of the women on their street worked. All the mamis would send their husbands to work and then come out of their homes and from 9.00 AM to 10.30 AM they sat on the bench in front of Parvathy mamiâ€<sup>TM</sup>s house to gossip.

Initially the bored Meenu had joined the group of gaggling women but with years she got bored of the women and their wagging tongues. Their discussions were about some relative and the gold and saris they bought or their children and their accomplishments. Since she had no interest in gold or about children Meenu made excuses to stay at home and then slowly stopped joining them. The mamis distanced her from their group activities, but Meenu was only too happy.

Thanu Iyer was the typical Iyer mama who did not want his wife to work. He married her when she was just a nubile 20yr old. He moulded her into the way he liked his woman to be and Meenu became just that. She could not do anything that she wanted, if he wanted to eat, she had to eat with him, if he wanted to sleep, she had to sleep around the same time. As the years rolled by Meenu was strangled by the noose that was called Love by Thanu Iyer and she resented him for it.

And then one day as Meenu scanned the paper she saw an advertisement calling for trainers in a gym nearby, age was no bar and the trainers would undergo training before they were put on the floor to help customers. Working in a gym was unheard of and that too in an agraharam like Sreekanteswaram.

But Meenu was determined. She first decided to go for shopping for the gym had insisted that the trainers had to be in Track pants, T shirts and sneakers. From the small savings that she had over the years, she took some seven thousand rupees and tucked it into her purse. She quickly locked the door and walked down the street and hailed an auto. Soon she was on her way to the Nike showroom on MG Road.

It was a balmy day and beads of perspiration appeared on her forehead as she mopped them with her kerchief. Soon they approached the showroom and Meenu paid the auto and got into the showroom.

A salesman let Meenu in.

â€<sup>~</sup>I need training shoes, track pants and T Shirts. Can you please show themâ€<sup>TM</sup> asked Meenu haltingly. The sales man looked at her sari clad self and called out to a sales girl who came out of the shadows and muttered something to her.

The girl walked up to Meenu and took her the ladies section and showed her a few good shoes. Meenu took her time and chose a Pink one. Then she went to the track pants section and picked up two track pants and two T shirts. She wore them and they fit her well, she wished she had brought one of the mamis with her to help her make a good choice. But knowing how they would react, she had come on her own.

Since her bill was substantial the showroom gave her a sports bag for free. Meenu proudly stuffed her gym clothes and shoes into the bag and took another auto to the gym. The gym manager was a friendly enterprising lady who showed Meenu around the gym. She gave her a registration form and had her enrolled for training. Initially Meenu would only be paid a stipend and later after the training she would be put on the floor to help the customers. Her timings were from 9AM to 2PM and Meenu was secretly thrilled that she could go and come without worrying about her husband.

So everyday Meenu would wait for her husband to leave in the morning and immediately lock the door and leave for the gym. She would change her clothes in the gym and attended her training sessions and again when it was time to leave the gym, she would change and get back. Her clothes were washed and kept back in her cupboard before her husband returned home and her sneakers were stashed in a locker in the gym.

This went on for a few months and none got a whiff of it especially Thanu Iyer. After three months Meenu was on the floor as a trainer. She was paid a decent salary and she was secretly thrilled. Thanu Iyer noticed that Meenu had become slimmer but she had also become stronger. She never complained of any aches and pains and did not grumble when he yelled at her. She could push herself from morning to night and never complained that she was tired. She had a spring in her step and there was this glow about her which he could not lay his finger on.

One fine day as Meenu was in the kitchen fixing dinner Thanu Iyer came over and told Meenu that he had put on weight and was planning to join the gym nearby. Meenu stopped washing the cooker and Thanu Iyer thought he saw a strange light appear in her eyes. Meenu was thrilled as she heard Thanu Iyer. She knew what she had to do.

Thanu Iyer paid 10k as annual fee to the gym which was also non refundable. Then he was led to the treadmill and he was asked by a male trainer to walk at a steady pace to record his heartbeat. Then he was asked to stretch and touch his toes and also try and touch his back with his two hands. None of it was possible for Thanu Iyer. Then he was asked to do a leg press with weights that was equal to his weight, ideally a healthy and strong man can push twice his weight, but Thanu Iyer could hardly push two times before he started wheezing.

In the meanwhile he heard a commotion near the free weights section, and he heard the trainers talking amongst themselves that a lady trainer was doing a dead lift and he joined the crowd to see a woman with her back towards him doing a dead lift of 50kilos. She repeated it three times amidst cheers of encouragement from the fellow trainers and the customers. Then she jumped up and down a stool in quick succession for a record 10 times, then she did jumping jacks for a minute, then she did ten burpees and then held on a plank for a minute. Then she got up and ran on the tread mill at a speed of 9 for 5 minutes. And all was shot by the Manager of the gym in her mobile to upload on you tube as an encouragement and motivation for all. The lady was pioneering cross fit in her new gym.

Then slowly she turned around and met Thanu Iyerâ€<sup>TM</sup>s gaze, while Thanu Iyerâ€<sup>TM</sup>s face went ashen, Meenu smiled a wicked smile!!!
