Meenakshi was the first among the group of children playing at the seashore to spot the grey lump washed up on the beach. The girl had noticed the strange object while playing hopscotch with a few of her friends, and had rushed towards the grey object without wasting any time. Menakshi stared at the mysterious bulge for a while, and then began removing the cluster of seaweed that coiled around the poor creature. Meenakshi stepped back for a moment and then smiled at the grey animal. She watched the animal lift its head cautiously and utter a faint clicking sound.

Meenakshi was elated, she jumped up and down repeatedly and then signalled for the rest of her friends to come join her.

'It's a dolphin! It's a dolphin!' She cried, but none of the other children paid any attention to her. The reason the others ignored her was because Meenakshi â€" being the youngest of the group â€" had a tendency to exaggerate in order to gain the otherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s attention. For instance, she once told everyone she'd spotted a mermaid which turned out to be no more than a dog heading out for a swim. And when she claimed to have found buried treasure â€" all the others saw was a smelly old suitcase in a dumpster.

'It's a dolphin! It's a dolphin!' Meenakshi cried once again, running towards the crowd of children.

 Meenakshi approached her cousin Aravind, who was staring reflectively at the footprints left behind by Jennifer (the fisherman's daughter). She saw his cousin closing in on him, and at once he lifted his sister off the ground and kissed her on the cheek.

'Where's my little ammani off to in such a hurry?' Aravind asked, gently setting his sister back on the ground.

Meenakshi hated being called his 'little ammani', and she most certainly hated being kissed on the cheek. The little girl wiped her face dry with one hand, took a deep breath, and then began to shriek 'I saw a dolphinâ€"a-dolphinâ€"a-dolphin!' Aravind beamed at his sister and trailed behind her without the slightest bit of hesitation. He didn't care if all he was going to find was a lump of drift wood, or a big nasty garbage bag; he liked humouring his sister's silly imagination, and was curious about what his sister mistook for a dolphin.

Meenakshi stopped abruptly.

'Is this where the dolphin is ammaniâ€"' Aravind found himself at a loss for words. 'That'sâ€"thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>sâ€"a...' he stammered.

'A dolphin!' Meenakshi interrupted, jumping up and down a couple of times.

'YEEeeEEee!' shrieked the dolphin, squirming in the sand.

Aravind at once alerted the other children who were playing football by the beach. 'Come quick!' he yelled, waving his hands at the children by the seashore. Aravind looked delighted; this was the first time he'd ever seen a dolphin.

Within no time, all the children from the beach began to crowd around the dolphin. 'Go touch it, I dare you to!' exclaimed one of the boys.

Suresh, the fattest and perhaps the most pragmatic of the lot, grabbed a stick and approached the dolphin cautiously. Suresh now stood a few feet away from the dolphin â€" he gripped the stick tenaciously, and leaning in on the animal, he gave it a curios prod. The dolphin swayed its tail gently. 'That's not a dolphin, that's a shark!' exclaimed Suresh, dropping his stick in a fit of anxiety.

Everyone but Meenakshi took a step backwards. 'No he's not,' snapped Meenakshi. 'He's a dolphin, and his name is Mani,' she replied, running towards the creature's jaws.

The children gasped in unison. But when they saw Mani wiggle playfully after Meenakshi touched him, they began moving closer towards the animal. 'Don't be afraid, Mani won't bite anyone; he's a good fish,' Meenakshi said, petting the dolphin on its head.

It'd almost been an hour since the children first started playing with Mani. They built sand houses around the animal and laid down beside it â€" pretending to be tenants in Mr. Mani's apartment.

Something seemed terribly wrong with Mani. The dolphin shifted his weight uneasily, but when the children examined him, all they could see was a mouth fixed in a permanent smile. And so the children continued to play with the dolphin. But the more they played with him, the more they began to notice something strange. Mani had become aloof and distant, and it was almost as though he were losing his vitality by the minute.

This is when the children realised that Mani, like all the other dolphins, belonged in the water. The children gathered behind the dolphin with the hopes of pushing the animal back into the water. They tried moving his tail, and then they tried grabbing him by the nose to get a better grip. But regardless of what the children did, all their attempts to push the marooned animal into the sea were in vain.

Half-an-hour had passed, and Mani had still barely moved. As a matter of fact, it looked as though Mani had rolled back a few inches from the sea. Mani just didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t budge, even after Suresh joined the others with their Sisyphean task.

The poor animal stayed put, all it did was stare at the children, and occasionally let out a feeble â€<sup>~</sup>EEeeâ€<sup>TM</sup>. The children continued to push the beached animal, but nothing came of their efforts.

'Is he going to be okay?' It was Jennifer, Aravind could recognize her voice anywhere.

'I'm sure he'll be fine,' replied Aravind, his eyes fixed on Mani â€" it was the first time he'd ever spoken to her.

Eventually, the onset of late evening darkness crept from face to face, stifling the childrenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s laughter and eclipsing their illumination. One after the other the children gave up and stepped away from the dolphin, until at last it was just Aravind and Meenakshi.

Aravind stepped away from the dolphin reluctantly, 'It's time for us to go home ammani,' he said to Meenakshi wistfully. Meenakshi ignored her cousin and continued pushing. 'Ammani, it's getting late,' he said once more. Aravind grabbed his sister by the hand, 'There's nothing we can do,' he said mournfully, kneeling down to Meenakshi's height.

Meenakshi's eyes grew blurry with tears. She shook herself free of Aravind's hold and threw her arms around Mani. Meenakshi hugged the exhausted dolphin with all the strength she could muster, and almost instantly she got back on her feet and spat on the dying animal.

Aravind looked appalled, 'What are you doing?' he barked, grabbing Meenakshi by her shoulders.

'I need to make enough spit for the dolphin to swim away,' she replied, sucking in her cheeks to gather some more saliva.

â€<sup>~</sup>Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not going to work!â€<sup>TM</sup> Aravind cried, tightening his grip on his sister.

Meenakshi didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t care, she wriggled herself out of her cousinâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hold, and began to spit on the dolphin â€" first on its tail, then its body, and then a few inches close to its face. â€<sup>~</sup>Come join me!â€<sup>TM</sup> Meenakshi yelled, â€<sup>~</sup>If we all do it, weâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll create enough water for Mani to swim back.â€<sup>TM</sup>

Aravind loosened his grip on his sister â€" he knew what he was about to do next was going to make him look like the biggest fool â€" and though he knew there was nothing he could do, he followed his little sister. Aravind walked closer to his sister, and just like that, without spending a thought, he spat on Mani.

A few other children stepped forward and began to spit on the dolphin.

'That's not going to work!' snapped Suresh angrily, 'There's nothing we can do to save him,' he added, turning his back on the siblings.

Two more children stepped forward.

'That's never going to work!' shouted Suresh, his voice stricken with anguish. â€<sup>~</sup>Youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re all mad if you think itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going to work!â€<sup>TM</sup>

A few more children cleared their throats.

Suresh stayed back and watched in silence as one after the other, the children standing around him began to spit on the dolphin.

â€<sup>~</sup>Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not going to work!â€<sup>TM</sup> Suresh protested.

Suresh was the last to join the others.

The children closed their eyes and continued to spit on the dolphin â€" they stood there for minutes, and they stood there till their throats were sore with dryness. The children knew what they were doing was stupid, but they didn't care. Deep inside their hearts they believed that they could spit out a stream of saliva for Mani the dolphin to swim back into the ocean, and so they gave it their all. The children held each other's hands and spat till their mouths were as dry as the sand they stood on.

The children stayed that way for minutes. It had become dark, and the children didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t leave even though they knew it would get them in trouble with their parents. The children were adamant, and soon minutes turned to hours. The poor children were parched, and their throats burned each time they breathed in the salty air.

Meenakshi held onto her brotherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s arm, â€<sup>~</sup>I know itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s going to work,â€<sup>TM</sup> she cried.

Aravind smiled at his sister, and then to his surprise, he felt the warm frothy sensation of a hundred bubbles kissing the inside of his toes.

The children opened their eyes, and were elated to see a flood of saliva dragging Mani back into the sea.

Mani sank into the water like a stone, and then he began to float.

There were those who claimed to have seen Mani resurface and jump acrobatically in the water. And a few children even swore that the jubilant animal showed his rescuers his gratitude by performing some of the most graceful tricks know to his kind. But then there were those who claimed to have seen the dolphin relaxed and belly-up, making no attempt to fight the tide. It was a dark night, and there was no way to say for sure what had truly happened. Perhaps the children really did spit out a river for Mani, or perhaps it had just been the high tide. But what mattered was that the children saw to it that the dolphin was back in the sea.

Aravind carried Meenakshi over his shoulder and sneaked a peek at Jennifer. The fishermanâ€<sup>TM</sup>s daughter approached the two siblings and cleared her throat sheepishly, â€<sup>~</sup>Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s late, and I was wondering if you two could walk me home?â€<sup>TM</sup>

On their way back, Meenakshi tugged on her brotherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hair, â€<sup>~</sup>Do you think Mani will come back?â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t see why not,â€<sup>TM</sup> Aravind replied.

â€<sup>~</sup>I think he will,â€<sup>TM</sup> the little girl added after a while. â€<sup>~</sup>Did I tell you that Mani swam to the shore and splashed water on my face before we left?â€<sup>TM</sup>

Jenifer held Aravindâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hand.

â€<sup>~</sup>Is that so ammani?â€<sup>TM</sup> Aravind wheezed.

â€<sup>~</sup>He did!â€<sup>TM</sup> Meenakshi whispered, â€<sup>~</sup>And then he made an EEeeeee sound.â€<sup>TM</sup>

â€<sup>~</sup>YEEeeeeEE...EEEeeeEE...EeeeEEeee...â€<sup>TM</sup> Meenakshi shrieked with joy.

With only the lights from the stars to guide them, the three children walked home.
