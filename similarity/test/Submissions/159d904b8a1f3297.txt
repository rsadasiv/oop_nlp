The Mother 

Savitri held her breathe as she chewed the fish to prevent its smell from assailing her nostrils. She could not bring herself to throw it down the bin since her mother had taken the trouble to cook it with finely chopped and fried tomatoes, onions and coriander and meticulously measured pinches of *jeera*, *dhania* and red chilli powder. She recalled her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s raised eyebrow when she had tried to concoct excuses against carrying lunch from home and mumbled that she would buy a *thali* from the canteen as she did on most of the days. It was not every day that her mother, stricken with various old age related ailments, could rustle up a meal before she dashed out of the house at 7:30 AM to catch the chartered bus. 

A bearded man, about a decade older than Savitri, appeared across the table, pulled back a green plastic chair, dropped his multi-chambered steel Tiffin box on the seat of another chair with a thud, and called out to the cleaner to wipe off the spilled *dal* from the white table surface. She glanced at her watch. It was 1:10 PM in India; hence 9:40 AM in UK. She could not afford to spend an entire day trying to push down her throat the remaining rice soused with fish gravy. Mr Robert Graves, the programming manager of her client company expected her to start the online demonstration at 10:00 AM sharp. Trashing the contents of the Tiffin box with more than a little sense of guilt, she turned on the tap of the wash basin to rinse her hands, held them under the electronic drier and headed towards the lift. 

Back in her cubicle, positioning the land phone right next to her keyboard, Savitri dialled Mr Grave‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s office number, and navigated to the online meeting site while waiting for him to answer. Then, copying the password from the meeting invite e-mail, she clicked on a dark blue button to join the session. 

‚ÄoeHello.‚Äù She heard her client‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crisp voice at the other end of the line and at the same time noticed the small diamond shaped icon blink beside his name in the chat window, indicating that he had joined the meeting. The session went on for a couple of hours; Savitri logged into various interlinked applications, typed in fresh sets of data, and clicked a number of buttons to demonstrate the outcomes of different operations. 

A feeling of satisfaction crept into Savitri as she clicked the oval green button on her chat window to stop her computer screen from being viewed by Mr Graves, after he had quit the meeting leaving behind words of praise. She rose from her seat and walked towards the balcony without stopping by the pantry. On other days, when she stood against the railing overlooking the street and the lake beyond, her fingers would be curled around the handle of a porcelain cup imprinted with her company logo and filled with steaming coffee from the vending machine. 

Savitri took a deep breath. The golden sunlight drew spines along the curved backs of the waves in the lake water. Squeezed by the swirling frames of the grey clouds, the sky cast itself into various shapes, but stretched uninterrupted over the high-rises in the east. The strip of reddish sunlight from the horizon to the center of the lake reminded her of the concluding pink line that had appeared in the PregaNews kit. She had typed the good news to Rohan instead of calling him as he could have been in a meeting. Despite the nausea pummelling her sense of comfort and the apprehension regarding the new route her life would take, she was swept over by a happiness which knocked at the deepest of her thoughts, like one raps at her friends‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> doors inviting them for a gambol. Her emotions milled around - sometimes bunching up like fresh jasmines and at other moments, detached yet belonging together like the stars in a constellation. 

Savitri recalled the Friday she had been on leave. The fan of the cooler was whirling, emanating a noise which could be best described as a kind of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>mechanical snoring‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. They lied on a floral patterned mattress, their limbs intertwined and eyes closed, although they were very much awake. A wooden plaque with an engraving of Lord Ganesha, which she had gifted him, hung on the whitewashed wall. Rohan had not bothered to buy any furniture for his temporary home. His books and CDs remained stacked against the wall and his laptop held pride of place a couple of feet behind his pillow. 

A heap of crumpled clothes had tumbled out of the inbuilt wall cupboard, when Savitri had  pulled opened its doors for the first time. She had ironed his shirts and trousers, folded and arranged them in neat piles, before putting them back on the shelves. Picking up the knick-knacks strewn across the floor - gifts from his friends including a photo album from his ex-girlfriend, mementoes from his former office colleagues, an amulet from a relative, a matchstick house he had bought at a fair, and tiny stone animals he had carried back from a trip - she had assembled them on top of the cooler; the larger objects behind the smaller ones. 

Savitri had stepped into his kitchen to find the cooking utensils balanced precariously on top of each other and the shelves crammed with mostly empty bottles of sauces, containers of pickles, boxes of biscuits and packets of potato chips. Shifting the plates and bowls to a corner of the floor, she had scrubbed the kitchen platform with lukewarm water stirred with a detergent that smelled of lemon. After scouring the vessels at the sink, she had fitted the differently sized bowls into one another, and placed them next to a can of mustard oil. The plates were made to stand against the wall at the far end of the platform, and the cutlery was sorted into bunches and packed off in separate drawers. She had stowed packets of masala into a cardboard bag procured from his bedroom cupboard, and fastened it to a nail that stuck out from the kitchen shelf. Surveying the marble slab, Savitri felt satisfied that there was now enough space to slice and chop the fruits and vegetables without knocking over anything. 

Revelling in his gleaming kitchen, Rohan had cooked for her garlic chicken - a dish he had mastered, and served it with warm, round *chapattis*. Exhausted after a day packed with activities, which included a trip to a famous 13th century fortress atop a hillock, a visit to a museum with innumerable chambers and never-ending corridors, and a stroll in a Mughal garden dotted with fountains and crisscrossed by canals, both of them had slumped on the mattress, putting to rest memories of being denied a room in a hotel situated in their hometown on grounds of being unmarried. 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to have any morning after pills. It is high time we have a baby,‚Äù she said, fiddling with the sacred chain he wore around his waist. 

He opened his eyes and stroked her face: traversing her forehead, circumscribing her tiny round *bindi*, tracing the ridge of her nose, halting at its shiny tip, skidding down the slope of her upper lip and lingering over the curve of the lower one. ‚ÄoeWhatever you wish,‚Äù he murmured gently, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll marry you within a month if you conceive.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeIf I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, we can wait a year longer for your parents to come around,‚Äù she added, flushed with happiness that her boyfriend had accepted her wish without a fuss. 

Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parents had been delaying their marriage over some illogical pretext or the other. It was obvious that they wanted Savitri to buckle under the tremendous pressure exerted on a woman by her family and society to get married within a certain age, and leave him for a man who could wed her sooner, or they hoped his interest in her would wane over the years so he would call off the relationship eventually. Savitri was not dying to take the nuptial vows but she longed for a child of her own. 

The first thing Savitri had done this morning after arriving at her office was to drop her bag on her desk and rush to the washroom with a little brown paper bag clutched within her trembling fingers. Her face had erupted into pimples the day after returning from Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house. Her limbs had been aching since the following week and the nausea started on the fifteenth day. When four days had passed since the expected date of her periods, she got a married friend to buy her a PregaNews kit. An unmarried woman buying one would have caused a lot of flutter in the medicine shop. 

A single beep in Savitri‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mobile phone announced the entry of a new e-mail. The design for the railway ticket booking system she would develop had been finalized. Hurrying back to her quadrant, she swiped the electronic card dangling down her chest, pushed open the glass door, walked to her cubicle, settled down in her chair and unlocked her desktop. Downloading the design document from the mail, she turned open the cap of the bottle that stood on her desk and took a few sips of water. After going through the specifications and analysing the block diagram, she wrote down a few questions in a notepad. Then she clicked open the office chat window and requested her project lead for clarification of her doubts. Once satisfied with his explanation, she maximized the window of her development tool and proceeded with her coding, occasionally searching through the old folders for a previously written piece of code to check on a particular syntax. 

Savitri lifted her eyes from the screen for a few more sips of water, wondering when Rohan would call. Was their baby a girl or a boy? Whom would the child resemble? Her mind drifted to a video from Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s childhood which he had shown her during a bus trip. He was bawling at the top of his lungs as his mother tried to pull him out of his clothes. Finally succeeding in her endeavour, she cradled infant Rohan in her arms to calm him, and walked to a washroom with sky blue coloured tiles. Bending over a round dark blue tub, the maid dipped her hand in the water to check its warmth and nodded. Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother swiftly shifted him to the maid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arms, applied a drop of shampoo to her palm, rubbed her hands against each other, and ran her fingers through his tiny curls till his mop of dark brown hair was entirely covered with froth. Then she reached for the soap case, lathered the soap, and scrubbed him thoroughly with the help of a brush. When his peach fair skin was glistening with bubbles, she took him from the maid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arms, and lowered him into the tub. Before baby Rohan could part his pink lips to let out a deafening cry, the maid brought within his reach a red toy mug and he grabbed it with both hands smiling through the couple of teeth he had acquired just days ago. With the help of a larger mug, his mother first washed off the shampoo suds from his hair and then the lather from his body. Rohan who had recently learnt to sit with support, was leaning against the tub wall, sucking the handle of the toy mug, and blinking his hazel eyes as the water splashed over him. 

Savitri recalled a photograph from her own childhood, which she had taken out from the thick leather bound family album, scanned and uploaded in Facebook. She was clad in a golden frock that reached up to her knees, her jet black eyes were focused on something outside the range of the photo, and a wide smile almost touched the dimples in her chubby chocolate brown cheeks. She called to mind Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s comment on the photo, when the mobile phone lying between the keyboard and her handbag started to ring and his name flashed on its screen. 

‚ÄoeCan you go to a place where there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no one around?‚Äù he asked. 

‚ÄoeSure,‚Äù Savitri almost leapt from her chair in excitement, but reminded herself that she was not supposed to do so for the next nine months. 

Pacing to the balcony, she found a dozen men sipping coffee and discussing work. She scampered out of it and took the lift to reach the topmost floor. Then she climbed a flight of stairs to the terrace, rested her elbow on the upper edge of the parapet and pressed the mobile phone to her ear. 

‚ÄoeWe can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the baby,‚Äù he said softly. 

‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù the word barely escaped from her lips. The glow faded from her face in an instant, her heart raced and the whishing sound of her breath reached her ears. 

‚ÄoeI can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t marry you now. My mother will become hysterical and my father may have a heart attack,‚Äù he explained. Savitri could feel her dreams being shredded apart like a letter one does not wish anyone to chance upon. 

‚ÄoeYou said you will marry me even if they raise objections and it was oblivious that they would,‚Äù she moaned, crushed under the unfairness of his decision. 

‚ÄoeI will marry you, but not so soon.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeI did not lie to you about not popping the pill. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not exactly a shock for you.‚Äù Savitri‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice was shaking. 

She heard a deep sigh at the other end. 

‚ÄoeThe day we spent in my flat was so beautiful and magical that I had agreed to the impossible,‚Äù he said after a long pause. 

Savitri could not believe her ears but waited for him to continue. 

‚ÄoeIt was my mistake. I will make up for it one day by being a great husband. You will conceive again after our marriage. I will be a great father too. You will see....‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhy can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you marry me now?‚Äù she asked, steadying her voice. 

‚ÄoeAs you know, there are no auspicious dates for marriage in the coming four months,‚Äù he blurted out. 

‚ÄoeWho cares?‚Äù Savitri hissed. 

‚ÄoeMy parents do. They will never accept a marriage solemnized on any random day. Moreover, we have so many relatives that it will take several *lakh *rupees to arrange a wedding reception at such a short notice and invite all of them, and if I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, my parents will lose their face. You know that my father has to pay off his house loan and I have my education loan to settle.‚Äù His words came out fast and he did not pause for breath. 

‚ÄoeYou mean a feast for your relatives is more important than our child. What will they lose if they are not invited to our wedding? Will it affect their career, children, marriage, anything?‚Äù Savitri reasoned though her composure was crumbling. 

‚ÄoeIt will affect my parent‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reputation. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mean to sound harsh but that is more important to me than a child who has not been born,‚Äù Rohan replied, emphasising the last few words. 

The clouds had taken over the sky. She recalled spotting a rainbow from this terrace the day Rohan had called to say that he loved her, and waited with bated breath at the other end of the line to hear her reply. A man squatting at the edge of the lake withdrew his fishing line from the water, a couple cozying up in a bench got to their feet, and the boat riders with their eyes on the bank, furiously paddled their boats churning the water at the bow. 

Savitri slowly climbed down the stairs with her hand on the balustrade. Pressing on the button, she leaned against the wall for support while waiting for the lift. Her eyes fell on the sacred red thread her mother had made her tie around her left wrist to protect her from illnesses and other perils. Inside the elevator, she stared at the grey floor carrying her downwards, backtracking through the ecstasy of wish fulfillment, the nail biting anticipation since the last three weeks, the glimmer of hope when the symptoms started to show, the warm satisfaction of being loved and understood in Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s rented single room flat. 

Once back on the third floor, she lifted her head, straightened her shoulders and marched down the corridor while imagining her colleagues glimpsing her three months old bulge and nudging each other, then glaring at her five months old bump and whispering loud enough for her to hear. At seven months, they would invent flaws in her work; at eight, they would discuss how girls like her are degrading the county‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s culture by aping the West, and finally at nine months, when she would meet the HR to get her maternity leave approved, he would survey her from head to toe as if she were an alien. 

She halted before the door of her quadrant, but turned and walked towards the balcony. It was packed with employees who had gathered to feel the cold wind rush through their shirts and skim across their faces; to watch it pounce on the plants growing along the edge of the lake, toss the water into alligator shaped creases, sweep off the dried leaves lying by the street, and roll the rusted cans belonging to the makeshift shops just outside the office premises. She selected Rohan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s number in her cell phone and clicked. 

‚ÄoeI know you are upset but....‚Äù he began. 

‚ÄoeI am having the baby,‚Äù she declared. The lady standing nearest to her turned to look. 

‚ÄoeNow darling, I have already apologized for my mistake and I have explained to you the reasons why we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t...‚Äù Rohan proceeded in the manner a guardian speaks to his ward. 

‚ÄoeMistake?‚Äù Savitri cut him short. ‚ÄoeAgreeing to have a child and then asking it to be aborted is not the same as scribbling down a wrong information on paper and then removing it with an erasing fluid.‚Äù 

By now, Savitri could feel not one but several gazes in her direction. 

‚ÄoeI don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need to marry you,‚Äù her voice was as cold as the raindrops that lashed at her. She stepped back from the railing as she did not want to risk falling ill. 

‚ÄoeYou want to be an unwed mother when all your unmarried friends still pretend to be virgins?‚Äù he sounded incredulous. ‚ÄoeEven the richest and the most privileged women in our society will not dare to do so. Do you think you are in Europe just because one of your clients is UK based?‚Äù he raised his voice. 

‚ÄoeI know exactly where I am. The law of our land does not discriminate between married and unmarried women, even if our society does. And I am going to use the law against those who dare to harm me or my child,‚Äù she said firmly. A couple of men, who looked younger than her, stopped in the course of lifting their coffee mugs to their lips. 

‚ÄoeWhy is this foetus so important to you? Who will stop us from having children after our marriage? Why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you wait till then since you have already waited so long,‚Äù Rohan showered her with questions. 

‚ÄoeBecause it was not an accidental pregnancy. I have wanted this baby; this baby which is from a particular sperm that you will never release again and an egg which I will never produce again.‚Äù Her confidence grew as her thoughts and the words she chose to articulate them fell into a flow like a tune being composed. 

There was silence at the other end. Some of the people in the balcony shuffled their feet and fidgeted with their mugs. Some others even pricked their ear-holes with their little fingers as if to scrape out the objectionable words like ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>sperm‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>egg‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>. 

‚ÄoeListen, Rohan, I will be a mother in any case. If you go back on your word, the baby won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know you. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s your loss, not mine,‚Äù she spoke loud enough to be heard despite the rumbling among the clouds. The centrally controlled lights in the balcony had been switched on and all eyes were fixed upon her. Since she would face those stares for the rest of her life, it was better that she got used to them from that moment itself. Smoothing a crease on her grey striped formal shirt, she stepped out of the balcony and strode towards her quadrant.
