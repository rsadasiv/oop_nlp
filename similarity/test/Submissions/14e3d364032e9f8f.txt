Bio: I am an anthropologist based in Bangalore, teaching at the Azim Premji University. I finished my PhD at the Department of Anthropology, Yale University last year. I have been a lawyer and legal researcher in a different life. Apart form academic writings on the intimate experiences of capital that are emitted through narrative, I have been a contributor of essays to the 3AM magazine. I edited and contributed to a literary magazine called Quirk at the National Law School of India University. Please find below my short story titled Chowringee. 


Chowringee 

Youth erupted on the crossroad of Chowringee. In keeping with famous movie sequences that portray the urban abyss of Calcutta. Of course smeared with *Marxbadi* stardust of Sankarâ€<sup>TM</sup>s novel. In our days, it was also the place where the world touched down upon the city. Smatterings of the world wars were spoken. There was a sense of joy. Although there was trauma. Internally, from the political agitations against the Raj. And externally, from the tremors of the Great Wars. It was the heels of the war that Anthony arrived in Calcutta. He had lived in Bombay for a few years working with advertising firm. Their office asked him to move to the Calcutta office. He was, like many of my friends, Anglo-Indian. His grandfather was an officer in the British Army, who had served in the north for two decades. A typical story. A branch of family grows up in India, siphoning off of the strand of British blood. 

Jolly good guy this Anthony. 

A head of thick white curls. Jawbones. Things not generally assets of us Bengalis. I was finishing at Presidency then. Someone of my social station studies English. An uncle had promised to get me into this advertising firm. Lloyds  & Co. I wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t going to make very big in there. I lacked zeal. Not that zeal counts for a lot in the advertising world. My friend Shyamol was a mathematics student at Presidency. A couple of years younger than I. Our mothers were cousins. And friends from their Sylhet days. Calcutta came alive amidst the fraternity of Shyamol and Anthony. One was busy imagining social applications of infinity. The other was designing modern households that would please babu pride and aspiration, yet not be too far from tradition. They were both walking around with pens, pencils and bits of paper. We were investing in copious amounts of *cheene badam[1]*. And dreaming about Katherine Hepburn. I was investing in Marilyn also, but wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t admit it to them. Marilyn was too much of a pop princess. Something crass about her. They would say. 

Anthony married Srilatha. A Bharatnatyam dancer. She was beautiful like in year-end calendar photos. Her eyes were always dramatically painted. They moved to the south for her dancing career. The Naxal trouble began. Two of my cousins were missing. The firmâ€<sup>TM</sup>s business was shaky. They were asking me to move to Bombay but I was hesitant. Shyamol moved to Balliol College for higher studies in number theory. It was the city and me. Ma asked me to get married. She found eligible women and asked them to come home for tea to engineer casual chitchat with me. In todayâ€<sup>TM</sup>s language, it would be called a date. I was unhappy with Shyamolâ€<sup>TM</sup>s decision. I liked to think of him as starkly alone, autonomous, free of the petty concerns of the world, free of ambition. But even he trotted behind a PhD. I was offended that the world did not care about my fantasies. I, the average copy-editor. 

I married eventually. A woman who held a college lecturerâ€<sup>TM</sup>s position. In Linguistics. When Ma described her, I had thought someone of that description should have short hair and glasses and wear a flannel skirt. But she wore a cotton sari and wore her hair in a bun. And wore glasses. She was taller than me by an inch. We got along. Had a son. Who went on to become a mechanical engineer and settle in Hyderabad. The usual. Ma grew old and died of a stroke. The marble staircase that led to her bedroom was laden with discarded furniture. It became a blocked path to a road that existed but one had stopped taking it. The force of convention had feebled. Calcutta had moved into a Communist era. Red flags spoke with confidence on our streets. Congress and Communist fellows came to blows often. In the rural areas, the Congress fellows didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t stand a chance, our maid Kamala used to say. There were strikes. Our firm had mostly shifted its important business to Bombay. The move to a larger, more dynamic city was an attractive option for advertising professionals. I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to leave our house on Kedar Mohan Ray Street. My wife wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t inhospitable to the idea of Bombay. She felt education options might be better in Bombay. Board exams and college exams were often sabotaged by politics. I am no card-carrying Marxist romantic. But the problems of the city didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t seem enough reason for me to want to leave it. These days, a lot of Indians living in western countries write about being Indian and living away from India. The papers review them extensively. The diaspora novel, they say. I had no wish to be diaspora. It seemed like living life in suspended animation. Maybe I was old-fashioned. 

I moved though. My wife and I. To Toronto for two years. I had a fellowship in media studies. Toronto was lovely. Many people were living the diaspora life there. I spent a lot of my energy explaining to them that I was no diaspora. I was just spending an extended holiday abroad. We ate good food. I wrote some papers and social impact of advertising. We visited friends and relatives in North America. I had heard that Shyamol had moved to Canada, but wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t sure where. The smells of Calcutta began to feel like feathers of nostalgia in Toronto. A slow city. One that has trouble keeping up with the world. Race and ethnicity merged in dance of neons and colors on Toronto streets. There were protest marches and carnivals. Bengal and its small-minded pride and hurt seemed too trivial. Where was an argument about multiculturalism in Calcutta coffeehouses? It was all so small. 

As small as I felt standing by Shyamolâ€<sup>TM</sup>s grave. Shyamol was buried in Toronto. My wife found out from family networks. She took me to the cemetery. I felt like eating roasted peanuts and spreading the ribbed shells on the grass. Somewhere the evening sun must have been floating on Chowringee dust.
