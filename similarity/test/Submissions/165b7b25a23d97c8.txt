*After Hours* 


It had been a shit week. The prawns I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d just ordered were smaller than my little finger. Washing the sting off my tongue with too-sweet port wine, I asked for the cheque and listlessly looked around the restaurant. It was empty but for the stoic woman behind the bar who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d refused to change the music. 

‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Careless Whisper‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> sliced through my migraine, only to bring to my notice the undercooked meat. 

At this point, I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even pretend that life was a catalogue of illusions long enough to get through dinner. 

With my tired eyes, deadbeat jacket and paperbacks in my bag, I could almost pass off as Kerouac except I was too middle class to even afford a real drinking problem.

The bill broke my stream of consciousness ‚Ä" that was eagerly twirling around the various ways I would bend the limbs of an imaginary Russian girlfriend ‚Ä" two grand spent on another empty evening with bad lighting and a smoky dining area. Smelling of cigarettes and disappointment, I decided to skip calling a cab and walk back to my apartment ‚Ä" anything to prolong reaching the deafening silence of my room and the two-week old omelet still probably stuck to the floor. 

This is when I saw her, standing by the side of the road ‚Ä" almost inviting in her hostility. I could see her beautiful Asian eyes and the tip of her nose turned red from the cold. Did she know she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d just managed to punch a hole through to my heart in a way that made my knees go weak and I wondered if I said to her that I wanted her, would her eyebrows furrow in distaste and her lips purse themselves into a single, unbending line and if she would look at me with her steady eyes and say, ‚Äoe*so*?‚Äù

You see, it had all started with one meeting. This Monday was just like any other Monday. I had been successfully avoiding the boss, the coffee tasted like it had real milk in it ‚Ä" more than I could‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve possibly expected from my day. 

I was trudging along, feeling suitably happy with my lack of productivity when he started clicking his tongue at me. He had this habit; his brown eyes narrowed, stubby fingers clicking away at his keyboard. Sometimes, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d stare at him without really looking or glance at him from the corner of my eye. All my delusions of indifference disappeared faster than my smug smile did when he called me over. 

The next fifteen minutes are still slightly hazy in my memory. Or, maybe it was the cheap store-bought port wine masquerading as something meant for important dinners. 

Either way, I walked over to his desk to listen to the latest diatribe he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d planned on throwing my way. I was rudely interrupted from my reverie, as I was watching his mouth contort into grotesque forms, by the colour of his shoes. Electric blue. I wondered what sort of sartorial arrogance had made him decide on that colour in the morning. What part of him truly believed that this would be the colour to make a winning statement on a Monday? Eyes travelling up to his t-shirt with the words ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Fuck You If You Think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m A Freak‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> emblazoned across his chest in willful ignorance and I felt a wave of nausea envelope me. 

Now, the thing with nausea ‚Ä" when it comes to me in unexpected waves ‚Ä" is that it clouds all my sense of judgment. I stared into his laptop screen till the words seem to melt right off it. I leaned forward with heartbreaking confidence and bent the top half away from its base, till it snapped right off the edges, blazing a trail for the inevitable. I took the screen off and crushed it under my weather beaten boots till it unwittingly splintered into tiny pieces, Chet Baker‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>My Funny Valentine‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> playing in the background of my consciousness till somebody gasped. 

A silly, unforgivable gesture of little consequence. I stood up without a word and walked right out of the office, and in to a glaring, bright sun.

Four days had gone by since I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d seen the sunlight. My room was now perennially draped in the arbitrary crimson glow of my lamp that gave me enough light to navigate the mauve-lit darkness of my room. The moon slowly crept up behind the tree, completely captivating me with its sobering presence and just as suddenly disappeared into the deepest recesses of the clouds. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d negotiated myself a space on my bed that would leave me alone with my thoughts and even though I could hear the tinkering go on outside, I wanted to be disconnected. Left to the welcoming silence. 

Sometimes, if I could completely hold my breath for a while, I could hear the hastily muffled gasps of pleasure escaping from the room next door, or if I tilted my head slightly closer to the window, I could almost hear the wind quietly rustle through the dead leaves on the ground. 

My conversation was limited to asking the maid to throw out the dead rat found inside my bed ‚Ä" the stink slowly but surely seeping into my nostrils. Initially, it killed my appetite but slowly I found comfort in its presence. 

The removal of the rat seemed like a precursor to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>getting on with it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> ‚Ä" the gentle but meaningful nudge to do something with my life. Sometimes, a friend dropped by with inconsequential news and a few cold pints of beer. I sipped the beer slowly, letting each drop soothe my throat; I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d gotten used to not talking. Suddenly, everybody wanted to be around me. 

Earlier, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d spent Saturday evenings chewing cold baked beans without really tasting them, trying to unsuccessfully wash the taste of loneliness down with processed orange juice while reading Kafka fifth time in a row. 

Sometimes, on empty evenings, I would pretend there was an imaginary robber in my room. Sometimes, I would threaten him with my shoe, sometimes offer him a cold glass of water, sometimes we even had conversations by my bedside. So, as it goes without saying, this newfound popularity, while satisfying a certain elementary need, irked me. 

What also irked me was how suddenly, I had so much time on my hands to indulge the whims of women I was bringing home. One wanted to adjust the room‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s temperature because she had slow blood circulation, another had trouble sharing my modest bed so expected me to take the floor, the multitude of stale take-aways mixed with the smell seeping out of the bathroom stall was enough by the middle of the week to turn any self-respecting woman away. 

This particularly feisty one had a habit of thinking out loud, breaking my concentration focussed on matching my socks. Immune to my irritability, she had an unsaid attraction about her. Maybe she was unaware of how her eyes turned beady when she was trying to concentrate or how her mouth curved downwards like she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t smile enough or how she had this fascinating habit of playing with her hair like a schoolgirl. It was strangely inviting because for all her unattractiveness, she spoke to me like she owned me. 

That lasted all of twenty hours. When she was finally leaving, she told me she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d left little notes scribbled with her musings all over my room. All I had to do was hunt for them. That grated on my nerves in a way that made me want to pack my belongings and move to another city but I resisted from a veiled jibe and gave her a quick peck on her cheek. 

She was awkward with physical affection in the exact same way I was. Somehow, the joints and sockets of our limbs would find a way to adjust themselves around each other without leaving much room for intimacy - I preferred it that way.

By the fifth day, the crowd of voices had dwindled and now I could tell exactly what time of the day it was by glancing at the shadow the sun cast on the opposite building. 

One morning, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d woken up to the refrigerator trying to gently wake me up and coax me into a conversation. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s around the time I decided that maybe it was time to take it easy on the substances. I also had a little funeral for my phone. A small wooden box lined with black velvet that a girl had left behind, turned into the unsuspecting coffin where I buried it, dropping mud onto it slowly, till it brimmed to the top and fell over onto my desk. Then, I threw it out of my eighth storey-window. I left the specks of mud on my desk, though. 

For the first time ever, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d begun adding small touches of subtle beauty to my room. Fluffing my pillow right before I could sink myself into it, leaving sheets unmade after sex to lend it a sense of familiarity, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d gotten accustomed to whetting and manipulating time and space. 

*** 

It was while smoking that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d spotted her. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lit a cigarette just as I had, and for the briefest moment the flame lit up her face and blood rushed to my face. Suddenly, I felt like someone important again. I knew I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have the robber come visit me if I was to have her back home. There was something so achingly beautiful about her fragile fingers that held the cigarette squarely at the end. 

I watched her glance around aimlessly; a weather beaten coat and a paperback in hand. She tugged at the fraying cuffs of the coat and pulled her bag of take-away closer to her ‚Ä" there was a vacancy in her eyes I felt myself wanting to fill up. With all my contradictions and convictions, all my seasons and lack of sunshine. 

I imagined us with our villa by the beach, a daughter with limbs turned brown from the ocean sun filling our mornings up with chatter and our nights up with the deep, gentle breathing of slumber ‚Ä" the kind that only the innocent can afford. 

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d gotten used to the solitude of my room, comforting in its persistence but I could see myself getting used to her morning breath similarly too. I held my breath longer than a prostitute can afford to have an orgasm, while she smoked the last few drags of her cigarette. 

We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d watch banned erotica in our bedroom and make love to Chet Baker. Read out our favourite paperbacks on rainy afternoons and she would puncture my silences, silences as nasty as a hangover you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t shake off, with her stories and her puzzle pieces. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d ask me about my mother and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d ask her about her photographs and our love would never feel as stagnating as if we were only convincing ourselves of it. We would spread our souls out for each other like an ocean full of stars. 

She would cry for me on the kitchen floor and I knew ‚Ä" with the same certainty that I knew I loved her - I had a closet full of holocaust victims to return to and soon she would begin writing hate poems in her head while grilling venom for breakfast and no matter how much I travelled down roads running into the tummies of Africa, I knew I was a deranged prisoner of my own direction. 

*** 

I could see her beautiful Asian eyes grow haggard with routine as she would grow to depend on my postcards and she would soon start humming to herself as the hummingbirds stopped visiting our backyard and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll still be a man with secrets and a bullet and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll grow a garden over where I bury her with nobody but the dead to feed. But now, I know I must take my leave. 

After hours tonight, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lay out all the cushions for her in all the right places.
