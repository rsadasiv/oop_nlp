Bio: I work as an editor with a publishing house. I love to eat, chat and make friends. What I superbly like is the wind in my hair. The touch of blowing wind is all I need to call a day awesome. Here's my story...I mean Rukaiya's story. 

*The lost world of Alice in Abadghar* 

It was Thursday, yet there were no flowers laid outside the *dargah* that day. It had rained but it did not feel like one of those days when water droplets tickled everything they touched. It had been pouring for days, yet everything felt baked in soil. Rukaiya realized a week had passed by ever since she had taken a bath. But then you could not blame her. She was busy looking for pieces of herself in Munawar Abad, a small town near Srinagar. 

Rukaiya had spent days looking for an unfinished book her father bought her from Lal Chowk. She was restless to know what happened after the Duchess orders Alice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s execution. She knew she was hoping against hope given the fact that the overflowing river Jhelum had drowned every nook of her town. Her house had been washed away in the floods. Winters were close. The dilapidated wooden house that she once called home was now flattened into a square piece of land. The *dargah* that still stood next to her house had been her only companion for sometime. No, wait. Hope and curiosity were also her housemates in these days when her life seemed to have slipped into deep waters. 

There were two things that Rukaiya had no patience with: Hunger and curiosity. For the moment, both troubled her. A glass of milk and some news on Alice‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fate would have soothed her nerves. In fact, there was a great deal that she wanted to know. Where were her friends and family? Why the night of September 3rd changed everything. It had rained so many times, why did it become so lethal this time. She was giving her classic head massage to *ammi* when it first thundered so hard that the bottle of walnut oil she carefully clutched in her hands slipped away. She could still feel the unbearable greasiness of that moment. ‚ÄoeAllah bachaye‚Äù, *ammi* had said, as she jumped from the *diwan* to look outside. Her father had been away to Delhi to sell carpets. Like every year, he had left in the beginning of September and was only to return in February. So, it was she who had to look for *ammi*. 

She tried to recollect. Aha! She must be stuck in Lal Chowk with Farhana‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s *ammi*. But, first she had to look for the lost world of Alice somewhere nearby. Rukaiya was living it up in Wonderland when suddenly news broke that water had now reached above the first floor of her wooden house. What was she to do; *ammi *had already been stuck in Srinagar for two days. The *maulvi* who lived inside the *dargah* had come to her rescue. He had given her an old cot and some warm clothes. They, along with a few others, were putting up on the rooftop of the shrine, which was taller than most of the nearby buildings (whatever remained of the these). It was still waterlogged everywhere. With no sight of *ammi* and *abba* anywhere, the odds were against her. But she knew she must leave now or the Ducchess would behead Alice!
