Sharmaji 

by 

Parag Chitnis 

The story began with a vessel filled with boiling milk. Two sweaty hands moved to grab a plastic sugar box with a pink coloured lid. The *Chaiwala* added sugar in the boiling milk and replaced the pink lid. Then he picked up another plastic box with the same coloured lid. It had tea powder mixed with some *masala*. Who knows what that *masala* was? The *Chaiwala* counted as he added the tea powder in the boiling milk spoon by spoon. The aroma of the *masala* filled in the cold evening air. Sharma*ji* loves this aroma. Any tea-lover will love it. This aroma- like a soup before a meal- creates, if there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s something called, *appetite for tea*. Then the *Chaiwala* took a long spoon and started to stir the milk. The aroma became dense as sugar, tea powder, and the *masala* mixed with the boiling milk. Now, Sharma*ji* couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait more for his tea. But, what else could he do? He had to wait. The *Chaiwala* continued to stir for what seemed like hours to Sharma*ji*. Sharma*ji* was like a child watching his mom making his favourite dish. Why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I myself go inside the milk and boil it quickly? Sharma*ji* must have thought. No, you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t call it milk anymore. It had become tea now. Sharma*ji* knew it the moment the *Chaiwala* picked up a cloth to get the vessel down from the stove. Then he filtered the tea into another vessel. Oh, the aroma! Sharma*ji *got lost in that aroma and came back to reality only when the *Chaiwala* had brought him his glass filled with hot tea. He missed seeing the *Chaiwala* pouring tea in other glasses which he then handed to the people sitting next to Sharma*ji*. Anyways, Sharma*ji* was trying to ignore those people. 

Pandey*ji*, who was sitting next to Sharma*ji*, continued to talk in excitement and Sharma*ji* continued to ignore him. What else could Sharma *ji* do? Sachin had got out on duck today. Sharma*ji* heard Pandey*ji* describing the four Dhoni had hit to finish the match. Sharma*ji* doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t like Dhoni. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Tendulkar fan. He had little interest in knowing how Dhoni saved the match. Only if Sachin had played well, Sharma*ji* would have described each of his shot- just like Pandey*ji* was describing Dhoni‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s- and tell Pandey*ji *and others that we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t win any game without Sachin. Oh, God! Sharma*ji* missed those days.  It had been a while since Sachin had lost his form and Sharma*ji* had lost his interest in sitting with his neighbours for the evening tea and discussing random topics. It seemed just like yesterday when Sharma*ji* had spilled hot tea on his hand while describing how Sachin had scored a double century. He remembered a few more of Sachin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s good innings and Pandey*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice ceased to exist for him. 

The glass that Sharma*ji *was holding was thick and had tea till its top. He lifted the glass carefully to his lips and took a sip. Ahh! Hot *masala* tea in a cold evening like this! Nothing else can refresh Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mood after such a terrible performance by Sachin. He felt the hot tea flowing down his throat and then sudden hotness in his stomach. 

Trying to avoid eyes of his neighbours, Sharma*ji* turned his face to another side. He saw known people enjoying their *masala* tea and talking. Mostly about the match. Just like him, everyone else was also watching the match in their offices. Some say their bosses join them too for cricket matches. But Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boss isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t one of them. His boss has a typical bossy nature. Always wears a suit and a tie. Never satisfied with Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s or his colleagues‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> work. Occasionally smiles and rarely praises. No doubt Sharma*ji* hates his boss. 

Then Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes caught a new face. That was of a child not more than ten. He wore a dull grey shirt and a half-pants which could not hide the injury on his left knee. No, the shirt wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dull grey. It must have been white when bought. Or maybe the boy had picked it up when someone had thrown it away. Who was this boy? He went towards one of the men and put his hand forward as if he was asking something. He said something but Sharma *ji* couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear. He was too far. The man said nothing but signalled the boy to go away. And then the boy went to another man. Was he a beggar? Sharma*ji* thought so. But he hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen him there earlier. Then it popped up in Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind. There was some construction work going on nearby. This must be some worker‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s child. He might have wanted to buy some candy or something and his parents wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have given him money. Or maybe he hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t asked them. Just come out on the road and beg for it. Someone might give. Sharma*ji* found this very fascinating. How can someone just go to a stranger and ask for money? Sharma*ji* even struggles to ask for holidays to his boss whom he knows well. This boy was something new for him. 

This boy reminded him of the story Mishra*ji* from his office had told him. Last year, Mishra*ji* had gone to Banaras with his wife and his mother-in-law. Visiting Banaras was Mishra*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother-in-law‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wish. She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d said she could die peacefully after that. They found a young boy- just like this one- on the streets of Banaras who hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t eaten for two days. Mishra*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother-in-law felt pity for him. So Mishra*ji* fed the boy well and gave him good clothes. Mishra*ji* had recalled this episode in front of all the office colleagues with pride. Even their boss had praised Mishra*ji*, though only in one line while smoothening his tie. Sharma*ji* remembered how Gupta madam- a young colleague in his office- had smiled to show her teeth braces as Mishra*ji* told this story. Sharma*ji* had never told such an episode. He never had one to tell. 

The boy in front of him was such an episode. Sharma*ji* finished his tea quickly and got up. He paid the money for tea and walked towards the boy before anyone else could notice. The boy noticed him even before he reached him. He looked hopefully at him and put his hand forward. When Sharma*ji* was near to him, he murmured something but Sharma*ji* couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand it. ‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù He asked. 

‚ÄoeI haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t eaten since morning. Please give me some money.‚Äù The boy said. 

‚ÄoeWhere‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re your parents?‚Äù Sharma*ji* asked curiously. 

The boy shook his head and said, ‚ÄoePlease give me some money. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m hungry.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeCome with me to my house. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll give you food.‚Äù Sharma*ji* offered him. The boy was startled with this offer. Who would expect such an offer when asked only for few pennies? Sharma*ji* liked the surprised expression on the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face. Why wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t he? He was the reason for that surprise. 

‚ÄoeCome on!‚Äù Sharma*ji* insisted putting his hand on the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back, ‚ÄoeYou like cream biscuits?‚Äù 

The boy nodded keeping his eyes fixed on Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smiling face. What was he suspecting behind that face? Maybe a trap. Or a kind hearted man? How could the boy decide? 

‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve a whole packet of cream biscuits,‚Äù Sharma*ji* said as if he was telling that he had 32 inches TV set. 

Considering the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s half smile as yes, Sharma*ji* started walking towards his house. The boy, somewhat pushed by Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand on his back, walked beside him. 

‚ÄoeCome, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry!‚Äù, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve food for you. Cream biscuits and chocolates too.‚Äù, ‚ÄoeYou drink tea? Or Bournvita?‚Äù, ‚ÄoeThat apartment. Not very far na?‚Äù, ‚ÄoeFourth floor. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve elevator. No need to climb up the stairs.‚Äù Sharma*ji* played with different words till they reached the house. He didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want the boy to change his mind. After all, you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always get a chance to help others and feel proud about that. Sharma*ji* knows that there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re only a few moments for which people remember you. This was one of such moment for him. The moment for which Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s boss would praise him and Gupta madam would smile showing her teeth braces. 

Sharma*ji* rang the bell of his house. Still keeping one hand on the boy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back he waited looking at the wooden door. Then he looked down at the boy. The boy stared back at him. Sharma*ji* smiled. The boy smiled back. 

Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife opened the door. 

‚ÄoeLook, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s with me!‚Äù Sharma*ji* said. Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife was surprised to look at the beggar boy. 

‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù She said. 

‚ÄoeThis is‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄoeRaju,‚Äù The boy said. 

‚ÄoeYes, Raju,‚Äù Sharma*ji* continued, ‚ÄoeCome inside Raju.‚Äù 

The boy followed Sharma*ji* into the house. 

‚ÄoeGet some water for us,‚Äù Sharma*ji *said to his wife. 

Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife was shocked with all this. Sharma*ji* never brings their neighbours to home after the evening tea except for a few occasions. Three months back he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d brought Pandey*ji* with him to show him the new sofa set they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d bought. And six months before that when they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d put on the new carpet on the floor. But this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t any of such occasion to have guests. And this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the proper guest for any occasion. 

‚ÄoeCome inside for a moment.‚Äù Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife murmured in Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ear and went inside. 

Sharma*ji* looked at the boy who was looking around the house while scratching near the injury on his left knee. Sharma*ji* smiled and asked, ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice na?‚Äù 

The boy took a second to understand what Sharma*ji* was asking. He nodded in response without uttering any word. Sharma*ji* was about to ask him to sit but then stopped and said, ‚ÄoeYou wait here. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be back in a minute.‚Äù 

The boy nodded and watched as Sharma*ji* walked towards the kitchen. 

In the kitchen, where the boy couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see from the hall, Sharma*ji* asked his wife, ‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat?‚Äù Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife replied in an angry tone, ‚ÄoeWho‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that boy? And what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s he doing in my house?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeOh come on!‚Äù Sharma*ji* tried to convince his wife, ‚ÄoeHe just asked for money to buy food. I brought him home. Give him something. Maybe a glass of milk and biscuits. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWho is he but?‚Äù Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife tried to keep her voice low. 

‚ÄoeWhy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that important?‚Äù Sharma*ji* asked, ‚ÄoeJust give him something to eat.‚Äù 

Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife exhaled heavily. Her angry eyes were focused on Sharma*ji* and her mouth was tight shut. Sharma*ji* stared back at her and said, ‚ÄoeWhat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the big deal?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeNo, nothing. Not a big deal.‚Äù Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife said taking out a metal glass from a drawer. She filled it with water, ‚ÄoeHe can also have dinner with us if you say,‚Äù she continued in a sarcastic tone, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll cook for him too. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a chef of your house, right? You can bring anyone here and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll cook for them without any complaints. First, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve to cook for your parents and now for this beggar. God knows whom you will bring tomorrow!‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWhat does this have to do with my parents?‚Äù Sharma*ji* asked. 

Then she exhaled heavily again, trying to throw away the anger, and wore a smile on her face as she walked out into the hall to hand the water glass over to the boy. Sharma*ji* didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to talk to his wife further. So he followed her with a smiling face. Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife turned, gave a sharp look at Sharma*ji* and walked back in the kitchen. 

It was too early to start the preparation for dinner. So Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife had nothing to do. Usually, she would sit on the sofa and watch TV but as Sharma*ji* and his new guest were in the hall, she came back to the kitchen. She took out a round plate from the drawer. She put some *Chana dal* in it and started to look for pebbles or something non-edible in it. 

After some time, Sharma*ji* came into the kitchen and said, ‚ÄoeRaju has gone. I gave him some money to buy biscuits.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeGood.‚Äù Sharma*ji*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s wife said in frustrated tone without lifting up her head from *Chana dal*. 

Sharma*ji* has never been able to understand his wife‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mood. She was angry when the boy was there and now when he was gone, she was still angry. Sharma *ji* had no solution for this. He came out in the hall and sat on the sofa picking up the newspaper which he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d read in the morning. He started to speculate tomorrow‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s newspaper. Surely, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be flooded with praises for Dhoni. Everyone would be talking about how Dhoni saved us and all that. He hoped for nobody to criticize Sachin for his poor performance. He put the paper down. There wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t anything good in that. Then he picked up his mobile phone and dialled a number. He peeped into the kitchen as he heard the bell ringing on the other side of the phone. His wife was still busy with her *Chana dal*. 

‚ÄoeHey, mom. How‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re you doing?‚Äù Sharma*ji* said on the phone, ‚ÄoeWhen are you coming to stay with us?‚Äù
