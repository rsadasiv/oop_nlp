Soorpanakha Remembers 

Word Coumt : 3861 

An eternity is a long time to be punished for lusting after a married man. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not just the time span. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also the weariness of the endless travel- over lands and between eras. And the difficulty of dealing with the constant resentment I feel for the same man because he did avenge himself by destroying almost all of my clan. Top this off with the guilt, not of the lusting, how could you think that, but of the.... No, wait- before we get to that, let me tell you who I am. 

I am Soorpanakha. Yes, the very same- the sister of Ravana, widow of Dhutshabhudhdhi, daughter of‚Ä¶never mind, all that stuff about me is out there; just Google it. Please, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be tedious. Of course I know about computers and stuff, I have been around for an eternity, remember? When a woman is going to be around forever and can do nothing except move around in space and time, watching the world becomes the only way of passing time. You watch, you learn and you reflect. You reflect and you feel remorse‚Ä¶ later, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s for later. 

Back to me. All that about me being an ugly crone? Not true. That Kamban dude got it right. Beautiful, sensuous, fish-eyed-that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s me. Take after my mum, I do. In more ways than one, apparently, he‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶ he. Only, she got her man. 

Now, that we are talking about men, let me tell you about mine. . Wait, not the one I wanted. The one I landed up with. Let me get it off my chest or what is left of it. Oh, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t worry about *that* story. All in good time. First, more about my husband-Dhutshabhudhdhi. He was an okay bloke, I guess. Let me stay on at my bro‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s palace. Trouble was, he stayed on too. Or, it turned out to be Trouble, because he decided that he ought to be the king. Went off and indulged in political intrigue and all that. Ravana discovered it and didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t quite take to the idea. Ravana did, well, what any frightened king would do- killed my husband. I privately thought it was pretty unsporting of Big Brother, considering that he usurped the throne from our half-brother Kubera. If you are thinking that this is not a pleasant family, let me assure you- you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know the half of it.  When you think of what my mama did or her folks,,, ,let that be, too long ago. 

Back to me. Ravana was quite decent to me. Let me live on his palace on my terms, gave me the freedom to roam about the forest  unescorted, which in those days was a pretty big deal for a woman and I could also come and go as I pleased. Know what? I think he was fond of me. 

Did I have kids? Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know. I have creased my forehead until I have gone cross-eyed but I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember. I remember only the bad bits, part of the punishment or curse or whatever.  Worse, every time I remember, I relive it. Some days, the pain get so bad, I tremble, weep and howl. Of course you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve heard me. But you would prefer to think it was the wind or the thunder or the earth. Not that I blame you. You can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see me. Nobody can. Part of the good ol‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> punishment. 

So what do I remember? Hard to say. I know about my family history; I seem to remember what I learnt as a kid. But with my family it would be a relief to forget. That is probably why I am allowed to remember. The guys in justice are so holier-than-thou.  Let her remember forever the evil ways of her family and suffer, is probably what they said in their sepulcher tones. Well, they got their wish. My wedding, Dhusht, the early court are but watery images that quiver and seem on the verge of vanishing. 

But my clear memory starts from Ram and ironically, that is my happiest memory. Ah, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s begun to whirl, the floor beneath me and the walls around. Part of my punishment , you see. I remember , constantly and when I remember, I relive- and not just in my mind, but actually physically revisit the scenes of my, er, crime. That means I am forced to feel, again and again, the pain of the humiliation, the anguish of the sorrow and the agony of my remorse. Yeah remorse and guilt. Follow my tale and you will see. 

But now, I am back  at forest where I first saw  him , where in some ways my story actually begins. 

It never fails to stun me- the stream, the trees, the flowers in bloom, the butterflies and the birds. Is it really spring? Who knows? Never kept track of the seasons. He probably created this magical spot to keep that woman happy. Would do anything for her. Or so I thought then. But turned out otherwise, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it? 

However, I knew none of it then. So here I am feeling the old pure exhilaration, standing at the clearing in the forest. The air is crisp and the sky is blue and all that crap. I see him and I fall in lust. 

He is no hunk I admit. and that blue skin is not helping him any. I have seen better since- like that George guy across the seas in that far away land, the one with a cleft in the chin or closer home , that other guy with dimples and an amazing butt, not too far from Rama‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s chithrakut.. But I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know about these guys yet, remember? The only men I have, to compare him with are my bros. One of them has ten heads, the other I have seen either sleeping or eating ‚Ä" you get the picture? As for Vibhishana, the only thing that registered was his stern disapproval.  Now here is this man with a strong supple body, sculpted face and clear eyes. More, there is a radiance emanating from him, something I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t recognize at once but later realize it as purity. That is a quality I never seen before, ever and is my reaction a surprise?  You bet my sharp nails, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not! 

I want this man and I know what to do to get him. I pause to check my reflection in the stream- hair in place, no blemish on face and sari gracefully draped. I walk slowly around the stream to where he stands, making my anklets tinkle softly. He has heard me, I know he has. He turns and eyes meet. His cool questioning look is a bit discouraging but I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get to be a demon by letting small things like cool looks stop me. So I step closer and say, making sure my voice is husky, 

‚ÄùI am Soorpanakha, sister of the mighty Ravana.‚Äù I pause to let the words sink in. Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s face it, most men are frightened of Big Bro and I would be foolish not use his clout when it suits me. 

I look away demurely and then back at him, making sure I am glancing at a spot little below his eyes. It won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pay to meet his eye and send out a signal of being a bold woman. I continue in the same husky tone, ‚ÄoeI desire to be your wife. Will you marry me?‚Äù 

He smiles. Actually smiles and his eyes take on a greater shine. I swallow, falling deeper in desire. 

‚ÄoeI am sorry, dear maiden, but I am a married man and I have vowed to be faithful to my wife.‚Äù 

A courteous gentleman! I am more than ever determined to have him. But his next words makes me flush in anger. 

‚ÄoeBut my brother there, Lakshmana might be agreeable to your proposal.‚Äù 

How dare he? What does he think, that I, Soorpanakha, a princess, sister of Ravana, am available for any male that comes along? Anger rises in me and I see red. Then disaster happens. 

What can I say? When we demons get angry we do foolish things. One thing leads to another and I get the stupid idea that if I killed Sita, who wanders out to see what the noise is all about, I might get Rama. Being a demon with a partiality to human flesh, I decide to eat her. Two birds with a stone, get it? 

Rama does not even bat his eye-lid when Lakshmana charges in and before I know it; gone are my nose, ears and my breasts. The sword slices deeply and I watch the blood flow down to the ground and mix with the earth. My howl is stolen by the wind as the forest disappears and I come back to this suspended space above the earth that I have been living in for a long time now. 

The hurt, even now, is real and I massage my chest. I am a demon, and like any demon worth her raw flesh, I can take on any form I choose. I still go about as the fish-eyed one but I know that the real me is a diminished, disfigured form. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind the ears, never missed my nose but my breasts! The symbol of my femininity, the root of motherhood, the primeval source of all nurturing. They took that away from me and reduced me to becoming half-a- woman. Rama said it is dishonorable to kill a woman but I suppose it is noble to mutilate and humiliate one. They should know, after all they were noble kings. 

I want to forget this ache and I wander about my house. Actually it is not a house; it is a building that resembles the palace of my childhood. But a palace implies a people to rule and kingdom and I have neither. I could call it abode but that would be the kind of thing Rama would call his dwelling place and I have no claim to or illusions of divinity. There is a word I have been hearing recently and often- living space and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the word I am going to use. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s bit odd, my living space. It hovers about in mid-air, among the clouds, and below is the land of my birth. Everywhere I look every time I do, see it.  I am never allowed to forget. Not even for micro-second. When the powers above think up of punishments, you have to admit, they are very thorough. 

The pain melts away slowly but the burden of the guilt hangs heavy. As it has for many thousand years now. I have tried everything for it. Even Guilt management. When I heard about it first, I was excited and hopeful  and off I went off seeking help from the one I thought who might be an expert; he ought to have oodles of it. Or so I thought. 

The person I went off to see was Rama. I thought, one valiant monkey killed in stealth, one war that killed hundreds of innocents and destroyed beautiful land destroyed, and one innocent, very pregnant wife abandoned. The icing on the cake- his final callous refusal to take her back even in the end. An ideal candidate for an anguished soul. Or so I thought . 

No , I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take you there. It is not a memory I am allowed to visit. So I will just have to tell you. Like a story. This was while the twins were being taken back to Ajodhya. I was still alive. Vibhishna was the King  but my privileges were not taken away.  I could come and go as I pleased, whereever I wanted. In the forest that is. So I caught Rama on his way back, before he left the forest and out of my grasp. 

He was startled to see me. Lakshmana drew his sword immediately. No surprises there; needs lessons in anger management, that one. 

‚ÄoeI come in peace.‚Äù I said the minute I revealed myself even before I reached the chariot. I had no desire to lose more body parts, thank you very much. 

Rama held up his hand to stem any attack , I presume from his side. It was obvious I was helpless. 

‚ÄoeGreetings, sister,‚Äù 

I was not the only one who had to hurriedly smother a snort then. It was probably the only time Lakshmana and I were ever in agreement. 

I bowed and said, ‚ÄoeI seek answers.‚Äù 

He nodded and made a gesture that seemed to ask me to get on with it. He probably knew what I wanted, seeing he was god and all. 

‚ÄoeThe guilt‚Äù I blurted out, all my practiced speeches leading up to it ,vanishing into the undergrowth. ‚ÄoeOf the war, of the death of my brothers, of my nephews, my clan, my people. I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Ä¶.‚Äù 

I looked down at my feet, unable to finish. Then I looked up again. 

Rama nodded. I guess he understood. 

‚ÄoePerhaps you were not responsible. Perhaps it was meant to be. Maybe you were only an instrument. If not you, then someone else would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve brought it about. Perhaps they were events whose time had come.‚Äù 

My jaw all but dropped. What a cop out! 

‚ÄoeIs that what you tell yourself when you see your motherless children?‚Äù 

I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t intend to ask him this. I was going to be all humble and supplicating. But something snapped at his answer. I may be an evil demon but I took full responsibility for my reprehensible acts. And here was a noble man shrugging off some monumental blame? 

I was sure I heard the scraping of blade. The sword happy brother, I was sure. I did not look away from Rama though. 

He was giving me a beatific smile, the pompous saintly prig. 

‚ÄoeAh! There are more questions.  Only you can seek out your own answers. I wish you well in your quest‚Äù 

I stamped my feet in frustration but the chariot had moved on. 

I moped about in Lanka for days and I never found any answers. I became so unbearable that Mandodari talked me into going off the forest for another visit to my uncle‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s. The forest rejuvenates me. The greenness of the leaves, the smell of the rain, the sounds of the birds and the animals, the wildflowers in bloom , the sudden stream and unexpected lakes- they all lift my spirits. So there I was, wandering about, making unnecessarily loud noises, trampling trees underfoot and frightening the odd human and then I saw her. 

Nope, not Sita. Bet you thought it was her, up on earth from her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house.  It was Ahilya. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t recognize her at first. She was filling a pot at the stream. As I watched, she walked up to a cottage in a clearing and watered her tulsi and prayed. As she stood there, eyes closed and hands folded in prayer, I knew who she was. Suddenly, I felt that I had been brought here because she would have the answers I wanted. I took my fish-eyed form and stood beside her. 

When she opened her eyes and saw me, she smiled and said. ‚ÄoeWelcome, Soorpanakha, sister of Ravana.‚Äù 

It must be true, what they said about her powers. Because we had never met. 

I breathed in and said.‚ÄùThis is not the sister of any king, or the daughter-in-law of another, but this is just a woman come here to meet another, looking for answers. 

Ahilya smiled again and said. ‚ÄoeWelcome then, sakhi.‚Äù 

Then, as though it was the most natural thing in the world, as though she had always done it, she slipped an arm through mine and led me into her hut. 

We sat down on the front steps and then she said. ‚ÄoeI may not have the answers you seek.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeCan I ask anyway?‚Äù 

She nodded and then I asked the one question I had hoped I would never ever ask. Only it popped out as though it had a mind of its own. Maybe I was the instrument. 

‚ÄoeDid you really lust after Indra?‚Äù 

She smiled again; it looked like she was big on smiles. ‚ÄoeMy husband thought so.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBut did you?‚Äù 

She looked at me and her gaze was clear. ‚ÄoeHe was the only one who had the power to judge and he judged.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeBut Indra took the form of your husband!‚Äù 

‚ÄoePerhaps my husband thought that - if I was truly chaste I would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen through his disguise. Or he must have decided that I knew who the man really was and that  I gave in to lust. Either way you look at it, I was not chaste.. The pot breaking the previous day didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help either.‚Äù 

If this had been a movie, it would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been a foreshadowing. In real life it was just a bloody misfortune. 

‚ÄoeWeren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you angry?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWould that have mattered?‚Äù 

No, it would not have. Her husband had all the power. I nodded. 

‚ÄoeSo now you live alone.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYes, in serenity and in joy.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYou did not go and seek your husband?‚Äù 

‚ÄoeWould you have?‚Äù 

I shook my head. No, I would not seek out a man who abandoned me without a trial and left me to live as a stone for ages; for a single slightly suspect act even after years of almost servile devotion. No chance to explain, no fair hearing. Especially as nothing could be proved. I would do exactly what Ahilya had done. 

‚ÄoeYou were praying today.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄoeDo you still pray to Rama?‚Äù 

She was looking far away into the horizon. ‚ÄoeNow I pray to the trees and the birds and beasts of the forests- they nurture me, protect me and do not harm me.  Every day, I give them my thanks.‚Äù She passed and then said.‚ÄùIt is hard to pray to a man who has delivered his wife to the same fate I suffered.‚Äù 

‚ÄoeYet you do not condemn him‚Äù 

She turned to look at me, ‚ÄoeI admire Sita- her final act says it all. Think about it- Rama has to live with that memory his entire life.‚Äù 

I understood. There was no need for us to condemn anybody. Life did it, anyway. 

‚ÄoeRama answered my questions with more questions. So do you. Or you give me cryptic replies. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going on?‚Äù 

Now she smiled again. ‚ÄoeThere are no answers, Soorpanakha. Only life lessons. Learn what you can from them ‚Äoe 

I got up to go. 

‚ÄoeVisit me often, sakhi. You will always be welcome‚Äù 

We hugged and I made my first and only girlfriend ever. It was a good feeling. 

That had been a long time ago. Since then, both of us have shed our mortal forms and she has gone on to heaven or become a star or whatever it is that chaste women become. I? I am trapped in my memories, my terrible horrifying memories. 

The worst is the memory of the war. Every knows about how I brought it about. I  hate  this memory/ I hate to visit it but,I have no choice. 

I am back at my brother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s palace. He is in his chambers, resplendent and off to perform a day of ruling. I watch myself storming in, playing the helpless woman. I cringe as i watch myself complain to Ravana about the my humiliation in the hands of Rama and Lakshmana. I am filled with self- loathing. I should‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve just eaten the brothers. Maybe they would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve proved too strong.  I might‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve died in the process but at least it would have been a brave struggle. 

‚ÄoeNo, Soorpanakha.‚Äù My brother replies. ‚ÄoeYou have brought this upon yourself. Perhaps you deserve it. Rama is a righteous man, his wife a chaste woman and his brother a loyal, noble warrior.  You asked, as you should. His was the right to accept or refuse. He refused. You behaved in a vain and arrogant manner and attacked them. They did what anybody would do to protect their own. I am surprised you expect me to avenge your petty, self destructive behavior. Now clean up and put this out of your mind. I have a court to attend.‚Äù 

My brother gets ready to leave and I watch myself change and become a sly cunning witch. 

‚ÄoeBut you should‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen his wife, brother. What a peerless gem. A woman to overcome every other in all the three worlds . Lakshmi incarnate, they say and I can well believe it.‚Äù 

Bile rises in my throat at the way I praise another woman and also the base cunning I practice. Do the ends really justify the means? Surely there must be more dignified way to get my revenge? 

I watch as I talk and talk in a smooth cloying tones until Ravana is filled with lust for Sita. 

‚ÄoeI shall make her mine,‚Äù he declares and exits. 

A whoosh and I am back home. What happened after everybody knows so well that it is probably a collective memory of the people now. 

That, however, is not my worst memory. I wish I had not thought of that. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to remember.  The churning in my stomach starts and turns into an unbearable pain. I drop to my knees as the ache grows but there is no mercy. The floor beneath me vanishes and I am on hard damp earth. I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t look down and I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to- I know the damp is the damp of blood and I feel it seep into my hem.   I rise and move, stumbling over bodies of old men, young men and even boys. Some are faces I know and many are strangers but all brave and all blameless.  I walk, I falter, and I move again  and as if keeping time , the cries of young wives and lament of old mothers rise into the sky and then come back in a loud roar into my ears with the same refrain- your fault, your fault, your fault. 

Now I know, the tragedy is perhaps I knew it even then- one woman‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s lust, jealousy and humiliation is not big enough a reason to destroy a nation of good people. I understand, and I repent but I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t undo. 

There is a jerk and I am back in my room, kneeling on the floor. I know that even now I could peer over the edge of my living-space and I will see bodies of young brave men and women and I might hear that old refrain again. A part of me believes that the refrain might be true; perhaps it is my entire fault. 

I cannot run away from my memory, I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t run away from today‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s reality and I cannot run away from the thought that it was perhaps my  wanton act that  has left behind a legacy of endless war to my land. Leaving behind such a legacy perhaps deserves the punishment of being locked up in terrible memories and horrific moments for an eternity. 

I lie down on the floor, curl into a ball and weep‚Ä¶
