‚ÄoeIvaan‚Äù, where had you gone? Its third time this week that you are coming late, Ivaan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mom screamed at him. Although Ivaan already told her before going that he may be late in coming but it was an unsurprising habit of mom. At the dinner time, when mom was arranging plates for us, she asked again; where you were go after tuition classes? Was there any chess match? No mom, I went to bring up my assignment from a tuition friend , Ivaan replied. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s your duty to come back earlier at time before your dad reaches at home, mom said awfully.

Suddenly, ‚ÄoeTing ‚Ä"tong‚Äù. It was dad, he was looking very tired and it seemed to us that entire official files were disposed on him. Join us, we are already getting late for night walk, mom said to him with handed over a glass of water.

When they went for walk, Ivaan refused them and went to his room. Seeing from his window, Ivaan thought that he is not that lucky one like son of Birla or Ambani's. He began to think that his desires will not be fulfil in this birth and it will goes in hearing mom‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s remonstrance.

‚ÄoeWhy you made us so several‚Äù? Wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it possible that the whole world remain same so at least there would be no high class ‚Ä"low class botheration, Ivaan said to God in heart?

And a peculiar Dissent arose between Ivaan and almighty God. He sat to think that what would be the reason, so that the almighty God made us so different with different stratum.

What was the fault of Bikku, a roadside beggar of his street, collecting garbage from his childhood or what had anyone did so that he is enjoying this alluring world today?

If we are all same and equal for God, then why he made us so different, Ivaan thought.

Recalling his school time, Kamal, Ivaan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best opponent during Chess game, never got opportunity to sit at front because all the classmates exasperate him *‚ÄoeKaale ke aage kaala‚Äù* (A black in front of blackboard), he thought. From Ivaan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s point of view it was all God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mistakes that he created huge differences. Thinking these types of things made Ivaan to remain deplorable with God.

God does not treat us equally, he thought.

Next morning, mom was murmuring in front of God, Ivaan playing with his chess board suddenly comes.

‚ÄoeWhy it is so mom‚Äù Ivaan said. Go back to your room and take bath, mom replied.

Tell me Ivaan, why are you getting up rise so late in morning nowadays, mom said. Ivaan shocked, it is already something five -fifty and even dad has not been rise till now. Ivaan assumed that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all ‚ÄoeGod‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s kichadi‚Äù which was finely cooked by him because he never prayed to God and not took him seriously before.

He gets back to his room to start his morning mania. He came to balcony attached to his room with one hand engaged in brushing. ‚ÄoeAaa ‚Ä"thu‚Äù, Ivaan spitted without seen near by. ‚Äoe*abe gotiyaan nahi hai kya saale* ‚Äù (Don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you have eyes), Bikku said from underfoot with red eyes. ‚Äoe*kasam se bhai dekh nahi paaya*‚Äù(It is unusual bro..), Ivaan replied.

Bikku started silently his searching; it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not by hands but with a rod with a magnet at lower side to find magnetic particles. After collecting metallic things, he sells off these somewhere.

How hard for him to live this life, Ivaan thought.

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s failure so that some people cannot be able to get right job for themselves, Ivaan rumbled. Once again his problem with God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s thinking started in his mind. What would be the reason that he made him for picking garbage, Ivaan thought with taking side of Bikku.

Good morning professor, Bikku greeted. Good morning my boy, Mr. Roy, Physics professor replied, who was living in our colony from some days with his family, although he resides in the university‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hostel. He was going on bicycle, by the way he has three cars in rows which he rarely use. Ivaan heard from people about professor often ‚ÄoeLaxmi ji ki kripa hai‚Äù

Suddenly a thought came in Ivaan‚Ä<sup>~</sup>s mind that why he has not asked his question to the professor. Professor helped Ivaan many times before. Ivaan decided it to ask from professor. He knew, at this time where Professor is going. Professor is going to walk for sometime in park to reduce his diabetes. Professor will be the right person to answer it, Ivaan thought. Jumping One-Two-One, Ivaan started going to catch the Professor and reached to the ground floor. ‚ÄoeCome back timely‚Äù we have to go somewhere, mom shouted from kitchen. Ivaan started following professor in odd manner and after sometime professor noticed him that may be Ivaan wants to say something.

‚ÄoeHow are your studies going Ivaan‚Äù? Professor asked. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all fine sirs, Ivaan replied. But a question arose in my mind some days ago; Ivaan attached this statement to start a conversation with professor. Was it from Trigonometry or in kinematics? Professor asked. No, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a general one, Ivaan replied. What‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that? Professor said. ‚ÄoeGod behaves with all of us equally, then why he made us so different, Ivaan said. Pointed to Bikku who has completed his searching and preparing himself to go somewhere else, what would be his fault so the almighty God has made him a beggar, Ivaan said. Professor smiled at him and said- ‚ÄoeIts all about destiny, some gets more some gets less, completed his walk and goes back on his bicycle. Ivaan sits there in park and sees in open sky, Was it really ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>The Destiny‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, Ivaan said as he talk to God. He resume walking back to home thinking that if it is really all about destiny then why each one cannot get a good one, after all we are all God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s child and who wants to make his own child a beggar.

Ivaan doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t satisfy with professor‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s answer and the Dissent remains between him and God. He reached at home where mom is preparing lunch for us. Dad came from bathroom and sits on dining chair with towel on shoulder. He started reading newspaper in his old style, loudly. ‚ÄoeSensex down‚Äù, ‚ÄoePM visit china‚Äù, ‚ÄoeA struggle of life by H.Erics‚Äù, best selling novel of the month. He read one by one.

‚ÄoeStruggle‚Äù, what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s that dad, Ivaan interrupted. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how he started his business from a brick seller and achieve his name today in millionaire‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s front, dad replied. He worked in daytime and started also in night and reduced his sleeping hour to just five hours, dad said like he is H.Erics. Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it looks similar to Professor Mr. Roy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life?, mom said to dad. Ivaan looked at mom with open eyes. So Professor was a brick seller, Ivaan asked to mom.

Ha aha ha aha ha,

both mom and dad laughed at Ivaan. No dear, dad said.

Tell me then about him, Ivaan said.

He started his studies when his father leaves their family alone. After someday, his mother also passed away and all responsibility of himself and his sister Jessica came upon his shoulder, dad said.

What next, Ivaan said with curiosity to know about professor.

He continued his studies and joined Montessori school with the help of borrowed money from a wine seller. He goes to wine shop at evening and come back to home late night. The wine seller wanted professor to do work with him in wine shop, but professor refused him always, dad said.

Not just this, he got a bicycle from the director when he passed the examinations with first grades. Director knew that Roy has used to travel long route to come up daily. In those tough times, he had also taken care of his sister Jessica and admission her into a city hostel. Only by his love and intense care, she is today working as an accountant in multinational company; dad said and wiped head with towel.

Ivaan shocked after hearing Mr. Roy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s early life. So it was his destiny that he uprooted himself from a dark life, Ivaan said.

 No, it was his predominance and dedication which made him to remain on right path, otherwise he can opted the wine shop but he refused and did only his Karma.

Ivaan was smiling heartily as he got his answer which made him turmoil these days. Suddenly mom served them sandwiches and stopped to talk more. Ivaan firmly believes now that God has given him the answer. Now whenever he came in front of God, feels as if God is saying to him ‚ÄoeCheckmate‚Äù Ivaan. And thus ended a dreadful Dissent between a juvenile and almighty God.
