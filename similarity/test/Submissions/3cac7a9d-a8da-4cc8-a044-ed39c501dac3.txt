It was a pleasant February Friday morning, and Vinod was traveling from Vasai to Churchgate in a Virar ‚Ä" Churchgate fast local. As he used to, he had managed a comfortable window-seat because of his return trip, which involves a solid 35 minutes extra travel. He has never relented this, as that always ensured a comfortable and dispassionate travel all the way up to Churchgate, most often helping him in covering a part of the shortfall in his sleep. Often he would wonder as to whether he would ever be able to enjoy an uninterrupted 7-hour-sleep.. yes, may be in his grave.

Vinod has been working with the nation‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s biggest life insurer for the last 22 years and has been reasonably successful with the company. Never would he have thought about shifting allegiance to the other budding private insurers as he believed that he did not want to be caught between two bosses ‚Ä" one with the company and the other at home. After all, the position he was occupying presently had the greatest perk of least accountability. What else could he fancy?

Now, as he was enjoying his comfortable corner wind-blowing ‚Ä" not mind-blowing ‚Ä" seat, so many thoughts crisscrossed his mind creating rubble. All the dissatisfaction that Narmada showed him and all the words of distrust that culminated in their conversation last night made him wonder what was new in them. After all, these words of dissent from Narmada were pronounced for the n-th time to obviously disturb him. He believed that Narmada felt him to be a brainless character and so would not have been repeating those words to brain-wash him into doing something or not doing another thing. They were pure words of distrust and dissent, just short of calling for ‚ÄoeEnough is enough, let us go for a divorce‚Äù.

Nowadays, Vinod has some forethought before uttering any word to Narmada, as she would always stay opposing those views irrespective of whether those words had any meaning or logic. So. Despite all provocations he kept mum, unlike the man from Mars, without pronouncing solution to her rants. On one side he did love his wife a lot, other side he pitied her for her perverted outlook, and truly, he was more and more confounded when he made attempts to understand the root of her problems.

It all turned out that, in the past whenever there were family meetings with his parents and siblings and their respective families, Narmada was made ‚Äoeuncomfortable‚Äù with comments and remarks that have taken deep roots in her mind. Unfortunately, people around appeared to have attached very little significance to the well-being, physically or mentally, for the cordiality to prevail in both the small and big families. And as always, Vinod was perhaps fifty percent of that, not taking cognizance of Narmada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s murmurs when the infection was just beginning, to mend things or protect her so that she could have remained partly comfortable. When the infection slowly grappled Narmada‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind thoroughly into a cancer, it has become unmanageable for him.

Narmada was a graduate from a decent college in Ratnagiri when Vinod met her in a company where she was working as a receptionist. He had visited her company in his pursuit to make presentation and solicit insurance business regarding policies whose endowments would mature in time to pay for the college education of the children of the life assured. It is here their eyes met and as luck had it or otherwise, they were from the same subsects that proposal with their respective parents passed through smoothly to culminate into wedlock. Narmada was frail in nature and had a couple of miscarriages and it was Vinod‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s advice and help that made her strong enough to go through the next pregnancies to be blessed with two children, elder one being a boy who is now into his tenth grade while the younger girl child is in 6th grade. Narmada made the decision to quit her job just after her son was born, thus compromising a bit on the economics.

The turbulence in the relationships between Narmada and her sisters-in-law drove her mad for a few days and the resultant bickering were not taken too seriously by Vinod. He only thought these were quite normal and hoped things would wane and settle by itself. He was not on the right side, perhaps. The small wounds created everlasting scars in Narmada that often would get kindled on a small completely unforeseen trigger. As time passed, Vinod was getting alienated in his own family due to this incompatibility as he started avoiding his sister and the brothers and their families gradually. Though he was the last child to his parents, his indifference especially with the intention to protect Narmada from them was not considered appropriate by his siblings. To add salt to injury, when Vinod‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother died, he could not take Narmada along as she had conceived the second child, and that created a major wedge. This could not be repaired till date.

Vinod was more of keeping-it-to-oneself type of guy when it comes to domestic affairs. He never discussed the domestic politics anywhere outside with his friends. As he was so deeply engrossed in the thoughts of what has been happening with him and Narmada, he realized his train leaving the Marine Lines station, as the train was nearly empty too. He had made up his mind on something by now. He was not willing to take the pain any more. Was he approaching the end of road?

As he walked down the platform and the main pathway leading to the subway, Vinod took his mobile and started dialing his closest friend Abhijit. Vinod and Abhijit were class-mates in school as well as college. Luckily they have been working in the same city as well and Vinod felt that the time has come now to seek some friendly advice to carry out what he feels right to do. Rather he wanted a sense of comfort by finding if he could find any approval from another person. Abhijit was his closest that way, so that he would be frank and the news will not break out into rumor-mongers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> hands. Unfortunately his line was engaged.

Evening, Vinod had to pick his father from Dadar from the bus, when he arrives from Chiplun. He thought of meeting Abhijit before that so that he will discuss with him the details as quickly as possible. Luckily, Abhijit returned his call as soon as he reached his office and he summoned him to Dadar by 5.30 in the evening. Vinod briefed him on the differences surfaced between him and Narmada, grown into a sense of dissent and defeated purposes, and explained him how he has been patiently waiting that things would turn out to be better. His friend asked him a point blank question as to whether he ever tried to empathize her and gave her a few words of comfort. Vinod could not answer him affirmatively as he never ever tried to visualize the problem from her point of view. He was always thinking of his mental turmoil and was in the least bothered to comfort her. He had always chosen the path of trying to convince Narmada that what she thought was not correct, thus supporting her peril-makers. He had never visualized what went in the minds of Narmada. In essence, he did not find a sympathizer in Abhijit, and so did not have the courage to speak to him of the probable solution that was lingering in his mind since morning. All he could hear from his friend was a promise that he would keep all these things to himself and also a comforting word from him that he could discuss his problems anytime with him in person or over phone. Was it a tacit way of saying that he could not help finding a solution this being a matter between him and his wife? No. Vinod did not think of it that way, because Abhijit also told him that such differences and squabbles are around in every house, and the men folk will have to learn to live with it by handling them tactfully.

The bus arrived and he was quite happy to see his father getting down from the bus, with a bit more-than-usual extra baggage. He engaged a cab to go to Vasai, and had a normal how-is-everything type of chat. Though Vinod was putting his best efforts, his father could assess that something was bothering his flow of thoughts. He intermittently checked if he was fine and everyone alright at home. He even asked Vinod if everything was smooth in his officialdom. Vinod, of course, took it all very matter-of-factly and did not feel that his body language was giving some other message to his dad.

All was well with Narmada when she received her father-in-law. She never had any sense of disapproval for him, and definitely, she was missing her mother-in-law, more than anyone. Probably she thought she had a missing shoulder to unburden her thoughts. The grandpa unbundled his extra-baggage to give those special gifts he had brought for his grandchildren, the next day. Being a second Saturday, it was relaxed all around. Narmada got busy in the kitchen with her chores in the morning. Both the kids went out for their tuition classes. Vinod was thinking of opening up a conversation of what transpired between him and Narmada in the recent times, the sense of dissent she has for him and his inability to accept the same.

The morning TV schedule was on in the hall, and with Narmada in the kitchen, Vinod opened up his thoughts with his father and was deep into the conversation, as he got himself dragged into it. At one stage, his dad stopped him and told him to watch his flow of words, as it appeared to him that Vinod was putting all the blame on Narmada. Then Vinod came to the part when he met Abhijit and discussed, and finally finished it with his lack of courage to even spell it to him that he was now seriously contemplating about a divorce, from the girl with whom he had fallen in love only 20 years back. That is when his dad took over.

His words were fire-brand as it always used to be from a strict schoolmaster. He said that last thing first. He would never approve his contemplating on a divorce and should not expect any support from him if he went against this diktat. Then, he advised him to be sympathetic to Narmada who has been with him in his journey of life in the last 20 years. Vinod was advised to learn to respect her feelings if not opinions. He was advised not to reciprocate the dissent, which had come up from her due to certain psychological turmoil she had undergone. And finally, he told Vinod in no uncertain terms, that though he is a part of this family, at least as head of the big family, he did not mistake him or his wife for not being close to everyone. These things happen everywhere. Over a period of time, it would get alright ‚Ä" may be in his case, it was taking a little longer. He said he was contemplating on such drastic decisions without looking into the consequences. It would be more of a psychological turmoil for not only both of them, but for the kids too. And last but not the least, he felt ashamed that he had failed to imbibe in him the values of a family system and instead, his son has been possessed by the western influence, which is unfortunately creeping into our system.

Narmada wiped her tears in the other side of the room as she was listening to every word that her father-in-law had uttered. She wanted to put behind her differences with Vinod and only look into the progress of her kids from now on. That was an eye-opener.
