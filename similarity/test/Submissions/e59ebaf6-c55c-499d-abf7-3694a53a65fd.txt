 ‚ÄoeDo not make trouble for your Amma,‚Äù Aaya said. Selvi, who had been given a taste of bitter gourd poriyal for the first time, was in tears. She spat out the curry and her mother shoved some in and this charade went on until Aaya showed up with that soft yet aggressive threat.

‚ÄoeIf your Appa hears you making all this noise over food, he will beat your Amma up, you know that no? You want him to slap her?‚Äù

Selvi nodded. Her mouth still open she let out a feeble ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>no.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>

The five-year-old then washed down her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s acidic garlicky curry with the briny sobs and gags that came with her tiny tantrum, quietly.

‚ÄoeAsk me how to bring the girl in line. I will show you,‚Äù Aaya had boasted to her mother then. Aaya, her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother, had a lifetime of experience bringing girls in line after all. ‚ÄoeYou can beat up the boys and bring them your way, but on girls, you mustn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t lay a finger.‚Äù

And in this manner Selvi had been brought up to live her life avoiding trouble lest she caused someone to feel something she did not intend. She kept her legs closed together always, never parted, while she sat on the floor.

‚ÄoeWho are you inviting with those legs? Keep them together,‚Äù Aaya would scowl.

‚ÄoeWhere are you going at this time? No need to visit your classmate after sunset. Are you women whoring or what?‚Äù Aaya snapped when she wanted to sleepover at her best friend‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s home.

‚ÄoeBraid your hair. Keep red bindi only, not black. Where is your bangle? Why are you walking around like a moodevi with your hair open? Why are you without a red bindi on your forehead? Why are your hands and neck bare? If your father sees you like this he will go bankrupt! No wonder he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in debt.‚Äù

And so she never let her hair loose, outside the bathroom. Always wore a black thread around her neck and rubber bangles on both hands.

‚ÄoeDon‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t cross the line your father draws,‚Äù Aaya said, at the end of every threat as Selvi grew up, as if she was scared of something. As if Aaya foresaw something going wrong. As if she knew for sure Selvi was going to cross the line someday.

On the same day 12-year-old Selvi was yelled at for laughing with her mouth open in front of her male cousin, at the other end of town, Raj, who wore a t-shirt and jeans for his 14th birthday was taunted by his classmates.

‚ÄoeWhy are you wearing all this? Think you are Ajith or what?‚ÄùMaari who was wearing a t-shirt that said ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Long live the Kshatriyan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> asked.

Laughter.

‚ÄoeNo da, he thinks he is Vikram,‚Äù said Murugan.

More laughter.

‚ÄoeCome walk by our streets to look at our girls, wearing your jeans and t-shirt, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll break your head,‚Äù Guru hissed, ‚ÄoeAnd touch our girls and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll chop off your arms!‚Äù

Murmurs of approval.

‚ÄoeCross the line and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll show you your place,‚Äù Ramu jeered.

Threats like this had accompanied Raj all his life.

‚ÄoeWhy must you come to our temple?‚Äù caste boys would ask him in school, as his father and uncles petitioned to the district collector about the village temple denying them entry.

‚ÄoeYou want reservation. Our temples. Our water. Our land. Our women and then what? Our heads?‚Äù they would ask the 16-year-old whose only interest was football.

It would bother him, but his mother would make it alright. She would take him to the mirror and stand next to him. She would point to the boy in the mirror and say, ‚ÄoeSmile son. When they taunt you, remember that it is working, our fight.‚Äù

 At 20, strappy and tall, the taunts and threats didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bother him. His confidence seemed to bother his classmates in engineering college though. They watched him, always. Waiting for him to cross the line. Cause some trouble. They knew he was trouble. Somehow, they knew it.

There in Manakkarai, one evening at the Malai Parvathi Amman Temple, the pair of them, troublemaker-in-waiting and line-crosser-in-the-making met. Eyes blazing, hearts pounding. It was, as it happened to Simbu in the film Vinnaithandi Varuvaya, love at first sight for him. It didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t take him long to figure out where her college was and he waited in front of the bus stop the following day. She recognized him and smiled. And with that smile, a rebel was born. A new Selvi. They met every day. Just a nod here and a smile there, until her classmates from the all-women engineering college helped her take it to the next level. They encouraged coy glances. Small talk. Hand holding in towns far away from home on mofussil buses...

In his love, she found the space to be terrible. To throw tantrums. To let go. And in hers he found the words he often had to swallow. The freedom to be more like himself, than he could on the streets. They fought bitterly and often and then made up with kisses, stolen in empty fields. They had it all figured. She would become an engineer, an equal to him. And he would save up, and try to equal her father.

Selvi sat in the college canteen, during various boring lectures and delivered sweet nothings to Raj on the phone. The canteen owner, married to a cousin of hers, unbeknownst to her, set his eyes on her, much like a villain in a Tamil film. Picture a man with a moustache. Any generic man with a forgettable face. He was that. Next to Raj, who looked like an ilavarasan, a prince, clean shaven and sprightly, he looked as dull as dishwater. He delivered her orders from the pantry and overheard bits and pieces and cooked together a story in his head.

Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the generic-looking Karnan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back story. He watched his father closely, and learned to live by imitation. If his father said the fish curry was too tangy, he too found it too tangy. If his father used a slur on a man on the road, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d use the same word at the next fight that broke out in school. When he saw his father burn the huts of couples that married out of caste, he threatened to do the same to girls who spoke to boys in school. When at the ripe age of 17, he was married off to his niece, who was then 14 it was because his father too had married a niece. He unleashed the terror he saw and internalized at home, on his wife. If she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wake up before him, there was hell to pay, just the way his mother had hell to pay. If she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t listen to him, there was going to be a whipping. A slap here, a punch there. If she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stay awake until he came home, there was most certainly going to be an exercise of exorcism. He would have to give her a black eye and then as was custom, take her out to town the next day, and buy her two sovereigns of gold.

While he followed his father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s every move and internalized a hatred for the likes of Raj, what he did not realize was that he had more in common with Raj than his father. For he too had watched Simbu receive the whiplash of love in Vinnaithandi Varuvaya. He too wanted to fall in love and marry. The only catch was that at the time of the movie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s release Karnan was married and had a five-year-old daughter. Well, he figured, at least his second marriage could be one that came out of love. After all, his father had two accounts.

When he saw Selvi in college, he did his homework. He knew the girl was from his community, found out that her father owed people money, and convinced the man he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll pay up in exchange for his daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hand. Who will say no to a sweet deal like that?

But there was some hesitation. First from the mother, and then the grandmother. Wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the boy too young to be married twice? What of his first wife? And that kid? Why would they give their parrot-like beautiful little girl as a second wife? And that too when she was only 19 and was yet to finish engineering. She wanted to be an engineer. She wanted to work in the city and live independently. They approved too, because who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going to say no to a girl working in a software company? She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d only get better grooms if she went the way she wanted to go.

Karnan had hidden his arsenal well until then. He had addressed the girl‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s family with respect and love. They had let their guard down. They had offered him cola, and spoken to him about all of their debts and how the debtors were showing up at the door threatening to take them to the courts. Why hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they just wallowed in self-pity over their debts for some more time? Why did they have to gloat about their engineer-daughter doing well and blubber away about finding better boys than him? Now Karnan had to cross the line.

Just as their questions about his intentions grew shrill, he looked Selvi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father in the eye and asked, ‚ÄoeDo you know your daughter is in love?‚Äù

Silence.

Would more huts burn today? He wondered.

‚ÄoeDo you know who she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in love with?‚Äù

Stunned silence.

‚ÄoeDo you know how many hours she spends talking to him and where all I have seen them together in the last four months?‚Äù

Just as the silence threatened to engulf all of them into its shameful fold, Aaya rose from the floor. ‚ÄoeNo. No. No. No way. Not dear Selvi,‚Äù Aaya assured Selvi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father. ‚ÄoeThere must be some mistake. She has been taught to stay inside the line I draw. He has seen someone else. This is a case of mistaken identity. You wait and see,‚Äù Aaya said, biting her tongue, praying to Malai Parvathi Amman that her words come true.

Somewhere on the highway, near Manakkarai, two troublemakers in love were on their way to a lawyer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house.
