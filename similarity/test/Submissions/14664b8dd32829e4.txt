*Their Love Story* ----*Kusumita Mukherjee* *Lecturer, English Dept.* 

Atin and Shreya seemed inseparable. They had gone to the same school and now were in the same college. Both having taken Economics went to the same coaching classes as well. Atin was sincerely planning to set up an independent business after college. He tried to invite Shreya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ideas on his project. He liked basking in the sunny smile of hers. Shreya too was particularly fond of Atin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s company yet a bit of her heart had always hidden the desire of adventure. Atin was a fixture of her life she had simply got used to his pranks, his dreams and his buoyant warmth. In short, neither was sure of the kind of feeling that they had for each other. So when adventure and a sense of the new came knocking at the shape of Tarun, Shreya tried to live her life anew. On more than one occasion Shreya had noticed the man racing past them on his bike. Shreya did not at all comprehend the reason behind the turbulence in her heart caused at the sight of that particular person. It was on a Monday that Shreya found the young man pass by her. He had spotted the pot hole at the last moment and barely saved himself from having a drastic accident. Shreya unconsciously had almost let out a cry but succeeded in checking herself in time. She noticed a mobile lying down at the same spot where the man had lost control of his vehicle. She picked it up and put it inside her bag. An hour later the mobile rang. Shreya received it. At the other end was an anxious voice. 

Have you got my mobile? May I Please get it back. 

Of course you may. I picked it from the road with the precise intention of handing it back to you at the first opportunity. 

I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really explain to you how relieved I am. This phone has all the numbers of my business associates. If it had been lost I would have been miserable. My name‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Tarun Bose. Where can I meet you? 

Hi, I am Shreya Banerjee. Come and meet me at the ice-cream parlour opposite Basanti Debi College. 

Oh you do deserve an ice-cream after all you have done for me. 

I never meant that! Shreya was at once deeply embarrassed as well as excited to meet a man with such a sense of humour. Her blushing face prompted Atin to poke fun at her for behaving like an awestruck school-girl. Their meeting at the ice-cream stand was not the last but the first among the many long encounters to come after it. Tarun met her usually after her coaching classes and made it a point to drop her off near her home on his bike. He took care of her comfort, her likes and dislikes in a way Atin had never done. All this had its impact on Atin too. He felt sidetracked. But on the flipside he finally came to understand his deep emotional entanglement with Shreya. In a bid to recover his share of attention from Shreya he wrote a poem for her in the college magazine but Shreya seemed to simply rush through the words, trying to be polite, without attempting to grasp their meaning. Atin realised that Shreya had created a separate sphere of her own. Tarun and Shreya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s relation on the other hand was becoming stronger by the day. At every opportunity Tarun declared his love for her and pleaded with her to sincerely start thinking about marrying him. This devotion of Tarun totally mesmerized Shreya. She too secretly started planning about disclosing her intention of marrying Tarun to her parents. But at the precise moment when such an opportunity presented itself she lost her nerve. Meanwhile Tarun had taken her to visit his ancestral shop at Burrabazar but failed to persuade Shreya to enter who was apprehensive of appearing in Jeans before her future in-laws. Shreya was enjoying every moment of her togetherness with Tarun. He seemed eager to please every whim and fancy of hers. On her birthday Tarun wanted her to gift her something really special. He insisted on giving her a diamond ring but Shreya vehemently opposed this proposal saying she would never be able to explain its presence before her parents. Finally they decided upon buying a dress from an online retailer. Tarun tried to use his credit card but failed. He was growing irritated at his repeated letdown. Shreya suggested they use her online bank account instead. Tarun only accepted this idea of Shreya after giving her the amount in cash. By now his mood was back to being jovial again. He turned his attention back to his laptop and asked, 

I hope you have sufficient balance? 

Sufficient? Mr. this is my father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s account. At any given time there is above 10lakhs in his account. Looking into his eyes Shreya entered the username and password of the account. There were smiles on both their radiant faces. At night Shreya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father suggested booking their air-tickets for the Puja Vacation. In a teasing tone Shreya began: 

Baba, how many times have I told you start operating your account on your own? 

Darling I am really a technologically illiterate man. How will I be able to operate such a complicated system? Shreya‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s smile slowly started fading as the message ‚ÄoeTransaction declined‚Äù appeared over and over again. With a bated breath Shreya went on to check the balance in her father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s account. There was zero balance in the account. Tarun! After her father had left early next morning to report the forgery Shreya managed to slip out avoiding her mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s notice. She had not totally given up on Tarun and so had not informed her father about him. With a lot of scrambling among the labyrinths of Burrabazar she finally managed to locate the shop that Tarun had claimed to be his ancestral shop. Apprehensively she approached the elderly gentleman sitting closest to her and asked, 

Please be kind enough and tell me who the owner of the shop is? 

This is the property of Salim Taufiq Rahman; Handed down to the Rahmans since 1967.
