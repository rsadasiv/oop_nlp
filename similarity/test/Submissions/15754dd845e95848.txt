*Dinner * 

For the life of her, Amma couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get the portions right anymore. Every night we tried to finish the food off - the rice, the curries, the fried fish or chicken - and on most nights we more or less succeeded, Appa and I, though it left us feeling bloated. The heavy dinners put me to sleep when I tried to study at night, and Appa started getting indigestion problems. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d wake up in the middle of the night, my face stuck to the pages, and find him reading a newspaper out in the hall or pacing the verandah. But if we saw each other at night, we never talked, nor did we mention the encounter the next morning. 

The amount of food Amma made differed every day: sometimes there would be a lot left over, more than we could eat no matter how hard we tried, so we would stick it in the fridge without a word; other times, there would only be a little left over, or if we could help it, nothing at all. In the beginning, it oscillated between these ends. 

* 

The following week my sister returned from her honeymoon. Coming back from college on the evening of her return, I found a note on the fridge from Amma informing us that she had gone to visit her. It said that my sister had come down with a slight fever. Amma hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t made dinner, but I wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hungry anyway. Once Appa returned from work though, the two of us spread out all the left-overs from the fridge on the work-top and went through them one by one. There were a lot of different sized containers. Some of the food had to be thrown out, but others were as good as new. In the end, we had fried cod, fried mackerel, curried chicken, some curd rice, white rice, long beans, stir-fried cabbage and half an omelette â€" not all of them the same age. The meal wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t all bad. And to me at least, it seemed strangely satisfactory to empty out the fridge. 

When Amma returned home later that night, she had already eaten. But the dinner she had had at my sisterâ€<sup>TM</sup>s in-lawsâ€<sup>TM</sup> didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t agree with her, and the very thought of food seemed to revolt her. She had a sensitive stomach attuned only to what she was used to, and spent the entire night throwing up. 

Amma was sick for the next few days, and she ate nothing but porridge and lime pickle. We also ate porridge, but when we tired of it, Appa and I bought roti and egg curry from a greasy eatery nearby, and since the smell and sight of mostly all foods revolted Amma, ate it out in the hall. There we spilled gravy on the couch, and curry-stained the TV remote trying to find the right channel.

Amma started cooking again in less than a weekâ€<sup>TM</sup>s time. This time, she started making things she had never made before. She printed out a whole bunch of these recipes and stacked them by the fridge.  One night she made Gobi Manchurian and another time she made Chicken Rogan Josh. Neither was very good, but we didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t complain. Amma also started experimenting with different kinds of table arrangements. Sometimes there would be flowers or empty flower vases on the table; other times, decorative table mats and plates we had never seen before, none of them plain or white. Mostly, they depicted scenes from the daily lives of far-off people. 

Once she made shiitake mushrooms, which we then ate by candle light, on a blue plate that showed sailors playing cards. 

At around the same time, our portions started coming down too. At first, they were as humungous as before. But slowly they dropped - for a very brief period it seemed like the right amount- until soon they resembled the microscopic portions you saw on Masterchef. One day we were going to sleep half full of air.

My sister visited us that same week for the first time since she got married. She came alone and without notice and inspected the house like it was a museum and she was the director. Although she had lived here for almost twenty-four years, she went room to room like it was all different. It felt a little like a spot-check. She asked if this was new or if that was new, and after visiting my room, told Appa that it reeked of cigarette smoke. Her new husband smoked like a chimney too, but Appa and Amma didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know that. 

My sister and I spent some time sitting in her old room and I asked her how things were and she said they were good. She told me she had tried smoking and that it was nice. Her husband smoked the same brand as I did. 

Shortly before she left, I asked her how much she used to eat when she lived here. â€<sup>~</sup>How much? Why?â€<sup>TM</sup> she said, laughing. 

â€<sup>~</sup>Yeah, like how much.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

She thought about it for a second. â€<sup>~</sup>Not much,â€<sup>TM</sup> she said. â€<sup>~</sup>Very little.â€<sup>TM</sup> 

Sister didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t stay for dinner that night, but after her visit, the portions started to go up until once again it was so much more than we could eat. Sometimes we had enough food to feed our clones and their clones too: a large dinner table of clones. My jeans got uncomfortably tight, my face got a bit plump, and I began to sprout little love handles like cherub wings.

On the night of Republic day, not long after, we decided to give it all a break and get food from our favorite restaurant nearby. Appa went out and bought their specialty combination: schezwan fried rice, boneless chilli chicken, and a bowl of raita. They came in shiny red plastic containers with the logo of happy chicken. Amma wiped the table and set down the table mats. I got the plates and bowls and spoons, and Appa served the food. Then, just as we were about to begin, sister called and she invited us to go eat dinner at her place. 

We tried to stuff the food into the refrigerator, but it was too full, and no matter how we rearranged it, it stayed full. Not even the freezer had any room to spare. In the end, we left the dinner on the table â€" the rice still steaming Â­Â­â€" and left as fast as we could.
