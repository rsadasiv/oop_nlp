*WAIT* 

‚ÄoeMalabar squirrel ", he exclaimed. You looked closely. The knowledge of wiping a blood stained weapon, quietly, noiselessly tucking it away in an invisible corner played in those cold eyes. You minimized the Facebook screen and shuffled mind like a pack of cards. Nothing much appeared to have changed, except that the beast in him had grown larger.Thirty years add quite some volume into life. Memories too. 

The wedding festivities were in full swing that summer morning. Entrance of the courtyard was decorated with sweet scented jasmine and stuffy marigold. A huge white shamiana had gone up, neatly separating the lawns on the outer edge.  The eldest daughter of the household was being married off.  Women were busy in the kitchen, overseeing the cooks. Children played in the large courtyard. What else did you remember? A Mercedes Benz was being decorated with jasmine flowers, a gift from the bride‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s father who nonchalantly sat on the front verandah fanning himself with a newspaper, front buttons of his white shirt undone. He was always sweating. ‚ÄoeBaloo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù he called, voice resonating with fondness. 

Where was Baloo ?  Chequered shirt buttoned up till neck, flared bell bottomed trousers firmly held with a leather belt, slick hair combed with a side parting, Baloo appeared, his right boot resting on the edge of the carpet. Did he not look like a superstar? Adulation poured on an immune Baloo. 

Meet Baloo, the only son, heir to the empire of spices. Fourteen years, threshold of adulthood, Baloo‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s conquests ranged from breaking a glass cupboard to eat the fried goodies neatly locked away inside to breeding pedigreed dogs. Baloo whose lips were ashen from smoking stolen gold flakes. Baloo who ran away from school. No he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, he just bunked a few classes with willing allies. That isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a crime. Every boy has done that at one point or other. Now please, restrain yourself, a voice tells you. Character assassination. Do not forget for a moment, there are enough people ready to sink their nails into your flesh for this unpardonable crime. At least have a thought for the old lady, the voice pleads. She gifted you a pressure cooker on your wedding. A little gold ring when your first born arrived. The countless phone calls, first ones, usually on every birthday. Exchange of affection. The crisp hundred rupee note pushed into your palm when you passed high school with distinction, grandfather‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s frozen body lay on a white bedspread on the floor in a room away. Libel, slander. Could it hurt more than the prick which has lodged itself in your core? You let it remain, the dull pain slowly ate away into your cerebrum like white noise. You tried to dislodge it, like trying to take off a nail from the wall. Wall crumbled. Bled. 

Let us talk of something else. More comfortable conversations. Maybe the pedigree line of the German Shepherd panting in the kennel. It has descended from Caesar I of Yorkshire, a strange contradiction. Nevertheless what matters is that the German Shepherd is pedigreed. It has consecutively won ‚ÄoeBest Dog‚Äù award in the three dog shows held by Kennel Club of India. Starve it for three days and you know that it will eat shit. Like Baloo. Now, not again, the voice goes. There is a migraine in your head. You try to fix it by drinking water.  Forehead scorches. Memories have planted themselves as white hair on your head. Count one memory for one white hair. Pluck a hair to erase a memory. 

Abba played loud as the young and old circled around the teapoy  with brimming glasses in what seemed like an ancient tribal ritual. You loved Trinca, but tonight they had only fizzy drinks. You liked white, so you went for Limca. Tiring, taking seat, getting up and dancing, the ritual continued till midnight. You had to relieve yourself. Did you not feel lost? Where was mother, bride‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s aunt?  Were you old enough to climb on the European toilet?  Now why did they have to have that name? You were barely seven. Chopped off hair, front tooth peeping out to nudge your lower lips. Black and white photographs show you wearing frilly frocks. You looked lost in every frame. You were lost that night also. Where was mother? You couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait, you climbed on to the toilet. You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have much memory. You did not see Baloo.  You always left door half open. Or half closed? When did Babloo enter? Pressing himself, Baloo asked whether it hurt. Dazed, you were silent. You were not hurt. You were a mere child. Baloo perhaps not experienced, had pounced on what appeared to be an opportunity. The daze was broken when Chinnan, the skinny little servant boy entered . ‚Äoe Chinna‚Ä¶ pour water in the bucket for the child‚Äù , Baloo said hurriedly, extracting himself. 

You would not like to keep memories.  You would pluck the white hair. 

You were not hurt. 

Outside you can hear the squirrels shrieking, running up the mango trees. A cat waits beneath, its right paw on the trunk, aligned to climb. It eyes gleam with the cold knowledge of many memories. It licked its whiskers in relish. In wait.
