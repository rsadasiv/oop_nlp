Mr. Negi, wearing a simple robe woven from wild threads, came upon the Palace of Peace which stood incongruous in the midst of well maintained lawns. To him the designed patches of green were as incongruous to Earth but nobody around that place would have deemed him serious if he had decided to tell them so. He had visited the palace several times in the last few months but as the final judgement drew close he felt a never before air of anxiety about the building. Quaintly it seemed to be waiting for the verdict as well. The verdict that would decide once and for all between the legitimacy of two battling ideas, one that had long conquered human mind, hence the Earth, and the other now barely existent in human mind-space.

Mr. Negi walked on the path leading to the main entrance of the Palace lined with neatly pruned Chinar trees on both sides. He had always loved the act of walking but hated other modes of travel he had to use to get to the Palace. The other modes meddled with his thought he would oft opine and walking enhanced it. That day he needed to drop in some documents for consideration by the judges presiding the case. The case that him and his wife were litigating in against the rest of humanity. Sunshine frittered in through the foliage and formed beautiful patterns on the path soothing Mr. Negi's mind. However the beauty of that sight was lost on the rest of humanity as for them the idea of beauty itself had been caged and restricted. The only exception being the residents of the alcove, Mr and Mrs. Negi's alcove. Mr. Negi thought about it and sighed. His wife was not with him that day as it was not a day of hearing else they would have sighed together.

The residents of the alcove, a rapidly depleting minority called themselves Naturalists as opposed to the majority Capitalist Consumerists. They occupied the last virgin patch of forest watered by an undammed, unmodified stream of natural spring water. The Negis had spent their entire life living with and leading that rare defiant tribe, fighting to exist in a consumerist world. Their ancestors had done the same over generations and the couple, childless, seemed to be the end of that legacy. They had built no house and chose a dense and rich grove of trees filled with varied fauna to live in. The others in the alcove were not as congruous and lived in houses made of nature derived, unprocessed materials or in naturally formed rock caves. The other residents would often ask the couple the reason for their choice of residence to which they gave an age old reply, always with a smile, 'The grove is our home. In it we feel a sense of balance and harmony, a happiness. In short what we experience in this grove is difficult to put into mere words.'

At other times the Negis also occupied other spaces inside the alcove. These too had overgrown with plants and animals of diverse kinds. Greater the diversity they lived with and imbibed, greater the enrichment of the couple's inner being became. The more of nature they experienced the closer their accord with it grew. Sometimes nature even spoke to them, through them and when this happened all the residents of the alcove traveled to their grove, gathered around and listened in. The couple embodied everything that was anathema to the constructed consumerist culture.

According to the consumerists the Negis and the alcove people were a disgrace to the resource guzzling potential of humanity. Their own plan was to use up every available resource on the planet and then move on to colonise another. To this end Earth had been analysed, categorised and constructed upon, plants and animals either domesticated directly, genetically modified and domesticated or eliminated by means of artificial extinction. All things wild had been tamed. Utopia for human culture had been realised. The human mind itself had been first manipulated, then moulded and defined which had made the accomplishment, the planet being brought to order, much easier. The last free minds living in the Negis' alcove had evaded this ordering and the capitalists had gone berserk to know how. They had tried all that they could to bring them in but to no avail.

Whenever the Negis travelled out of the alcove a label was stuck on their dresses which identified them as residents of the primitive alcove. They were met with derision everywhere much in accordance with the controllers' mandate. People pointed at them and sniggered, did not go too close lest the sickness of their mind would creep up on them. The couple did not get affected by such hatred and remained as much in balance as before. Their uber natural disposition had ensured a solitude which they had made their own. Inside the alcove the few people who had yet evaded the call of the shining world met with the couple and exchanged views and ideas. These were the ones still in possession of their minds, still unmasked in them was the primordial call of nature. The mockers and sniggerers could never come to terms with the sanity of these individuals who were in love with untamed, uncertain wilderness as compared to the certainly beautiful constructions of consumerism.

The Negis were convinced of the existence of a natural power unfathomable to the human mind though not alluding to any organised religion, plenty of which were existent in the consumerist world. These simply played to the definition of the human mind like all the other constructions. Such was this natural power that it spilled out of the couple and needed a vent. So within and to the atmosphere of hatred and vitriol the Negis professed their conviction about nature, it's power and it's resurgence. Not many would listen and fewer still would register but the cold shoulder never disheartened them and they would just say what they wanted to. These campaigns frequently brought them into conflict with the mind police, in charge of keeping law and order in the minds of the populace, and eventually lead them to be dragged to the courts where again they argued valiantly in favour of nature. The controllers sitting on top of the consumerist dispensation grew frustrated and wanted this mind riot to end immediately and finally. They wanted the prophetic couple to mend their ways, come out of their delusion along with the rest of the alcove and the couple wanted the consumerists to come out of their own.

The Consumerists after some bouts in the lower courts brought the Naturalists to the highest court, the Palace of Peace. The Negis initially protested the legitimacy of the court itself to deliver the final judgement but later gave in for an unknown inspiration and a lack of real judges. Both parties then agreed upon the case to be decided within the purview of a congregation of the highest moral character whatever it meant for the capitalists. The couple confidently represented the alcove and argued the case by themselves against an army of lawyers and assistants who were fielded to argue on account of the capitalist dispensation by the fiercest law agency .

The couple articulated that at first the human felt as much a part of nature as nature felt a part of her. In time as the human mind evolved and accumulated knowledge nature appeared to be a challenge to human progress in the realm of culture. To begin with this clash was well within the scope of nature but later morphed into a dichotomy in a majority of human minds. This the Negis argued was rather a passing evolutionary phase. The dichotomous thought that culture was divergent from nature wasn't actually true. They claimed that culture was divergent from nature only up-to a point of realisation, the realisation that culture has sprung out from nature and will eventually go back to it. It's cyclical. The Negis argued that there could be consequences if this reversion did not happen and the cycle was not completed. Nature, they said, had it's own ways and means of correction unknown to the egoistic human. The lawyers in turn replied in a caustic tone that Consumerist Capitalism had won over Natural Being with its efficiency a long time back. They said that the alcove residents were spewing hogwash and constituted a prickly anomaly like specks on the perfect painting, the last of the absurd, weird kind of human. According to them the naturalists were not to be taken seriously by the judges and needed to surrender their minds willingly.

Since the proceedings of the case had begun and the arguments of the Negis were becoming known to people in the Palace of Peace and outside, tiny pockets of subtly dissenting minds had started flowering near and far. The wielders of power were turning and twisting over this development.

The redoubtable Negis asserted and re-asserted the point that Nature and Culture had never constituted a dichotomy and that they never will. They lamented that the consumerists had denigrated their fellow beings on the planet, they had moulded them as they had moulded steel, concrete and glass. For them the consumerists' wood was not really wood, their leaves not really leaves, their fruit and flower not really fruit and flower. These were products of the dichotomous trap that humanity had fallen into. The couple further stated, 'Wildly growing nature enshrines an essential completeness that no amount of expert design and beautification could provide. This completeness forms the very core meaning of existence.' 'How will the capitalists create this completeness? Could they ever?' The couple queried. The capitalists came back with the claim that their invention, Money, had solved all problems and hence had provided the required and defined completeness, a certain freedom. The Negis replied that Money did give freedom for some time but then stealthily took it away.

The lawyers declaimed that they did not recognise this immaterial completeness that the Naturalists kept harping about? They asked for evidence. Only verifiable evidence of such an ethereal sense could make them believe. 'All religions of the day have requisite causes then why is something still uncertain. When even God has been resolved how is something still left to be?' They asked.

The Negis had started speaking in a cohesion which was now slowly tuning to a symphony. One gave the meter the other rhythm to their poetry and none could differentiate one from the other. They had truly become one and out from their mouths flowed the answer to the last consumerist query, 'Chaos trumps resolution, Chaos is beauty, the experience of Beauty is the purpose of the Universe', in unison. A raucous cacophony echoed within the Palace of Peace after the Negis' declaration. Contempt and joy had erupted together on the consumerists' side in the form of derisive laughter. Then Mrs. Negi for the first and last time spoke up alone, her voice like a flowing river, 'When order and control become extreme, dissent too has to transcend its limits.' More laughter was heard in the room at this statement and the proceedings for the day were brought to a close.

On the day of the final judgement the Negis, both dressed in simple robes woven from wild threads, walked the path textured with light and shade. A distinct sparkle was visible in their eyes as they climbed up the stairs to enter the Palace of Peace. Before a jeering crowd a volley of argument ensued that seemed never ending with the light of reason oscillating between a retinue of consumerist lawyers and the couple. A row of judges sat behind their high desk listening in, ready to hand down the last judgement. After almost twenty hours of deliberation the couple was finally declared guilty of dissenting against the truth and law of consumerism born out of the democratic commitment of all the people of Earth.

The defendants, the alcove people, looked upon their leaders for a hint of response but the Negis simply stood their ground. They looked around the court room slowly, not a word was spoken nor an emotion expressed. But their bearing betrayed an expectation, an urgent and massive expectation. The capitalists and their lawyers anticipated a burst of emotion, cries and whatnot from the naturalists, especially their leaders. But they did not get anything. Then out of the blue a huge tree trunk burst out of the western wall of the Palace of Peace and the floor was soon covered with plants and animals of all hues along with the screams and shouts of the humans. Self Preservation it seemed was nature's last argument.
