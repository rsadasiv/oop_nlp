*The Final Departure Lounge* 

Father called a few minutes back and pleaded once more, ‚Äoe*Beta*, come back home. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no point. Jahnvi *won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t *return.‚Äù  My hesitant protestations of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>you never know‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> were met with the same doleful request - in the background I could hear *Maa*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s low voice wondering why I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t listen to them. What *Maa *and* Papa* didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t realize was that I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t waiting for Jahnvi - I wanted to try and go to where she had gone. 

And even after the call was over, I could hear *Papa*‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s voice floating to me in an endeavour to get me back. It seemed to come from across the lounge, gliding over all the people, through the silences of goodbyes and conversations of hesitant send-offs. 

I clasped my hands together and rested them on the top of my head. My eyes must have been shut for about two seconds when I opened them again. What if my Jahnvi walked out and I missed her? So far she had not; in fact no one left the building. And among all those who were going in, very few were laughing and smiling - most looked around with apprehension. 

In the distance, I could see some of the buildings silhouetted against a fast-dimming sky that looked more purple than blue - narrow ribbons of white clouds accentuated this darkness. Some of those misty fluffs were pencil-thin as if the reminiscence of an aeroplane gone by. 

Since when had I been here? I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember. I looked at my wrist; it was five minutes to seven. How much longer would I wait for her? I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know the answer to that one either - at least not as yet. I turned my neck sideways to relieve some of the stiffness that had permeated my body. The pain in my stomach had increased somewhat and I felt enervated - I needed to rest but I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to go too far away lest I fail to see her if she walked out. I moved towards a row of four orange chairs. Could I see the door from here? Good. As I lowered myself into one of them, it rocked and made a creaking sound - all this while, my eyes were fixed on the entrance. A boy sitting next to me was punching in his mobile phone. As he typed in his message, there was an unhurried regularity to the beep-beep of the keys. 

Jahnvi had tried to rationalize the inevitability of her departure, ‚ÄoeI have to go. Let me at least see what is there and what it is like.‚Äù I knew that we did not have a choice. When I told her, ‚ÄoeI also want to accompany you Jahn,‚Äù she had said, ‚ÄoeNo. Not now.‚Äù 

Deep down, I had a conviction that she might just turn back; somehow fight the odds even though they were stacked against us, and beyond her control. But I felt helpless and hoped that, by some means, she would return to me. 

I glimpsed a flash of white cross from my left. A faint aroma seemed to follow it - I took a deep breath to try and place it - it was gentle and delicate but not like that of my Jahn. Hers was different; I was incapable of finding a word for it. Just like I was could never, to her satisfaction, tell her why I found her special. *The* one. She used to tease me about it ‚ÄoeYou love me, don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you? Then why can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you tell me why?‚Äù I would try all the clich√©s about beauty, wit, and intelligence but the reality was that I would be lost for words - that was her effect on me. 

Whenever I was near her, I felt as though I could keep on inhaling forever without the fear of bursting my lungs. And as my breath would become deeper, the aroma would become stronger ‚Ä" as if I were getting closer to her, till I became one with her. And now also, I could feel her fragrance seep through my nostrils, into my entire body. 

As the white blur whizzed past, I discerned the shape of a very tall girl. I tried to work out her height and looked towards her feet to see if she was wearing any heels. No heels - in fact, no shoes. I saw her feet walk in through the door along with the others who were also barefoot. Why did no one have any footwear on? 

Now I found myself watching all those ankles and toes - some of the pairs walked in slowly, others with the unlikely confidence of having been there earlier. All of them were, however, bound together by their direction. 

I did not care about the others - I just wanted one pair to walk out towards me. I visualized those feet in my hands now. I stroked her right foot and bent forward and skimmed my lips against the ankle. I looked up and saw her smiling ‚Ä" I kissed the big toe and then the dainty small one. As I ran my fingers over it, barely touching her skin, I could feel her stiffen. She closed her eyes and pulled me towards herself - when her lips brushed mine, I sensed the same aroma in my lungs. 

I took another deep breath, furrowed my eyebrows and grimaced as I remembered where I was - people were still going in. The older ones walked in at a slow pace, but with a certain sureness in their step. The gait of the younger ones, however, was more hesitant - I saw a girl of about five being helped in by a man in a white coat and a reassuring smile; as they walked towards the entrance I could feel her large eyes searching for a familiar face. The man took her to the door and then as the girl stepped inside, she smiled. I remember asking myself, wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t she wearing a bandage when she walked in. The man in the white coat, still near the door, was on his toes and craned his neck to get a glimpse. But when he put his hands inside his coat and walked back, I could sense that he had not been able to see inside. All this while his right hand was tapping the stethoscope around his neck. 

Why didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t they let me in? I had waited for the guard at the door to change so that I could try again. But even the new one didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let me in; he said, ‚ÄoeYou aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t allowed to go in sir. Not now.‚Äù My sense of desperation did not have an impact on him as he told me to move away from the entrance. I requested him to send word to his chief - with a reluctant ‚ÄoeOK, *theek hai*,‚Äù he took down my name on a sheet of paper and sent it inside. 

The orange chair creaked again as I shifted in my position slightly to get a better view of the door. I was feeling nauseous and the pain in the stomach was now becoming unbearable - I just wanted to double up on the floor and go to sleep. Instead, my eyes wandered towards an old man with a lot of luggage. ‚ÄoeSorry sir, but you are not allowed to take those inside,‚Äù one of the officials told him. The old man tried to argue with him and when the official did not relent, he asked the young man who had come to drop him to take the bags - the young man looked confused and I wondered about the authenticity of the tears in his eyes. The old man then hung his head and walked inside to where my Jahnvi was. 

Someone ran in and I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help thinking, ‚ÄoeThis one is really in a hurry to go.‚Äù As I pondered this, I saw a couple standing near the gate. The man, who had come to drop his wife, wanted to photograph her but she gestured him not to. As he put the camera into its case, I could see his liquid eyes staring at her but she was trying to avoid looking at him. He gave her a hug and held her, but she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t return his embrace, her limp hands just hung by her side. As she pulled herself from him, I realized that the woman had a puffed up abdomen and there were stains of red on her *salwar*. Even after she had gone in, the man did not move - he merely stood there, hoping, perhaps just like me. I wondered if that woman would meet my Jahnvi. 

I looked at the translucent windowpane that separated me from the interiors of the building to try to see what was happening inside, but was not able to make anything out. I wanted to get closer to somehow catch a glimpse. 

Another old man was going in alone; he stooped on his walking stick as he took each step, a measured approach to the door. When he reached the entrance, the guard asked him to hand in his stick before going in. The old man nodded his head in disapproval at the thought of giving up his sole support. Knowing he had no choice, he placed it in the guard‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s outstretched hands. But as he walked in, his back seemed to become upright and I was surprised by the agility with which he entered. 

Through the murky window, I discerned a silhouette walking out - against the crowd. Was it my Jahn? As I watched this person walking towards the door, a bead of sweat formed on my right temple. The droplet worked its ways downward and stopped as the person came closer to the door. When the person was finally about to appear, I looked down towards my feet, and then glanced up, hoping to see Jahnvi. But it was not she. The pain in my stomach intensified and I felt like throwing up. The boy sitting next to me was still punching into his mobile but the rhythmic beep-beep of key-tapping was slower than before. 

The man who walked out was dressed in a black cloak with a hood. He held a scythe in his hand and had creases on his brow. The stern-ness of his smile made me nervous. With his arrival, there now seemed to be a buzz of activity around me in the departure lounge. Some looked at him with suspicion, others smiled on seeing him. He appeared quite old and I smiled on seeing the scythe in his hand. 

He walked up to me and said, ‚ÄoeYou‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got permission to go in. You want to?‚Äù The smile in his eyes belied the seriousness of his question. 

On seeing me reciprocate with an affirmative nod, he raised his eyebrows, lines suddenly forming on his forehead. I wondered if my enthusiastic ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>yes‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> had changed his mind. But those creases smoothed out as he broke into an even bigger smile. As I got up, he put a hand on my shoulder and pointed towards my shoes gesturing to me to remove them. When I also handed over my watch, I noticed that the time was still five minutes to seven. I then opened my wallet to take out Jahnvi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s picture before giving it up. He smiled, ‚ÄoeNow you wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need that where you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going.‚Äù 

I smiled as both of us started walking towards the entrance of the final departure lounge. 

The boy next to me seemed to have finished punching his message into the mobile. His phone made one last long beep as he pressed the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>send‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> butting before putting it away in his pocket. 

I would be with my Jahn soon. Forever.
