My name is Scott Richard Hoying. My family is fairly normal, if you consider an anxiety-ridden mother after her husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s death trying to raise three children on her own as your idea of normal. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m seventeen now and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m the middle child.

It was nearly the end of May so my last year of high school was approaching faster than I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d have liked. As I was thinking about how I was going to get through another year of high school, the ringing of my landline interrupted me. ‚ÄoeHello?‚Äù, I asked. ‚ÄoeHey, Scott? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s me.‚Äù Travis always does this thing where he calls my landline and says ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s me‚Äù and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m somehow just supposed to know that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s him. I mean, he is my only friend and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not like I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think about his deep, soothing voice every minute of everyday, reading to me and‚Ä¶ ‚Äoe Hello? Scott? Do you want to come over or not? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just be us.‚Äù Oh dear Lord, just him and I? ‚ÄoeOkay! I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be there!‚Äù ‚ÄoeSee you tonight, bye!‚Äù Why did I say yes? I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been feeling all these feelings for him all of a sudden and I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t trust myself to keep it to myself. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been friends since middle school and I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let a stupid crush come in the way of it all.

For the past month, my little sister Sophie and I have been carefully watching a boy who walks his dog, at exactly half past four in the evening. I think he just moved to our neighbourhood because I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never seen him here before. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s odd. Today, he was wearing a white sleeveless top with a black skirt that reached down to his knees paired with purple converse shoes and a black hat. Sophie dares me to talk to this boy every day but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m scared. Odd Boy is one of the few things that Sophie and I have in common.

I went over to Travis‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> house that night feeling a bit nervous. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know why but I had a feeling in my gut. After dinner, we went up to his room where he said he needed to talk to me about something important. My heart was racing but I tried to look as calm as I possibly could.

‚ÄoeScott, you know Claire, right?‚Äù ‚ÄoeYeah, what about her?‚Äù ‚ÄoeWell, a couple of days ago, she asked me if I wanted to be her boyfriend and guess what I said?‚Äù No. No. No. I hope you said no. ‚ÄoeYes?‚Äù ‚ÄoeYES! Oh my God Scott, you know she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like the nicest girl in our school right? I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe she asked ME!‚Äù Of course she did. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m happy for you, Trav.‚Äù ‚ÄoeYeah but see the thing is, she wants me to hang out with her friends from now.‚Äù Oh. I see where this is going. Boy dates girl, boy gets to hang out with the cool kids now, leaving behind sad little Scotty. ‚ÄoeHey, yeah. I totally understand. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be fine by myself.‚Äù ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only at school though, Scott. We can still hang out at my place or yours whenever we want!‚Äù ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s great. I have to get going now. I promised mum I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be home before 10.‚Äù I lied. Mum doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t care when I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m home. She probably hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t realised that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m gone.

I was walking back home and as I was turning into my street, I bumped into Odd Boy. ‚ÄoeSalutations.‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄoeSalu-what?‚Äù ‚ÄoeGreetings, I mean. Where are you off to, sir?‚Äù ‚ÄoeUh, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just going home.‚Äù ‚ÄoeAh yes, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve seen you and the little girl watching me from over your fence.‚Äù Oh shit. He knows? I thought we were hidden, but apparently not. ‚ÄoeOh um, we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mean to be creepy. We were just looking at your odd collection of clothing.‚Äù ‚ÄoeOdd, you call it? Why is that?‚Äù ‚ÄoeWell, boys don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wear skirts.‚Äù ‚ÄoeAnybody can wear anything they like, silly boy.‚Äù Silly? He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the one wearing skirts and he calls me silly. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m so done with him. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had a rough night already. ‚ÄoeI have to go.‚Äù ‚ÄoeHave a wonderful night ahead, sir. I will see you soon.‚Äù ‚ÄoeBye, Odd.‚Äù

Anybody can wear anything they like? Stupid, I thought. That night I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stop thinking about Odd Boy and his ways.

I woke up the next morning terrified of what was coming on my last first day of high school. I put together my usual jeans and one of my t-shirts and called it an outfit. My brother Brandon can drive but he never takes Sophie and I to school in the morning so we take the bus together. The school bus was unusually early this morning and we reached half an hour before the first bell. I walked up to the second floor and went in to the library so I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to be alone. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to read or anything but I took a random book from one of the shelves and sat down on one of the chairs in the corner where no one can see me.

‚ÄoeThe Catcher in the Rye?‚Äù, a familiar voice asked. I turned to the side to find Odd Boy taking a seat next to me. ‚ÄoeHuh?‚Äù ‚ÄoeI didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think you were the usual rebel kind.‚Äù He was wearing a red flannel shirt and leggings with a pair of black boots. ‚ÄoeWell, I might be. My name is Scott, by the way.‚Äù ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m Mitch Grassi. We met last night.‚Äù ‚ÄoeOf course, I remember. Someone who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s as odd as you are is hard to forget.‚Äù ‚ÄoeWhy do you keep saying that? Odd? Just because you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re wired to think of the clothes people wear as a form of gender identity doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make me odd at all. You should try wearing skirts some day, Scott. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d lend you mine but you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a size too big.‚Äù The first bell interrupted our conversation so I scurried to class without as much as a ‚ÄoeSee you later!‚Äù

Mitch was beautiful, to be honest. A beautiful boy. He had a chiselled jawline, a perfect nose, plump, slightly pink lips and brown eyes that could have you captivated forever. You could lose yourself in his curls. Maybe that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what I was scared of. I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t mind so much that he was ‚Äoeodd‚Äù anymore. I really need a friend. I mean, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have Travis to hang out with anymore so I guess I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll hang out with Mitch. ‚ÄoeScott Hoying? Can you solve question 4 on the board?‚Äù Oh no, never get called on by Mr. Gerald. He only calls on people when he knows they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been dreaming and not paying attention. ‚ÄoeNo, Sir.‚Äù ‚ÄoeThen pay attention!‚Äù Ah, guess it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to stop thinking about Mitch.

That evening after school, Sophie and I got into the school bus and I found Mitch there already with a seat saved for me. He told me that his family had only recently moved into our neighbourhood and that he could really use a friend to show him around. I went over to his house that evening and his black Labrador, Jagga, greeted me. ‚ÄoeShe loves people.‚Äù, he said and walked up the stairs to where I assumed was his room.

Mitch showed me his closet of clothes and I was stunned, honestly. He had so many varieties of clothes. He told me that clothes shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t conform us to our genders, you know. ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m all about breaking gender stereotypes. Paint my nails, give me your high heels or don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re actually very uncomfortable. But you get the point, Scott.‚Äù I was slowly starting to understand where he came from. ‚ÄoeMitch, I want to do something.‚Äù I think my sly smile gave away what I was thinking and he immediately screamed, ‚ÄoeYES!‚Äù

Mitch and I got out the school bus next morning and all eyes were on us. We heard mumbling, whispering and even screaming but we carried on walking unfazed by everything around us. I was wearing a blue skirt with a yellow top, and a pair of converse shoes. Mitch was wearing a skirt as well; it was black and paired with a blue flannel. He looked great. WE looked great. As we passed by the parking lot, Travis looked at the two of us wide-eyed and I gave him the biggest smile I possibly could. I felt amazing. It felt amazing to break gender stereotypes in whatever little way I could. This is only one of the many things I was going to get to do with Mitch Grassi this year in high school and I honestly couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wait for the rest of the year. ‚ÄoeSee you at lunch, Odd.‚Äù
