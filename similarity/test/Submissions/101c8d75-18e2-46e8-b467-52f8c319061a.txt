They were not sure what had happened. Did such a world really exist? Would anybody ever believe that they had travelled into the nether regions of the Patala-Lok, and returned back alive?

They felt they were in an ethereal vehicle of the gods, which had shown them the Maya of life.

It was a gift from Lord Krishna who had gone down into the earth with them and brought them back to earth. He had made sure that they would not die.

When they re-emerged on earth, they were sure; Krishna had granted them the boon of rebirth. In memory of that moment of redemption, they made a relief painting on the wall of their Bhunga. They built it again, made a conical roof with dry grass, plastered the inside walls with a mixture of clay, cow dung, and ash. Then making small rolls of clay, they made relief sculptures of their experience - inlaid with mirrors, beads, shells and a decorative floral edge. Painted with white lime and touched with dots of vermilion and yellow turmeric.

They had composed the clay work on the wall, in three layers.

The uppermost layer was the moment before the earthquake, the second showed their descent into earth and the third was mount Meru, rising upward and bringing them back to earth.

Only when you looked closer, you realized that it was not the traditional decorative Kutchi relief work on the wall.

It told a story.

Their story of the earthquake...

It was a series of coincidences.

The children were playing outside, under a tree.

The men were away in the fields.

And, the seven women of the same family, were in their Bhunga.

All seven were wearing similar red chunris, black ghaghras, embroidered kanjaris, thick silver anklets, circular gold earrings, huge nose rings tied to a strand of hair, black bead necklaces and enormous ivory bangles on their tiny wrists.

They also had similar tattoo marks on their chins, cheeks, hands and feet, dots, flowers, scorpions, and a little Krishna on the right arm. The only difference was that the women had the names of their respective husbandâ€<sup>TM</sup>s tattooed on the left arm.

The women were sitting on the floor of their kitchen and rolling chapattis, purees and other snacks, in preparation of a pilgrimage to Dwarka. It was a wish fulfillment for each woman. They did not want to reveal the reason of the wish. But, they all looked happy and content. They had received all that they had ever wanted, and were singing a bhajans in praise of Krishna.

Their voices matched, shrill and high, as they sang in unison.

When they first felt something like a wave rising in the womb of the earth, they were worried. Yet, they did not stop singing. Even if their eyes betrayed their worry, they did not express anything. They kept on singing, hoping that the tremor was because of Kaliya, the cobra had swallowed Krishnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s ball; with which he was playing. They were sure that the infant god would jump into the turbulent waters and harness the serpent. And so, they kept on singing in praise of Krishna.

When the utensils fell from the shelves, the kitchen started moving as though it had a life of its own. They sat still and did not move, assuming it was just the magic of Krishnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Lila. They were afraid, but did not look at each other; lest the other read the fear in the others eyes and did not stop the rhythmic movement of their rolling pins.

As the tremors increased, they started sinking into the earth; their hands were still moving in unison; even with the trembling beneath. But, they did not move, as they did not want to disturb Mother Earth.

The earth and their hands seemed to be moving together, to a strange rhythm.

They had transformed into Krishnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Gopis and he was drawing them deeper into the nether-regions. They were sure that Krishna would not allow any harm to come to them. He would save them. Krishna would carry their home on his little finger, in the same way that he had carried Mount Govardhan on the night of the deluge.

They were sure, he would save them.

They had stopped breathing. Perhaps they were already in Dwarka. Soon, they would hear Krishnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s flute.

He would appear, lift their floating kitchen on his little finger and place it back on earth.

It was only when the kitchen stopped its descent into the earth; they realized that something had happened, because the light had changed.

They were not in Dwarka, but in the womb of the earth.

Slowly as they descended into the earth, the light was changing colour.

They could still see each otherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s shadows in the reflected light of the mirror-work on the walls and their blouses.

They had made their own home, the Bhunga, plastering it with clay, decorating the inner walls with traditional relief work, while imbedding mirrors in the clay. They had made creepers, flowers, borders and episodes from Krishnaâ€<sup>TM</sup>s childhood.

They could see each other in the subdued light. It was comforting to be with each other, sitting like birds on a branch, distant, yet united in song.

Something within them, was telling them to continue their song.

Hour after hour, their words and tunes were getting weaker.

If they wanted to live, they knew that they had to keep on singing. Song was their life force.

They were sure, if they stopped singing, they would die.

The army was searching for seven women who had disappeared into the earth. The ground was uneven and the rescue team did not know where to look for them. A wrong move and the women could be hurt. So, they treaded softly on the rubble, used machines to locate them and brought in the sniffer dogs.

Suddenly, one of the machines caught a distant sound.

The dogs stopped there, where the Bhunga had stood; before the earthquake.

Then a sound surfaced on earth, like the tune of a flute, a murmur, a stanza, a verse, a song.

With every possible technical know-how, when the rescue team brought out the women. They had transformed into frozen sculptures, covered with dust, sitting cross legged, rolling pins in hand and singing, dazed, devoted, sublime.
