One day it was here and the next day it wasn't. The messages began to hit by noon. One said: Commiserations. Are you cut up about what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s happening?

Thanks, Lily said. Thanks, I think we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re okay for now.

She felt her heart get louder when she thought about it.

It was still spring, and the tabebuias were still flowering. Today Lily woke to the news that a girl in Uttar Pradesh was raped and set on fire. She tried to make herself feel something, to imagine something to imagine that.

Then the signs began to appear. On the third day, the Metro station near home began to crumble, seemingly of its own accord. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s simply as if it decided it was done being up. Was the city actually made of mud, as that yogi claimed?

That evening the area would darken. The power went out - the government had to divert power to make up for the years of theft, they told us. In the distance the grating of a chainsaw.

Mahima called. She never called. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a fire at the Square. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re burning everything they can find.

They got my guitar, she said. She was gentle because she knew Lily.

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in the fire? All Lily‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breath, punched from her body. She heard the quiet hmm on the other end. Yes.

Mahima and Lily first met at a concert outside the Metro station just before it rained. Mahima to play guitar and sing at an outdoors concert. Her hair was in a scarf. She wore rings on her fingers, lips, ears, left index-toe. This presented challenges for handholding but rendered kissing and fucking newly pleasurable. Steel on back, on stomach. In bed Lily would hum the few ragas she knew for her: Jogkauns, Madhuvanti, Bairagi Bhairav. Lovestruck, anguished songs. Where do you get all this anguish from, Mahima teased her once. But they loved both the register, the songs about lovers separated by rain, distance, cruel mother-in-laws.

Once, with Mahima‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fingers deep inside her, Lily melted, asked her, eyes brimming: will you marry me? Mahima was so tickled by the idea her giggles became contagious: you want to marry me? We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll settle in a 3BHK by the sea? You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be my tour wife? And so on. Between giggles, she said: you could never marry anyone, my love.

 These days Lily settled into bed every night and felt her heart beat harder until she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t remember anything. The single Kurl-on mattress had arched inward in the middle; her back could never find ground. It was 30 degrees at night but the fan was on full blast so she could feel tucked in by her blanket.

When she slept she dreamed of violent boars emerging from an attic to attack her. They always seemed to rush forward at her, rip her skin, and discard her, losing interest while she lay still breathing. Her family fleeing the floods, which had finally reached them. Her mother was always alive.

Then she began to dream about one of the people stabbing Nina while she had to watch. In these dreams they were usually together on their way back from a Metro station or the grocery store. In the most recent dream Lily was in a mall and she locked eyes with her father and bags of shopping she clearly knew was for Rachna, the woman he cheated on Amma with, but she snuck into a long passageway that led to the loo so they could pretend it hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t happened.

The river had become oilier than usual. By day eight there was no clean water. Lily went down to the store and fished out a wrinkled ten-rupee note. It had gone banana-soft from sitting in her wallet for too long, but she was sure Vijay would take it.

Two litres? Vijay said.

Yes.

100.

Huh?

Two litre bottle. Hundred rupees.

Vijay watched her eyes widen.

No cash, she said. Can I come later?

No later, he said. But he handed her the bottle. An old, dusty bottle, green growing in the bottom.

There was a screaming outside near the ATM. A woman had defaulted on a loan and five men had surrounded her, landing occasional blows. She shouted; she was beaten. Watching them spar, Lily wondered what she should do. What she could do. A woman in an orange saree now came up to her and slapped her: why are you standing alone here? Lily returned to her flat, wheezing from carrying the two litres up three flights of stairs.

By the eighth day her heart had broken out in a sweat. Please don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go out, Nina told her. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re everywhere. Her friend Shruti wore a skirt while she walked to the medical store and word was that two men had grabbed her and raped her. There‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no lighting in that lane, what was she doing? Nina messaged her that morning. As if she should know.

By day sixteen no music was allowed at all. Every instrument they could find was burned. It was Mahima‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s birthday and Lily had planned to take her to the lake, before all this started. Now, in her head, Lily sang Jiyara mora pyaara, Jogkauns, and stopped when she could not remember the words of the second line. Mahima came home early.

The moment she looked at her she knew. She had a song. Mahima was hushed, fearful, her eyes slightly wider than usual.

I wrote this, she says, pulling some chord sheets from her bag.

What the hell have you done? Get it out of sight before anyone sees.

I know. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll go down for this.

The fuck are you doing? You know we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not supposed to be singing. Let alone singing about - Lily glanced at the lyrics - my mons pubis.

But I wrote it after last night.

Lily paused and looked up at her. Last night after dinner they walked and held hands. The bougainvillea from that house spilled on to the walls. Jasmine flowers fell from a tree. They found someone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parked bike to sit on and spoke and sat in silence. Then they came home and fucked, for hours and hours and hours. Quietly because they expected them to knock any time now.

Brandi Carlile is playing, singing about her wife. Today I sang the same damn tune as you. Someone rings the bell. Thrice in the time it takes her to take off her earphones.

They have already knocked. It has to be a man. The ringing bell reminds Lily of her father.

Lily is wrong. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a woman. Her sari is brown. ‚ÄoeCome in,‚Äù she gestures to a sudden mass of people behind her, and they are upon her.
