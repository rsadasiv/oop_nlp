*The Mirror* 

The window disappeared each night. We were three months into our marriage. Afraid that one of those towering nights the walls would close in on Meer and me, perishing us, I would often rise up to unlatch the disappearing window. The room shrank progressively and a squarish frame of walls guarded our bed. The Mirror is the only visible detail I remember. The Mirror. Us inside the Mirror. Each night around half past four, Meer would fall asleep. Upon sunrise, I noticed that the room had expanded back to its original size and all its minute details were blazing vehemently. The trail of lemongrass oil, the volumes of Urdu poetry inherited from my father, the flags we picked on our honeymoon, the laptop- a wedding present from my brother and the singular window in the far left corner. 

We had a very happy marriage, anyone would tell, from the way Meer called my name out in public. ‚ÄoeInaam‚Äù, he would say it with the piety of a Maulvi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tongue. That was the reason I married Meer. The beauty with which he called my name was rare. My soul would flap upon hearing it. My heart would unfurl like a flytrap swallowing the nuanced rhythm of his speech. ‚ÄoeAh! The deliciousness with which he calls my name, *Ammi!* I could be his wife for a million lifetimes‚Äù, I would tell my mother. Sometimes I would repeat our names to myself as if I were chanting them ‚Ä" ‚ÄoeMeer! Inaam! Inaam! Meer! Inaam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Meer! Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Inaam!‚Äù 

The truth of our professedly happy marriage though, was a secret. It was a tight secret between the three of us - Meer, myself and the Mirror. The Mirror, it witnessed everything. Everything from our unblemished virginal days to the last few days we spent in that room.While we were together, we colour co-ordinated our clothes... the Mirror and I. Oh! The roaring laughter we shared the day I toppled down in my sky-high stilettos!  Star shaped stickers pasted on my breasts I was hopping and bouncing like the strippers we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d seen on our honeymoon. The stickers looked odd on me. They seemed surprisingly small. The sweat on my skin made them peel off a little. How funny I must have looked‚Ä¶ wearing an expression of feigned ecstasy, imagining myself a sea-nymph, when at once, my body capitulated to a nosedive. A loud thump, and I lost my stars. Thankfully, Meer wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there. It was just the two of us and a laughter that arose straight from the insides of our souls. That was the day I led the Mirror into my plan of Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s seduction. 

The first few days of my marriage I was artless enough to think prayers would resolve Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s disinterest in me. So I tried praying Meer into consummation. It didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work. I then took on tricks the old-fashioned courtesans used. Hints of jasmine and a few subtle, inviting gestures. I would sing sometimes as well. When these too failed to draw Meer toward me, I resorted to overt provocation. Meer loved the porn girls. They were his type. I trained myself persistently into becoming like them. The Mirror was my teacher. Each morning, I would replay the videos Meer had seen the previous night and try out all the titillating moves the porn girls made. Some of them involved elaborate setups ‚Ä" swings, handcuffs, Ping-Pong balls, whips, ropes, arrows and strange bedroom paraphernalia. The Ping-Pong balls were undeniably gratifying. Even though I had nothing of the dexterity of Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s porn-stars those tiny balls invigorated me. 

When I walked boldly out of the bathroom in a corselette one night, Meer seemed captivated by my mien. I began swirling, slowly and self-consciously at first, but rapidly bit by bit. I did unimaginable things with my body that night - skipping, prancing, thrusting and discovering a language of skin and flesh I had never known. Meer gazed at me unabatingly. Something surged inside me. In keeping with the sequence I was aping, I turned to undoing the corselette. It was then that I realized the merry widow was a size too small. The Mirror grew agitated. My limbs were mortified. Some trembling  part of me felt unsheltered and uncomfortable. My mind clambered to help me  and I reached for scissors in the drawer, pretending I had planned this all along. As I cut open the lace in the front, untidy clumps of my middle spilled out hurriedly, entertaining Meer, who broke into a cacophonous laughter. 

The nights thereafter were overpowering. The Mirror stared at us with commiseration. The walls contracted. I would lie quiet on the wall-end of the bed, Meer on the extreme corner of the open end, the laptop on his thighs. The screen was clearly visible from where I lay. I wondered if they could see me too. They were beautiful- the porn girls. Their eyes were seething with a lust that could ravage multitudes. Their movement was as supple as music. They were spotless, clean, sparkling, brimming with skill. They were charged with a strange magnetic force ‚Ä" an illuminated self-assurance. Sometimes, Meer would speak with them too. Not one but many of them. He would never call out their names though, as he called out mine. It was merely dirty talk. Over time, I became a detached observer studying the intersections between Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mind, his body and porn. Meer grew more and more distant as I observed with scientific objectivity how he fondled himself. To me, Meer was the unattainable. To Meer, I was a mere eavesdropper. 

The next few days I turned my face to the wall until he went to sleep. The Mirror wore an unfailing expression of derision. Then suddenly one night, I felt my arm instinctually reach out for his body. In no time Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s body was drumming against my own. Could this have been so painless? Questions darted themselves at me but faded in the fumes of our vigour. Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s flesh was heavy upon mine. The Mirror was weeping. I could see the lines of his torso inside it. A shifting glimpse of anticipated ecstasy on my own face entreated the Mirror to stop crying. I could see the porn girl on the laptop screen too. She was breath-taking; pure as an angel from heaven. Her valiant eyes were large and locked with my husband‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gaze. His hands were on the keyboard as he propped his body over mine. Just behind my head was the corroboration of Meer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s infinite acts of infidelity. 

The walls closed in on each other that night, squashing everything in the room. The window frame faded into the clouds. The bed became a sole straight line. Everything in the room coalesced into one. The distance between Meer and me was the only thing that expanded, stretching into boundless yards of an aching night sky. The Mirror evanesced, studding that distance, with the faint sparkle of starlight.
