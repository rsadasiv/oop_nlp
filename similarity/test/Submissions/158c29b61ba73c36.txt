*Cherchons la femme* 

The circular room was devoid of furniture. There was a square jute mat rolled up by a corner. She spread the mat and sat herself down in the middle of the room. She looked around calmly, cataloguing the pictures hung around the walls. Every picture was the size of the mat she sat on. They hung around the walls. They lined the ceiling and the floor. Her feet hurt today, so she couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get the details at her eyes skimmed through the colours and characters. Some pictures were paintings and some, photographs. Some pictures had people and animals in them, and some, were entirely landscape. She held her right foot across her left knee and massaged it with both her hands. Light poured in from the three square stained glasses on the ceiling. After a while of being seated, she felt tired and wanted to lie on a bed. She looked around her searching for a painting with a bed in it. She found it directly behind her. The bed looked regal and cosy. It looked like the mattress would bounce up and down if one jumped on it. The sheets were sky blue satin and the pillows a magnificent clean white. Her eyes lit up excitedly as she imagined herself between those cool covers. She could almost feel the TV remote in her hand as she lazily turned on the flat screen TV on the wooden panelling in front of her. She stood on the mat wondering how to get to that picture. Her pathway was filled with other pictures she currently had no interest in. She would have to be very careful. She began to tip toe and leap between pictures. She had jumped across ten pictures when her calves began to hurt a little. She looked at the expanse of pictures in front of her and recalibrated her path. The bed seemed cosier and a fire place had appeared. A window opened, letting in cold air and flecks of snow. Her feet stood precariously between two paintings. Her eyes began to dry from lack of blinking. She was tired. She knew she was going to fall. She saw it coming. She took two more steps forward and looked wistfully at the bed just three more steps away. Then, she let go. In the few seconds before falling, she had glimpsed the two paintings on either side. She was standing too close to them to know if she liked any painting at all. One painting was that of a garden, with jasmine trees and creepers around steel arches. A ladybug had stood out, tantalising her to touch its shiny red exoskeleton. The other picture was that of a factory, with two large cooling towers in full view. The offices were of blue glass that glinted in bright sunlight. Tiny people were visible on the ground and on the helipad at the top of the office building. Since she was falling, she thought, she might as well as get some fresh air. She could keep pollution for later. The garden smelt of petrichor. Her hair felt soft and her feet were bare. Her mother was calling her in for dinner. She liked this painting. She picked jasmine flowers and braided them with leafless stem threads from creepers that she pulled out from the arches. They put up a fight, clinging on to each other. Some of them had thorns that cut her palms. But she persisted. After dinner, she nervously stood outside her room. Would her bed look like the one in the painting? She gently pushed the door open. Her lips pursed flatly to one side of her face. The bed was wooden and small. The mattress looked hard and the sole pillow that occupied the head of the bed did not look inviting. She suspected that she would awake the next day with neck ache. She found herself coiled on the mat in the circular room. She located the picture of the bed and retraced the path to it. Her limbs hurt from sleeping badly and her resolve to get to the bed she needed had grown stronger. She dragged herself carefully across the room. Her legs felt paralysed. She tried to avoid falling into any picture. They watched her go by, unaccustomed to being at such close quarters to anything but her feet. An old man smoking a beedi emerged from a black and white photograph with a walking stick. He took hold of her neck with the curve of the stick and dragged her down. The bed on the far side of the wall looked more enticing than ever. She breathed in deeply and clung on the frame for three seconds before she landed in water. She stayed under water for some time. She felt too heavy to move. The water in her ears soothed her. She did not need them to work for the time being in giving her balance. She closed her eyes and let her arms and legs go. Slowly, she floated up to the surface. She bobbed up and down for a few more seconds. The old man was seated on a low wall by the bank of the lake. He was frail and hunched over, his ribs visible from a distance. He sat facing away from her. He seemed to be tending to cattle. She swam slowly towards him and dragged litres of water on her body as she stood on her feet and walked away from the lake. Such magnificent cows and bulls she had never laid eyes on. They were beautiful. Their eyes spoke of untold intelligence. Their bodies were muscular and their hide shone. Their ears were upright and a ring had been pierced through one. She sat next to the old man, dripping and shivering. He handed her a new beedi and a matchbox. Her shivering hands grasped the slim cylindrical paper roll and held it to her lips. She lit a match and then the beedi. She breathed in warm tar and felt better. A calf teased another calf, rather violently. The mothers separated them with their muzzles. But one calf was persistent. It hit the other in its face. The mothers snorted and drew battle lines. The girl on the low wall by the bank turned to find the old man removing another beedi from a fold in his dhoti. She tried to speak but her larynx did not seem to work. Then she realised it was really quiet. She couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hear the cows. She could see them, evidently and smell their dung. But she was mute and deaf. Her brow creased in concentration. She flailed her arms at the old man and he looked up at her lazily. Bulls were fighting now and they had locked horns. Chaos had established itself, not five metres away from where the humans sat. She hastily crouched behind the wall. The old man did not move. He was creating shapes in the air and pointing them out to her. The bulls charged at each other. The mightier began to chase the weaker and the herd started to run towards the wall. They brought her half down. They trampled over the loose stones and left her buried in the mud. The old man took out a small box of tobacco powder. He did not find his visitor so he busied himself rubbing pinches up his nose and into his teeth. She sobbed herself awake on her blood stained mat. She suspected that she had cracked a few bones, at least by a hairline. But she could stand up and hold herself together. She began to sprint towards the bed; time seemed to be important suddenly. She touched the painting when she reached it expecting to be drawn in. It was two dimensional and she remained in the circular room. She looked around her, confused. She looked at a painting on the floor. The images moved ever so subtly, adding colour and volume to the picture, making it almost imperceptibly three dimensional. Then she looked at the picture of her beloved bed, it was flat. Admittedly, it was beautiful, but in comparison, it looked inanimate. Her fists pounded on the flat painting. She could feel the slight curve of the wall behind it. She tried to pull it down. The frame hung strong. All the sharp stationary from the room suddenly disappeared, as she searched desperately. The room darkened to match the expression on her face. Dramatic as it was, the stained glass on the ceiling threw light on the sole desk that was appearing in the centre of the room. It had been sometime since it had visited. She turned around, defiant, daring the table to disappear, like it had the last time. Her incomplete painting teased her from the white marble top. She stood against the picture of her bed, unmoving. The table grew marble roots slowly and drove them into the floor. It was making a point. She fell asleep awkwardly, drooling on the decadent frame. She jolted back into consciousness, aware that her hope of falling into the painting while in deep sleep had not come to fruition. The room was dark now, with dim light from the stained glass ebbing and reappearing at irregular intervals. The room was taunting her. She dragged her feet to the table. A chair replaced the mat, as she had known it would. Leather restraints sprouted forth from the seat of the chair and wrapped themselves around her thighs. Her eyes welled with tears. She wiped them. She picked up a paint brush from the enormous set on the table. The rest of the room disappeared into oblivion. She began to paint. Today she used water colours. She had been painting a little boy, perhaps from memory, the last time the table had imposed itself. Her relationship with the table had begun gently. She had willed it to appear, needing an activity to keep her occupied in her hours alone. Her first painting had been a doll. She had painted the doll when she was very young. She couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t find that picture anymore. A carpentry set had first been presented to her. Her nimble fingers had the dexterity to carve minute details into wood. But she hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t been able to hammer the pieces together. So the room provided the frames already made. She spent hours coaxing her canvases onto the frame. The painting of the doll she had held on to dearly. She had painted a special purple square on an otherwise dull wall and hammered a nail onto it. She had gingerly hung the frame on it. The features on the boyâ€<sup>TM</sup>s face began to gain detailing. She carefully drew strokes of grease on his cheeks and hair. A white shirt it might have been once, but now it was ash grey. Without warning, her torso was sucked into the painting. The boy was kicking her. He held her face and began to slap it with his small hardened palms. She shrieked and tried to pull back. His fist cut her lip on her teeth. Her tongue took a beating as she licked the droplet of blood. She took hold of his swift hands and held them down, careful not to apply too much force on his little limbs. Why are you hurting me? He pointed at his plate of food on the pavement she had drawn carefully. That is not how my mother cuts my vegetables. That is not how I remember it. It is so frustrating that I have to eat them tiny and straight like that every day! I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t felt full in months! Blood rushed through his arms to his hands and he began to resist her grip. She gaped at him, unbelievingly. Her grip loosened and he caught hold of her head and began shaking it vigorously. It almost felt good. But she calmly removed his hands from her hair and met his eyes. I will redraw the vegetables. Describe how your mother cut them to me. Back in her room, she meticulously redrew the contents of her subjectâ€<sup>TM</sup>s plate. She did not want to have to go back to this painting, so she rolled it up and let it join her other neglected canvases in a basket under the table. She had finished her painting. She expected the chair to let her go. Her eyes subconsciously looked behind her to check if the painting of her beloved bed was still completely inanimate. The buckles on the leather belt stayed fastened. A camera appeared on the table. It drew attention to itself by turning on. The lens adjusted itself. It set itself to auto mode and turned off the digital viewing screen. She was tired and her eyes hurt. She couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t open her mouth completely from the pain and her neck ache came back dull and persistent. She tried to fall asleep upright on her chair. The room shook her awake. Paintings came off walls and the stained glass on the ceiling threatened to fall on her. She picked the camera up and peered into it. It was dark, nothing was visible. She waited. The only picture she could summon was the bed. The sheets had been changed. A floral quilt was spread over the sheets.  The sides were tucked under the mattress. Her shoulders shook involuntarily and her lips quivered. She clicked the picture and it appeared on a canvas behind the table. She waited expectantly. She had finished what was asked of her. There was even a dog sleeping in a basket by the side of the bed. It was new, imaginative. Fire engulfed the painting and the smell of oil and canvas burning alongside wood became overpowering. A river of tears ran down her blood drained face.  She would have to live with ash in her lungs for a few days. The room made no attempt to clean it. The light through the stained glass was now dull and grey. The playful colours disappeared. She stopped feeling her legs. She fell asleep now and again, only to be shaken awake. She repeatedly picked up the camera in hope of taking a more satisfactory picture. The dog only changed positions in sleep, and sometimes, he was to be found eating out of a bowl. She hoped to glimpse a human being, perhaps, but she did not. Slowly, the picture began to lose details. The bed lost its appeal. The windows lost paint. She couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t tell if it was snowing outside or sunny. She fell asleep with the camera stuck to her face. The room did not move. When she awoke, she was on the mat again. The table was gone and in front of her stood, a framed photograph of, nothing. It looked like a square black board. She stealthily searched for the picture of her bed. She could not find it sitting down so she stood up. The black photo rose with her. Wherever she tried to look, it followed. She took a step towards the wall and the blackness took a step towards her. She jumped into the picture closest to her. 

She stuffed a sock with wads of freshly minted rupee notes. She placed a bar code printed on a sticker on the sock and scanned it onto her computer. She showed the sock to her clients, frazzled looking siblings who held their hands together on the other side on her table, who nodded. She let the sock drop into a laundry chute next to the window.
