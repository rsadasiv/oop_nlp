James Beresford (28 May 1764 â€" 29 September 1840) was a writer and clergyman. He was born in Upham in Hampshire and educated at Charterhouse School and became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford. He made translations and wrote religious books, but was chiefly known as the author of a satirical work, The Miseries of Human Life, considered to be a "minor classic in the genre".[1] He was rector of Kibworth from 1812 until his death.

This list of works is taken from Beresford's obituary, published in the May 1841 edition of The Gentleman's Magazine.[2]
