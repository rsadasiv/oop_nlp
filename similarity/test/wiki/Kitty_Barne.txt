Marion Catherine "Kitty" Barne (17 November 1882 â€" 3 February 1961[1][2]) was a British screenwriter and author of children's books, especially on music and musical themes.[3] She won the 1940 Carnegie Medal for British children's books.[4]

She was born in Petersham, Surrey, but was brought up in Somerset and Sussex, and later studied at the Royal College of Music.  On 12 April 1912, in Eastbourne, she married Eric Streatfeild, thus becoming the cousin-in-law of another popular children's writer Noel Streatfeild.[3][5][6]  Eric Streatfeild was the first cousin of Noel Streatfeild's father.

Barne was a member of the Women's Voluntary Service, responsible for the reception of children evacuated to Sussex.  During the war years, she published six novels,[6] most notably Visitors from London about evacuees (J. M. Dent, 1940). For that work she won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.[1][4] 

She is possibly best known now for her pony books Rosina Copper and its sequel Rosina and Son, about the true story of an Argentine polo pony mare that was rescued from neglect after being ordered to be killed.[7][8] They were illustrated by Alfons Purtscher and Marcia Lane Foster respectively.

Apart from her novels, she wrote some non-fiction books, including a biography of Elizabeth Fry (who was her husband's great grandmother) in 1950,[9] a book about the orchestra and a history of the Girl Guides.  She was the Girl Guides "Commissioner for Music and Drama" for some years.[2]

Ruth Gervis, the illustrator of a number of her books, said of her:

She died on 3 February 1961 after a long illness.[2]
