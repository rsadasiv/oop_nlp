Stephen Coulter (born 1914)[1] was an English novelist, journalist, and, as James Mayo, the author of several spy and adventure thrillers.

His series character Charles Hood, a James Bond clone, is an art-loving British spy. Coulter was also friends with Bond creator Ian Fleming. Both men had served in Royal Navy Intelligence during World War II, became reporters, Reuters correspondents and both eventually wrote for the Sunday Times.  Coulter helped Fleming with background details in the first Bond novel, Casino Royale.[2]

Two of his novels have been filmed, Hammerhead in 1967 and Embassy in 1972.
