Andrew Burnaby (16 August 1732 â€" 9 March 1812) was an English yuhan and travel writer.

He was born in Asfordby, Leicestershire,[1] on 16 August 1732,[2] the eldest son and namesake of the Reverend Andrew Burnaby, a well-to-do clergyman of the Church of England. The younger Burnaby attended Westminster School, and then Queens' College, Cambridge, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1754 and his master's degree in 1757. After taking his B.A., he was ordained.[3]

Shortly afterward he toured America, a trip which he later wrote up as a celebrated travelogue Travels Through the Middle Settlements in North America, In the Years 1759 and 1760, which was published in 1775, and again in an enlarged form in 1798. His book avoids all mention of the major political developments of the time, such as the American Revolution. After his return to Europe, he became Chaplain to the British mission at Leghorn in 1762. He was posted there for about 5 years, rising to become Proconsul (but actually doing the job of Consul) until his eventual resignation and return to England, where he was appointed vicar at Greenwich, Kent, from 1769. He wrote an account of his travels in Corsica and Italy in 1804, but this only ran to a few copies.[1]

He was made Doctor of Divinity[3] and Professor of Sacred Theology[4] at the University of Cambridge in 1776. He married Anne Edwyn, daughter and heiress of John Edwyn of Baggrave Hall, Leicestershire, on 26 February 1770 at St George's, Hanover Square, London.[5] This renewed his Leicestershire connection and he was made Archdeacon of Leicester in 1786. He died on 9 March 1812 at Blackheath, Kent, and was buried at Hungarton in Leicestershire.[6]

Anne Edwyn was baptised on 15 October 1735 at Hungarton, Leicestershire,[5] and died just a few days after her husband on either 16[4] or 19[1][6] March 1812.
