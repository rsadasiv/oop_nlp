William Andrew Chatto (1799â€"1864) was an English writer. He used the pseudonym Stephen Oliver (Junior).

The only son of William Chatto, a merchant who died at Gibraltar in 1804, was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 17 April 1799. After education at a grammar school in the north, he went into business, and around 1830 acquired the firm of his cousin, a wholesale tea-dealer, in Eastcheap, London. In 1834 he gave up business to write.[1] Also in this year, he acquired, probably from the Atkinson family, the Henry Atkinson manuscript, an important early source of violin music, dating from the 1690s, and written in or near Newcastle.

He was editor in 1839â€"41 of the New Sporting Magazine, and in 1844 projected a penny daily comic illustrated paper entitled: Puck, a journalette of Fun. For this paper, which he edited himself, he secured the services of contributors including Tom Taylor, but it had only a brief existence.[1]

In 1839, Chatto was elected an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-on-Tyne. He died in the London Charterhouse, 28 February 1864, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. His epitaph, by his lifelong friend, Tom Taylor, described him as a "true-hearted and upright man".[1]
