Margaret Bingham, Countess of Lucan (1740 ‚Ä" 27 February 1814[1]) was a British painter, copyist, and poet. Her art was much admired by Horace Walpole.

Margaret Bingham was born Margaret Smyth in Devon, England, the younger of the two daughters of James Smith MP of Canons-Leigh, Devon, and his wife Grace.[1][2] She married Charles Bingham, later 1st Earl of Lucan, in 1760.[1] She died in 1814 at St James's Place in London,[1][2] and was survived by five children.[1]

As an artist, Bingham often copied the work of others, as well as painting portrait miniatures.[1][2] Her work was collected in the United Kingdom and in France. In Paris she was given access to the Palais-Royal to copy works of the artists on display there, which were owned by the Duke of Orl√©ans. Her foremost work was to supply miniatures and illuminations for a five-volume edition of Shakespeare's historical plays, for the library at Althorp, Northamptonshire. This took 16 years to complete. She also painted portraits, still lifes, and landscapes.

She was greatly admired by Horace Walpole and there are several flattering allusions to her in his letters. In his Anecdotes Walpole attributes to her "a genius that almost depreciates those masters [from whom she copied,] when we consider that they spent their lives in attaining perfection."[1]

As a writer Lady Lucan published around 1778 Verses on the Present State of Ireland, a strong poetic protest against Britain's treatment of Ireland. It was published in Dublin under the pseudonym Lady L‚Ä"n.[2]
