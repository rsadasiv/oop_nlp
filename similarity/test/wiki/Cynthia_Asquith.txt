Lady Cynthia Mary Evelyn Asquith (n√©e Charteris; 27 September 1887 ‚Ä" 31 March 1960) was an English writer and socialite, now known for her ghost stories and diaries.[1] She also wrote novels and edited a number of anthologies, as well as writing for children and on the British Royal family.

Her father was Hugo Richard Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857‚Ä"1937) and her mother Mary Constance Wyndham (see The Souls). She married Herbert Asquith (son of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister, with whom he is sometimes confused) in 1910.

In 1913, she met D. H. Lawrence in Margate, and became a friend and correspondent.[2] She took a position as secretary to Peter Pan creator J. M. Barrie,[3][4] with whom she became close friends, continuing to work for him until his death in 1937. Barrie left the bulk of his estate to her ‚Ä" minus the Peter Pan works.[5] Author L. P. Hartley became a lifelong friend after they met in the early 1920s.

Asquith became known for editing The Ghost Book, an anthology of supernatural fiction that included work by D.H. Lawrence, Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Oliver Onions, and May Sinclair.[6]

One of Asquith's stories, "The Follower", was adapted for BBC Radio, along with stories by Algernon Blackwood, Marjorie Bowen, and Noel Streatfeild; all these stories were later reprinted in the Cecil Madden anthology My Grimmest Nightmare (1935).[1]

In addition to her literary work, Asquith contributed to the screenplay of the 1937 film Dreaming Lips starring Elisabeth Bergner.[7]

"God Grante That She Lye Stille," collected in When Churchyards Yawn, was adapted in 1961 by Robert Hardy Andrews as an episode of the anthology TV series Thriller.[8]
