Thomas Amory (1691(?) â€" 25 November 1788) was a writer of Irish descent.

In 1755 he published Memoirs containing the lives of several ladies of Great Britain, a History of Antiquities and Observations on the Christian Religion, which was followed by the Life of John Buncle, Esq. (Vol. I,[1] 1756, and Vol. II,[2] 1766), practically a continuation. The contents of these works are miscellaneousâ€"philology, natural science, theology, and much besides, treated without any system, but with occasional originality and felicity of diction. The author, who was a renowned eccentric, had a peculiar aspect, with the manner of a gentleman, and scarcely ever stirred abroad except at dusk. He reached the age of 97.
