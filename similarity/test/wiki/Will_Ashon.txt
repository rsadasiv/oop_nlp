Will Ashon (born 1969) is an English writer and novelist, former music journalist and founder of the Big Dada imprint of Ninja Tune records.[1] 

Ashon was educated at Countesthorpe Community College and Balliol College, Oxford.[1] In the mid-1990s he worked as a music journalist specialising in hip hop for publications including Trace, Muzik and Hip Hop Connection.[2] In 1997 he started the record label Big Dada Recordings in conjunction with Ninja Tune, signing and releasing albums by artists including Roots Manuva, Diplo, Speech Debelle and Wiley.[2]

He published two novels with Faber and Faber, Clear Water (2006)[3] and The Heritage (2008)[4] and a work of non-fiction with Granta, Strange Labyrinth, in 2017[5], "an anarchic hymn to the scruffy edgeland of Epping Forest"[6]. He left Big Dada in February 2014[7], but his new book, due out November 2018, is a return to hip hop - a "genre defying"[8] book about the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album entitled Chamber Music: Enter the Wu-Tang (in 36 Pieces)[9].
