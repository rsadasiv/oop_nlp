Paul Victor Ableman (13 June 1927 ‚Ä" 25 October 2006) was an English playwright and novelist. He was the writer of much erotic fiction and novelisations, and a freelance writer who turned his hand to non-fiction.

Ableman was born in Leeds, Yorkshire to a Jewish family. He was the son of Jack Ableman, a trouser cutter at a tailoring factory, and Gertrude (n√©e Gould), an actress and writer.
[1] Following his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother and stepfather, Thurston B. Macauley, a journalist (sometime London correspondent for the New York Times)[2] in New York. After National Service in the Education Corps based in Gibraltar, he read English at King's College, London, but did not take a degree.[3][4]

His experimental novel, I Hear Voices, was published in 1958 by the Olympia Press, and his plays include Green Julia (1966), a witty two-hander in which two young men discuss an absent mistress, and Tests (1966), which collects surreal playlets written for Peter Brook's Theatre of Cruelty.[5]

Ableman lived in Hampstead, London in the United Kingdom. He was married twice: first to Tina Carrs-Brown in 1958- they had one son, then divorced; then to Sheila Hutton-Fox in 1978 until his death in 2006- they had one son.

Ableman was of Russian ancestry on his father's side and German on his mother's side.
