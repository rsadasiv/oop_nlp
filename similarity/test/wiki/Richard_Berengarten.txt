In 2004, Berengarten's first book of selected writings 'For the Living' includes the award-winning poems 'The Rose of Sharon' (Keats Memorial Prize) and 'In Memory of George Seferis I' (Duncan Lawrie Prize).[9]

Berengarten's 'Balkan Trilogy': The Blue Butterfly (2006), In A Time of Drought (2006); and Under Balkan Light (2008) has won international recognition, the first receiving the Wingate Prize,[10] and the second receiving the Morava International Poetry Prize.[11] The Blue Butterfly takes as its starting point, a Nazi massacre on 21 October 1941 in Kragujevac in the former Yugoslavia. Richard Berengarten visited the site and the memorial museum in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on the forefinger of his writing hand. The resulting work is powerful, examining themes of revenge and forgiveness from the historical context to the present time. He was made an honorary citizen of Kragujevac in 2012,[5] and the title poem is well known in the former Yugoslavia through the translation by Danilo Ki≈° and Ivan V. Lalic.[10]


Richard Berengarten's perspectives as a poet combine British, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. On his own work Berengarten says: "I would rather think of myself as a European poet who writes in English than as an 'English' poet."[9][12]
Berengarten is a popular reader of his own poetry, and a dynamic teacher.
