Charles Burney, Junior FRS, DD (born at Lynn Regis, Norfolk on 4 December 1757, died at Deptford, then part of Kent, on 28 December 1817) was an English classical scholar, schoolmaster and clergyman.

A native of London, he was the son of Charles Burney, a music historian, and his first wife, Esther Sleepe. He was a brother of the novelist and diarist Fanny Burney and the explorer James Burney, and a half-brother of the novelist Sarah Burney.

Burney was educated at Charterhouse School, London, and then at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. However, he was accused of stealing books from the university library, probably to pay debts, and sent down in 1778. He obtained an LLD degree from King's College, Aberdeen in 1781. Ironically, Burney later amassed legally a collection of 13,000 rare books and manuscripts, which was ultimately bought by the nation for the British Museum in 1817 for the sum of Â£13,500. Today, the Burney Collection belongs to the British Library.

In 1782, Burney became a master at a private school in Chiswick run by William Rose. He married Rose's daughter Sarah (1759â€"1821) in 1783. When Rose died in 1786, Burney took over the school, moving it to nearby Hammersmith and thence to Greenwich in 1793.

Many eminent naval and military officers were educated there, but he seems to have been such a strong disciplinarian that he provoked a rebellion of about 50 boys at some time in the early years of the 19th century. One boy described it in an undated letter to his mother. The boys took food, chessboards, cards and weapons, and barricaded themselves in: "Then Burney came and told them to open the door but they said it was not shut to be opened. He then got a ladder & got at the top of the door where he could see them all... till at last as the door was going to be cut open they unfastened it, when Burney rushed in. At first they hit him with their sticks but he knocked them about till at last they were quiet & Burney very generously gave them the choice of being expelled or forgiven; above 40 were forgiven and 2 expelled."[1]

Burney transferred the school to his only child Charles Parr Burney (1785â€"1864), who ran it from 1813 to 1833.

Burney gained a strong reputation as a Greek scholar with several publications. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1802. He made his peace with Cambridge University, which awarded him an MA in 1808 on his ordination as an Anglican priest. He advanced rapidly in the Church of England, becoming rector of the rich living of Cliffe, Kent, and of St. Paul's, Deptford, as well as serving as a royal chaplain and a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral. He died of apoplexy, aged sixty.
