He is known for his work alongside Rob Newman in The Mary Whitehouse Experience and partnership with Frank Skinner. Besides comedy, Baddiel is also a published novelist and a screenwriter[1] who is the author of the children's novels The Parent Agency, The Person Controller, AniMalcolm and Birthday Boy.

Baddiel was born in Troy, New York, and moved to England with his parents when he was four months old.[2] His father, Colin Brian Baddiel, was Welsh-born from a working class background and worked as a research chemist with Unilever before being made redundant in the 1980s, after which he sold Dinky Toys at Grays Antique Market.

His mother, Sarah, was German-born. She died in 2014,[3] was a five-month-old refugee child when she was brought to the United Kingdom in 1939 by her parents after escaping from Nazi Germany, where her father, Ernst, had been stripped of his assets. Soon after their arrival,  Ernst was interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man for a year.[4][5] Baddiel is the second of three sons.[6] His parents were both from  Jewish families.[7]

Baddiel grew up in Dollis Hill, Willesden, north London. He attended primary school at the North West London Jewish Day School in Brent.[8] After studying at The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Elstree, an independent school near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, he studied English at King's College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, and graduated with a double first.[9][8] He began studies for a PhD in English at University College London but did not complete it.[6]

After leaving university, Baddiel became a professional stand-up comedian in London, as well as a writer for acts including Rory Bremner and series including Spitting Image. His first television appearance came in one episode of the showbiz satire, Filthy, Rich and Catflap. In 1988, he was introduced to Rob Newman, and the two formed a writing partnership. Subsequently, paired up with Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis another comedy duo, they began writing and performing in The Mary Whitehouse Experience, on BBC Radio 1 where the show ran for four series and a special. This success led the show to transfer to BBC2 where it ran for two series, after which both duos decided to end the show. During this time, Baddiel also co-hosted the Channel 4 programme, A Stab in the Dark.

Once The Mary Whitehouse Experience had concluded, Baddiel and Newman decided to once again team up for Newman and Baddiel in Pieces which ran for seven episodes on BBC2 featuring character sketches, as well monologues and observation routines. Despite a tense working relationship, the show saw Newman and Baddiel find enormous success as live performers, held up as examples of comedy as ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>the new Rock‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>n‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Roll‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, with their tour (Newman and Baddiel: Live and In Pieces) culminating in the first-ever sold-out gig for a comedy act at Wembley Arena, playing to 12,500 people.[10] Despite this success, increasing tension between the pair led to them announcing that the tour would be their last. Their final tour was also the subject of a BBC2 documentary, Newman and Baddiel on the Road to Wembley.

Baddiel subsequently met and began sharing a flat with fellow comedian Frank Skinner. Both lifelong football fans, the pair created, wrote and performed Fantasy Football League, a popular entertainment show based on the growing fantasy football craze. Running for three series on BBC2, followed by a series of live specials throughout the 1998 World Cup and then again through the 2004 European Championship, as well as a series of podcasts for The Times from Germany at the 2006 World Cup, and another series for Absolute Radio from South Africa during the 2010 World Cup (amassing over 3 million downloads). During this time the duo also twice topped the UK Singles Chart with the football anthem "Three Lions", co-written and performed with The Lightning Seeds. The song was originally written as the England football team's official anthem for UEFA Euro 1996 and was subsequently re-recorded with updated lyrics as the unofficial anthem for the 1998 World Cup.

After ending Fantasy Football League, the pair took an improvised question-and-answer show to the Edinburgh Fringe which then became a television series, Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, which ran for five series on ITV, as well as a West End run at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 2001.

His father is from Swansea[9] and his mother was born in Nazi Germany, a swastika appearing on her birth certificate.[25] An episode of the BBC's genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? investigated his heritage in some detail,[25] but failed to prove his theory that his mother had been secretly adopted from another Jewish family who had no hope of escaping.[5] Despite his upbringing, he has described himself as a "10 out of 10 atheist"[26] and as a "fundamentalist" "Jewish atheist".[1]
