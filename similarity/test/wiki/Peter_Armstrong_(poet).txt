Peter Armstrong (born in 1957 in Blaydon, County Durham, England) is a poet and psychotherapist.

Armstrong was educated at local schools and then read philosophy and English at Sunderland Polytechnic (now the University of Sunderland). While at polytechnic, he was converted from Roman Catholicism to Evangelical Protestantism, but more recently has described himself as an "Anglo-Catholic agnostic". He trained as a teacher but then turned to psychiatric nursing, and now works as a cognitive behavioural psychotherapist.[1] He lives in Stocksfield, Northumberland.[2]

Armstrong began to publish his poetry in the late 1970s, contributing to magazines and to Ten North-East Poets,[3] The Firebox. Poetry in Britain and Ireland after 1945,[4] and Last Words: New Poetry for the New Century,[5] and other collections. He won an Eric Gregory Award from the Society of Authors in 1984. His first volume of poetry, Risings, appeared in 1988 and has been followed by three others.[6]

Armstrong is one of the editors of the Newcastle-based magazine Other Poetry, which was revived in 1995 and appears three times a year. He is also a member of the Northern Poets' Workshop. His work is marked by joint preoccupations with religion and the landscape---of his native North-East, but also of the Hebrides and of a notional American drawn from road movies and cigarette advertising. His verse has been influenced more recently by his work as a cognitive therapist.[7]
