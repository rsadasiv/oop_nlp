Born into the gentry in London, Brett attended Hart Hall, Oxford where he entered as a commoner in 1582. He was appointed Rector of Quainton, Buckinghamshire, in 1595.

In 1597 he was admitted bachelor of divinity, and he proceeded in divinity in 1605.

He died in Quainton on 5 April 1637, aged 70, and is buried in the chancel of Quainton Church, which he served for 43 years.
