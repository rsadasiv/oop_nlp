Charles Boyle (born in Leeds in 1951) is a British poet. He has published a novella, 24 for 3, under the pseudonym "Jennie Walker."[1]

Boyle read English at Cambridge, taught in a Sheffield comprehensive and in Egypt[2] and worked in publishing, including several years at Faber and Faber.

In 1980 he married painter Madeleine Strindberg.[3]

He is best known for writing The Age of Cardboard and String.  This book of poems had favourable reviews from The Guardian[4] and Magma Poetry.[5]

In 2007, as a result of his difficulty in getting 24 for 3 published, he established CB editions, a small press dedicated to novellas, translations, and writing in other genres often neglected by mainstream publishers.

Boyle's An Overcoat: Scenes from the Afterlife of H.B., written under the pseudonym "Jack Robinson", was featured in The Guardian's Nicholas Lezard's choice column in April 2017, with Lezard concluding, "I can't think of a wittier, more engaging, stylistically audacious, attentive and generous writer working in the English language right now".[6]
