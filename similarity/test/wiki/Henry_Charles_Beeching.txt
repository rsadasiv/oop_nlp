Henry Charles Beeching (15 May 1859 â€" 25 February 1919)[1]  was an English clergyman, author and poet.[2]

Beeching was born in 1859, he was the son of JPG Beeching of Bexhill in Sussex.[3] He was educated at the City of London School[4] and at Balliol College, Oxford.[5] He took holy orders in 1882, and began work in a Liverpool parish,[6] at Mossley Hill. He was Rector of Yattendon from  1885 to 1900; Clark Lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1900; Professor. of Pastoral Theology at King's College London from 1900 to 1903; Chaplain of Lincoln's Inn from 1900 to 1903;[7]Canon of Westminster from 1902 until 1911[8] and  Dean of Norwich from 1911[9]  until his death. He wrote a book on Francis Atterbury.[10]

To him is attributed the popular epigram on Benjamin Jowett:

This is the first verse of The Masque of B-llâ€"l[11] (1880), a scurrilous undergraduate production in 40 verses satirising Balliol figures. It was suppressed at the time; later research[citation needed] has given Beeching credit for 19 of those.
