Penelope Aubin (c. 1679 â€" 1738?)[1] was an English novelist, poet, and translator.  She published seven novels between 1721-28. Aubin published poetry in 1707 and turned to novels in 1721; she translated French works in the 1720s, spoke publicly on moral issues in 1729, and wrote a play in 1730. Aubin died in April 1738, survived by her husband until his death in April 1740. After the author's death, her works were gathered and published as A Collection of Entertaining Histories and Novels, Designed to Promote the Cause of Virtue and Honor. After the 18th century, Aubin's works fell out of favor with readers because of her writing style and unbelievable plots.

Penelope Aubin's exact origins remain unknown; she was most likely born in London around 1679[2]. While scholars have theorized that she was both Catholic and Huguenot, her biographer, Joel H. Baer, judges asserts that her "family were impoverished Huguenots."[2] She was the daughter of Sir Richard Temple and Anne Charleton. Her mother Anne was the daughter of the physician and natural philosopher Walter Charleton. Aubin married her husband, Abraham Aubin, in 1696, and they had three children: Marie, Abraham, and Penelope. Aubin managed the family business while her husband, a merchant, traveled. She was involved with a scheme by former pirate John Breholt to repatriate the pirates of Madagascar (and their wealth) to England; her 1709 testimony regarding Breholt's character helped discredit Breholt's plans.[3] Aubin was considered a moralistic writer whose writing was unadorned.
