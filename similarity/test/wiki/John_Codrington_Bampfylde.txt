John Codrington Warwick Bampfylde or Bampfield (27 August 1754 â€" 1796/7) was an 18th-century  English poet. He came from a prominent Devon family, his father being Sir Richard Bampfylde, 4th Baronet, and was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.[1] He had financial problems, he had made romantic advances to Mary Palmer, niece of Joshua Reynolds, which she had refused, and he spent the latter part of his life in a psychiatric hospital in London.  [2][3] He died of tuberculosis.

His only published work was Sixteen Sonnets (1778), which attracted the attention of Robert Southey.
