Valerie Anand (born 1937) is a British author of historical fiction.[1]

Under the pen name Fiona Buckley[2][3] she writes the series of historical mysteries, set in the reign of Elizabeth I of England, featuring "Ursula Blanchard" (whose full name is Ursula Faldene Blanchard de la Roche Stannard). Under her own name she writes historical fiction based on the royalty of England and the Bridges over Time series which follows a family from the eleventh century through the twentieth century. She has also written To a Native Shore,  a contemporary novel that explores British prejudice toward Indian Sikhs.

She is also holding the copyrights to The Fallen Pinnacle, a 1997 novel about Atlantis written under the pseudonym Valerie M. Irwin.

Valerie Anand is a believer in the innocence of King Richard III in the matter of the Princes in the Tower, i.e. a Ricardian. She presents this view in Crown of Roses, making the point that the former tutor of Edward V, John Alcock, remained on good terms with the king, which he presumably would not have done had he suspected him of being responsible for the death of his former student.[4]
