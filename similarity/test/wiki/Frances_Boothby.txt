Frances Boothby (floruit 1669â€"1670) was an English playwright, the first woman to have a play produced in London; her tragicomedy Marcelia, or, The Treacherous Friend (published 1670) was performed by the King's Company at the Theatre Royal in 1669. The plot involves romantic difficulties and deceit. It is her only work extant, and little else is known of her.
