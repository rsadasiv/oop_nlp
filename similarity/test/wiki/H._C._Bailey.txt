Henry Christopher Bailey (1878â€"1961) was an English author of detective fiction. Bailey wrote mainly short stories featuring a medically qualified detective called Reggie Fortune.  Fortune's mannerisms and speech put him into the same class as Lord Peter Wimsey but the stories are much darker, and often involve murderous obsession, police corruption, financial skulduggery, child abuse and miscarriages of justice.  Although Mr Fortune is seen at his best in short stories, he also appears in several novels.

A second series character, Joshua Clunk, is a sanctimonious lawyer who exposes corruption and blackmail in local politics, and who manages to profit from the crimes. He appears in eleven novels published between 1930 and 1950, including The Sullen Sky Mystery (1935), widely regarded as Bailey's magnum opus.

Bailey's works were published in a number of magazines, primarily The Windsor Magazine but also Adventure[1] and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.
