John Almon (17 December 1737 â€" 12 December 1805) was an English journalist and writer on political subjects, notable for his efforts to secure the right to publish reports on the debates in Parliament.

He was born in Liverpool and came to London, where in 1761 he was a reporter for the Gazetteer, and published A Review of Mr. Pitt's Administration, which was popular with the opposition. In 1770 he reprinted a letter of "Junius", for which he was put on trial and by a jury found guilty, although it is unclear what, if anything, was his punishment.[1]

During the American Revolution, he published a monthly series of papers entitled The Remembrancer on events in America. In 1784 he established a newspaper, the General Advertiser, but it was unsuccessful. He published Biographical, Literary, and Political Anecdotes in 1797, and his Correspondence with friend John Wilkes appeared posthumously.
