Tim Bowler (born 14 November 1953) is an English author of books for children, teenagers and young adults. He won the 1997 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject, for the novel River Boy.[1]

The Sunday Telegraph has called him "the master of the psychological thriller" [2] and The Independent "one of the truly individual voices in British teenage fiction".[3]

Bowler was born in Leigh-on-Sea, and educated at Westcliff High School for Boys, and at the University of East Anglia where he studied Swedish and Scandinavian studies.

His first published novel was Midget (1994), a psychological thriller set in Leigh-on-Sea. This has been followed by several other novels: Dragon's Rock (1995), a thriller set in Devon; River Boy (1997), a story about love and bereavement and winner of the Carnegie Medal; Shadows (1999), a love story; Storm Catchers (2001), a kidnap thriller; Starseeker (2002), an exploration of love, loss and music, also made into a play; Apocalypse (2004), an allegory about the future of mankind; Frozen Fire (2006), a philosophical thriller about the nature of reality; Bloodchild (2008), a story about memory, secrets and betrayal; Buried Thunder (2011), a dark psychological thriller; and Sea of Whispers (2013), a haunting and mysterious story set on the remote island of Mora.

Blade (2008 to 2013) is a series of urban thrillers. Reviewing it for The Bookbag, Jill Murphy wrote, "Nobody in children's writing is producing anything like this. It's electrifying."[4] Some editions in translation (e.g. Germany and Korea) are four books, each comprising two original volumes.

Bowler speaks at conferences, schools, and book festivals and makes regular appearances on radio. He lives in a village in Devon and writes in a small stone outhouse.[5]
