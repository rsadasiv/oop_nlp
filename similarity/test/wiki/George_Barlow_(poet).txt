George Barlow (19 June 1847, London[1] â€"  1913 or 1914[2]) was an English poet, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym James Hinton.

Barlow was the son of George Barnes Barlow, Master of the Crown Office,[3] and was educated at Harrow School and Exeter College, Oxford.[4] He moved to London in 1871, and continued to live there after his marriage a year later.[2] A prolific poet, his collected Poetical Works amounted to over 3,000 pages of verse. Barlow was dubbed the 'Bard of the sixteen sonnets a day' by his acquaintance Charles Marston, and 'the Poet of spiritualism' by Edward Bennett; his sonnet sequences explored spiritualism and erotic love.[5]

In addition to his published poetry oeuvre, Barlow wrote at least two non-fiction books,  History of the Dreyfus case (1898) and The genius of Dickens.  He was a regular contributor to the Contemporary Review.
