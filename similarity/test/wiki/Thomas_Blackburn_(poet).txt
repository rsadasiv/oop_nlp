Thomas Eliel Fenwick Blackburn (10 February 1916 â€" 13 August 1977) was a British poet. His work is noted for its self-examination and spiritual imagery.[1] His autobiographical novel, A Clip of Steel (1969), portrays a childhood under a repressive clergyman father.[2]

Blackburn was born in Hensingham, Cumberland, England. He was the product of an affair his father had with a Mauritian woman in the West Indies.[3] As a child his father repeatedly washed his face with a mixture of bleach and lemon because he believed it would avoid the appearance of mixed ancestry.[4] After briefly studying law at Selwyn College, Cambridge, he completed a course in psychology at Birkbeck, University of London, before going on to study English at Durham University (Hatfield College).[5] On graduating from Durham in June 1940, he moved down to London and became involved with the Soho literary scene.[6]

He held a Gregory Fellowship in poetry at the University of Leeds between 1956 and 1958.[7] He was married three times, with his second wife Rosalie de Meric, a painter, he had a daughter, Julia Blackburn. Blackburn was an alcoholic and suffered several mental breakdowns during his life.[8] He died from a cerebral haemorrhage at home in Wales as he was getting into bed, immediately after finishing a letter to his brother John.[9]

Blackburn taught at the College of St. Mark and St. John in Chelsea, London, as well as other educational institutions.[10]
