Polly Courtney is an English author and media commentator. She is best known as the author of the novels Golden Handcuffs and Poles Apart.

In her early years, Courtney was a straight-A student who spent her free time playing a multitude of sports and playing violin with various orchestras and string quartets.[2] She grew up in London. Courtney graduated from the University of Cambridge with a first-class degree in mechanical engineering,[3] and worked in investment banking for two years[4] before resigning to spend time writing her first novel based on her experiences in the City.[3] In an interview, she claimed this was due to the strenuous hours and pressures synonymous with the banking culture.[5]

Courtney has written a number of novels. Her early novels, Golden Handcuffs and Poles Apart, were self-published, based on her experiences as an investment banker and the story of a Polish migrant acquaintance.[6] Her publishing success earned her a three-book publishing deal with HarperCollins imprint, Avon.[1] At the release of It's a Man's World in 2011, Courtney announced plans to return to self-publishing because she did not agree with the chick lit marketing approach used by HarperCollins.[7][8] On returning to self-publishing, Courtney said in an interview that she was pleased to have regained control.[9] Feral Youth (2013) is based on Courtney's experiences of the London riots[10] and her concerns that more unrest would be only a matter of time.[11]

Courtney has written commentary pieces on city culture, women in the workplace, Polish migrants, lads' mags, sexism in publishing and youth discontentment for The Observer,[12] The Guardian,[13][14][15][16] The Independent,[17] The Sunday Times,[18] The Evening Standard,[19] Female First,[20] Grazia[21] and Huffington Post.[22]
