Samuel Chandler (1693 â€" 8 May 1766) was a British Nonconformist minister, dissenter and polemicist pamphleteer. He energetically engaged with the religious disputes and published many sermons, pamphlets and letters. He translated and expanded the Historia Inquisitionis, of Philipp van Limborch, from Latin into English.

Samuel Chandler was born at Hungerford in Berkshire, where his father was a minister. He went to school in Gloucester with his lifelong friends Bishop Butler and Archbishop Secker, and continued his studies at Leiden. In recognition of his talents and aptitude for learning he was elected fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and was made DD of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He  refused offers of high preferment in the Church of England choosing instead to remain a Presbyterian minister to the end of his life. His outlook could be described as moderately Calvinist with Arianist leanings.

Chandler played a leading role in the heated deist controversies of his time, and discussed the possibility of an 'Act of Comprehension' with bishops. From 1716 to 1726 he preached at Peckham, and was pastor of the Old Jewry meeting-house for forty years.  When he became a victim of the South Sea Bubble financial crash of 1720  and found himself in debt, he ran a book-shop[1] called "The Bible and Crown" in the Poultry, in London for a few years.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December, 1754.[2]
Samuel Chandler was buried in Bunhill Fields cemetery.
