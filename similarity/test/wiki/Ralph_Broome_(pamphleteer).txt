Ralph Broome (1742‚Ä"1805) was an English stockjobber, pamphleteer and satirical poet. Several of his works argued in defence of Warren Hastings during the latter's impeachment proceedings.

The third son of Ralph Broome (1714‚Ä"1768) of the manor of Bushton, Wiltshire,[1] Broome was sent as a cadet to India, where he acquired Oriental languages, including Persian, and became a judge advocate with the rank of captain in the Bengal Army.

While in India, Broome fathered a daughter, Miriam (c. 1781‚Ä"1840), by an unknown Indian lady. The girl accompanied him back to England in about 1785. An Amelia Margaret Broome, mentioned in Ralph Broome's will, may be an illegitimate daughter of Miriam, or possibly of her father. In 1803, Miriam was married to Broome's lawyer nephew, also Ralph Broome (1781‚Ä"1838).

In 1790, Broome himself married Lucy Jeffreys, a daughter of Richard Jeffreys of Penkelly, Brecknockshire, Wales, but she died at Bristol Hot Wells in 1796. He then married the widowed Charlotte Ann Francis, n√©e Burney (1761‚Ä"1838), on 28 February 1798. Their only child was a son, Ralph, known as "Dolph" (1801‚Ä"1817).

The marriage caused consternation in Charlotte's father Charles Burney, her sister Frances Burney and other members of the family, mainly because of doubts about Broome's finances, although they became reconciled to it later.[2] The Broomes moved to Bath, Somerset in about 1803,[3] where Broome rapidly deteriorated mentally and physically and died "a howling death" on 24 February 1805, attended to the last by his wife and one or more of his daughters.[4]

Broome was a prolific pamphleteer and versifier. Although he had not known Warren Hastings personally in India, he attended the impeachment proceedings and argued in Hastings' defence in several works. Broome's published works include:
