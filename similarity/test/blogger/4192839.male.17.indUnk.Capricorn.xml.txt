A Vote  for life?     By Crystal Broyles August, 12, 2004        Last week during a passing conversation with a woman, I realized that she held the life of a U.S. soldier higher than she did the life of an unborn American child. This realization came to me when she told me who she was going to cast her presidential ballot for this year and why. She said that she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t trust Bush and was going to vote for John Kerry. Her reason was that she had already seen what Bush could do and she was sick of young American men and woman being killed in the Middle East. She feels as though her vote for John Kerry opposed to George Bush is a vote in favor of saving life.           When I heard her reasoning a pang struck deep into me. This dear woman along with a lot of other Americans value the life of a U.S. soldier more than they do the life of an unborn American child.           Yesterday as I spoke on the phone, the conversation that I just told you about came up. The person on the phone said, ‚ÄoeAnd what people don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t realize and forget is that the guys that are over there right now in Iraq, half of their generation didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make it ‚Ä" they were aborted‚Ä¶‚Äù           John Kerry has asked the American people ‚Äoeto judge me by my record‚Ä¶‚Äù So now let us take him up on his word and judge him by his record.           Thanks to modern day technology judging a candidate by his/her record is easier than ever. Just go online to Project Vote Smart (www.vote-smart.org), type in the last name of the candidate you are researching and voila, everything you want to know! Or you can just go to this URL: http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=S0421103 that will take you directly to John Kerry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s record. I urge you to click on ‚ÄoeVoting Record‚Äù ‚Ä" then you will be able to effectively judge him by his record.            When I explored his abortion voting record I discovered, from his record, that by voting for John Kerry I would not be voting to save life. He has consistently voted in favor of the legal destruction of unborn humans.            President Bush, on the other hand, has consistently fought for the rights of the unborn. On April 23, 2004 the Family Research Council‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s website reported, ‚ÄoePresident Bush has never wavered on the abortion issue. From reinstating the Mexico City policy (which bans U.S. funding of foreign abortions), to allowing states to provide government-subsidized health care to fetuses, to signing the Partial Birth Abortion ban and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act into law, the President has consistently fought for the rights of the unborn.‚Äù           In John Kerry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s democratic presidential nomination acceptance speech he talked about freedom, restoring democracy, and the choices involved in elections. ‚ÄoeThey should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism ‚Ä¶ My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.‚Äù           In other words John Kerry thinks he is just the man to bring our country back to what it was founded to be. There's only one problem. Our founding father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s valued human life. What is human life?           Sadly today human life is something to be treated as entirely expendable and entirely a matter of convenience. However it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t always this way. There was a time, not long ago, when human life was valued. When the founding threads of our nation were being drafted ‚Ä" human life and preservation were precious principles. In 1776 when Thomas Jefferson penned our sacred Declaration of Independence, he wrote ‚Äoeall men are created equal‚Äù and ‚Äoeendowed ‚Ä¶ with certain unalienable rights‚Äù and among these rights ‚Äoelife‚Äù was the first listed. Why was life the first listed? Because life is essential for us to enjoy and exercise any of the other rights we are most humbly granted as American citizens. Thomas Jefferson also wrote ‚ÄoeThe care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government.‚Äù As you can see ‚Ä" our nation was rooted deeply in the belief of human life being something valuable and worth protecting.                 Nothing happens over night ‚Ä" all of this is the result of a domino effect. I wonder, how will my children view human life? We can make a difference now; we can change how our generation views human life, therefore preserving the sanctity and value of God‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gift of life ‚Ä" for our future generations. How can we do that? What actions can we take? As voting American citizens ‚Ä" we have a voice. When we consider a candidate and go to the polls ‚Ä" we need to evaluate more than just whether or not this candidate will boost our economy. We need to know what value the candidate places on human life  Did You Know?      Abortion deaths each year outnumber American casualties in all our wars combined.More than a million abortions every year is a staggeringly high figure, especially when one considers that the number of unborn babies who die every year from abortion is higher than all American casualties from the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I & II, the Korean War, Vietnam, Persian Gulf Wars, and Operation Iraqi Freedom  combined .  Abortions 1.5 million/year Operation Iraqi Freedom - Less than 1,000 Gulf War - Less than 200 Vietnam War - 58,151 Korean War - 54,246 WW II - 407,316 WW I - 116,708 Civil War - 498,332 Revolutionary Wars - 25,324 Total War Deaths: 1,044,569       I am not saying that a U.S. Soldier is more or less valuable than an unborn child. What I am saying is, if you value human life, then let us value all of life - born and unborn. I think Dr. Seuss summed it up quite well in his book Horton Hears a Who, when he said:  ‚Äoe Because, after all, a person's a person, no matter how small. ‚Äù                                                                                         ## Please feel free to send this to all your friends.

Kerry is an interesting contrast...  who is the real John Kerry?    I know many people who just believe Bush is incompetent and Kerry is the best qualified source, and many of these people are highly qualified individuals.               John Kerry has served in combat, prosecuted as a lawyer, served as a Lietenant Governor, and a Senator...      The man's no slouch...

What Would Kerry Do?   He talks a good game, but Kerry won't find it easy to convince voters he'd be a better commander in the war on terror  By Richard Wolffe and Susannah Meadows Newsweek  Aug. 16 issue - While the president gets briefed in his high-tech Sit Room deep in the West Wing's basement, John Kerry's intel sessions are a much more makeshift affair. Seven hours after the White House offered to brief him, Kerry, who'd been unwilling to bump any campaign events, was finally parked in one place long enough so that a secure phone line could be set up in his bus. After playing softball with firefighters and autoworkers in Taylor, Mich., Kerry boarded his bus next to the field, and, still wearing his TEAM KERRY jersey, heard what lay behind last week's terror warnings. While his aides described the call as simply "informative," the glimpse into the top-secret intel made its political mark all the same. Kerry tiptoed warily around the warning, and kept his distance from Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who accused the Bush administration of manipulating the warning to help boost the president's re-election bid. Kerry wasn't always so respectful. Standing beside Dean six months ago, he reacted with scorn to a previous Orange alert. "The president is actually playing for the culture of fear in our country," he said in a televised debate in Iowa.  Whatever his change of tone, Kerry's campaign remains deeply critical of the president's war on terror. His aides say the president has failed to secure the homeland by spending too little on firefighters, port security, or protecting nuclear and chemical plants. Kerry's advisers blame the shortfall in part on the fact that the areas facing the biggest threat‚Ä"the corridors connecting Boston to Washington, Chicago to Detroit, and Seattle to San Diego‚Ä"vote Democratic. "If they really looked at where the threats were, they'd be spending money in areas that are not their base," says Rand Beers, Kerry's national-security adviser, who previously served in the Bush White House as its counterterrorism director.  What would Kerry do differently in the fight against Al Qaeda? He wants to double the number of Special Forces and spies. He also wants to deploy a bigger international force to secure Afghanistan, not least in Al Qaeda and Taliban territory on the border with Pakistan. He also might scrap the color-coded alert system‚Ä"aides say it's become ineffective‚Ä"for a new one that incorporates more specific information about what precautions people should take. Beyond military force, Kerry wants to win the war of ideas in the Arab and Islamic world, with stronger trade and improved educational programs.  While the president talks about stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction, Kerry wants to spend more money, and sign new international agreements, to secure loose nukes. While the president talks about closing down terrorist finances, Kerry wants to name and shame uncooperative banks and countries‚Ä"and even shut them out of U.S. markets. And where Bush would create an intelligence director outside the White House and the cabinet, Kerry says he would give the new czar full power to control funding and personnel across the intel community. He may talk tough, but Kerry still faces his biggest challenge convincing voters he'd be a better commander in the war on terror than Bush. Polls show the president holding a double-digit lead over Kerry on terrorism and homeland security. And the Bush campaign is relentlessly attacking Kerry's Senate record, accusing him of missing intel committee meetings and proposing to cut intel spending a decade ago. For Kerry, that leaves little room for maneuvering. While his aides dodged the media's questions about the move to Code Orange, Kerry criticized Bush for lingering in a Florida classroom on the morning of 9/11. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani shot back by accusing Kerry of being "indecisive" and taking his cues from filmmaker Michael Moore. With or without a secure phone line, Kerry knows he'll need a better connection if he's going to beat the man who runs the Sit Room on the terror front.  ¬© 2004 Newsweek, Inc.

Socialism is on   the way?  By Crystal Broyles, August, 4, 2004  How do you see America ‚Ä" is it the land of opportunity or a land of equality for all? For countless individuals since before Thomas Jefferson drafted our sacred Declaration of Independence, people wanting a better life have immigrated to this land that is now the United States of America. Why? Because the opportunities in America are not the same for everyone however we all have equal access to opportunity. For instances ‚Ä" a immigrant from Poland isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to come to America and set up a restaurant making Mexican food. What?! The Polish making Mexican food?! Stop. I want you to think about that. Why is it that Polish immigrants don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come to America to own Mexican food restaurants and Hispanic people do not come to America to sell Polish foods? Once again, because the opportunities in America are not the same for everyone however we all have equal access to opportunity. For the same reason Polish immigrants do not own Mexican food restaurants; we do not all have the same health care providers, we have different living standards, personal values and cultures. We are America ‚Ä" the Land of Opportunity.  Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take a look at what John Kerry and John Edwards see when they see an America where in which they are President and Vice President. The other night as I sat listening to Vice Presidential Democratic candidate John Edwards, I said to myself, ‚ÄoeJohn Edwards is a great speaker and he sure sounds nice ‚Ä¶ but how could his and Kerry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeplan‚Äù be enacted without destroying the United States?‚Äù What does the Kerry/Edwards ‚Äoeplan‚Äù consists of? Let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s take a look at some highlights of their ‚Äoeplan‚Äù.  Their ‚Äoeplan‚Äù will do away with:  1. The ‚Äoetwo health care systems‚Äù that we are currently subjected to. 2. The ‚Äoetwo school systems‚Äù. 3. ‚ÄoeTwo economies‚Äù.  Now obviously there are more than two health care systems and two school systems ect. in the United States, I am just quoting John Edwards. However the Kerry/Edwards agenda is clear; they want to take away the gap between the rich and the poor. This will be done by making all American‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s equal. We will have equal jobs, educations, health care, ‚Ä¶  There is a startling comparison to be found if we look back into history at the former Soviet Union. The suppressed socialistic nation of the U.S.S.R. was brought about by making all its citizens ‚Ä" equal. The Kerry/Edwards team has a vision for America and that vision is equality to all and for all. Their politics are the same politics that left detrimental results to people of the Soviet Union.  Michael Ferris, President of Patrick Henry College was lecturing last week about leaders. In this lecture he spoke about how those who are great leaders understand and know the past through studying history. The reason why it is so important for leaders to know history is to prevent the same failures that others before you have committed.  Last week during the Democratic National Convention there were many speeches made and quite a few stories told within these speeches. When John Kerry formally accepted his nomination as the Democratic Presidential Nominee, he gave a speech and told some stories. One of the stories was about how as a child living overseas he rode his bike into Berlin, an area he was not permitted to ride his bicycle into and as a result his father punished him for his actions. Mind you at this time in history the Berlin wall still stood and the Russians were still suffering greatly. John Kerry has seen the results of ‚Äoeequality for all‚Äù with his very own eyes. Mr. Kerry has not learned from history ‚Ä" how can he lead our nation?  The Kerry/Edwards team has a ‚Äoeplan‚Äù and all John Edwards wants us to know is, in his own words ‚Äoehope is on the way ‚Ä¶ for our one America‚Äù Now let me ask you, is this the America that you see and want?

Why  Not?!

Iraq returns to Olympic action with soccer upset  PATRAS, Greece (AP) ‚Ä" In its first Olympic competition since its country was shattered by war, Iraq upset Portugal 4-2 on Thursday in a gritty, come-from-behind victory as about 200 chanting fans cheered and jumped wildly. Iraq's Mahmoud Younis, front, scored the go-ahead goal. By Dimitriou Dimitris, AFP Portugal went ahead at the 12th minute when Iraqi defender Habar Haidar accidentally kicked the ball into his own net as he tried to clear a pass by Cristiano Ronaldo. Three minutes later, however, Mohammed Emad tied it after picking up a rebound from the goalkeeper, Moreira. Iraq went ahead 2-1 in the 28th minute when Mohammed Hawar scored on a soft shot after dribbling past the goalkeeper, but Portugal tied it with a minute to go in the first half on a goal by Bosingwa. Mahmoud Younis put Iraq ahead 3-2 in the 50th minute, and Sadit Salih scored during injury time to seal the victory. The Iraq fans, mostly students who traveled to Pampeloponnisiako Stadium from various Greek cities, chanted and jumped in unison. Some waved Iraqi flags and signs in Arabic as unarmed police watched. At the end of the match, the jubilant Iraqi players ran across the field holding their raised hands above their heads. Portugal ended the match with 10 men after Boa Morte was ejected for rough play. As the Portuguese player left the field, he was showered with dozens of plastic bottles by Iraqi fans. Iraq was a surprise addition to the Olympic tournament. The nation managed to cobble together a team amid ongoing conflict at home and efforts to rebuild an Olympic committee that was previously run by Saddam Hussein's late son, Uday, who allegedly ordered the torture of players who fell out of favor. In May, Iraq clinched an Olympic soccer berth just three months after being reinstated by the International Olympic Committee. Two months later, the team's German coach, Bernd Stange, resigned, claiming authorities advised him to leave for his safety. He was replaced by his assistant, Adnan Hamad, who coached Iraq's national soccer team to victory in the West Asian Championship in 2002 and played on the national team during the early 1980s. In July, Iraq reached the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup that included a 2-1 win over regional soccer power Saudi Arabia. Iraq leads the Group D with three points, while Costa Rica and Morocco have one after playing to a scoreless tie Thursday.    What an incredible tribute to the new free Iraq... A restructuring of the broken Iraqi soul....      I love it....         Iraq is now my second favorite to win.....

 Capital Games : "'That's why you've got to be careful about this rhetoric, we're only going to tax the rich. You know who the--the rich in America happen to be the small business owners. That's what that means. Just remember, when you're talking about, oh, we're just going to run up the taxes on a certain number of people -- first of all, real rich people figure out how to dodge taxes. [Laughter.] And the small business owners end up paying a lot of the burden of this taxation.' "   Bush made this comment in one of his "town hall" meetings. Many may say he was just joking, but why should he be joking about such a serious matter as this? He doesnt seem to grasp the gravity of the charges made against him, and if he does, he is not implementing that in his thoughts and words.      Joking about tax-dodging?      No laughing matter

 MediaGuardian.co.uk Media Al-Jazeera closure 'a blow to freedom' : "Al-Jazeera closure 'a blow to freedom'  Lisa O'Carroll and agencies Monday August 9, 2004   Al-Jazeera: the authorities have closed the station for 30 days  The Iraq prime minister's decision to throw al-Jazeera out of Baghdad and ban it from operating for 30 days is 'a serious blow to press freedom', Reporters Sans FrontiÔøΩres has said. The Paris-based media watchdog demanded 'an immediate explanation' for the move on Saturday, saying it was 'extremely concerned about persistent episodes of censorship in Iraq'. Police ordered al-Jazeera's employees out of their newsroom and locked the door on Saturday night after the prime minister accused the pan-Arab satellite channel of inciting violence. 'They have been showing a lot of crimes and criminals on TV, and they [send] a bad picture about Iraq and about Iraqis and encourage criminals to increase their activities,' Iraq's interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, said. Al-Naqib said the closure was intended to give the station 'a chance to readjust their policy against Iraq'. Prime minister Ayad Allawi cited the hoax videotape broadcast by the channel on Saturday that appeared to show an American being beheaded as an example of the coverage he opposed. 'I am worried about these people,' he said. 'I am not worried about whether al-Jazeera will like it or not.' A spokesman for the channel today said it showed just eleven seconds of the hoaxter's tape and went to great lengths afterwards to discuss how it had been duped by the American who had put the footage on the internet. Mr Allawi brushed off criticism of the move, saying that the network's coverage of kidnappings encouraged terrorists.     I think that this is a dangerous precedent to begin, yes, they have a different view. But isnt that what news stations are about? Different news stations provide different views.

Close minds accomplish nothing, except more stereotypes, and ignorance. If you have the truth, why should you be afraid of debate? The truth is the supreme issue in the world, and it will emerge in the end.   Truth is the issue, and in the free market of ideas, it will be most profitable
