No, this posting is not about the ill-fated Paula Abdul hit, whose video featured a gaudy, tap-dancing cartoon cat.  Although, when you think about it-- that cat really thought he was cooler than Paula in the video.  What nerve!  No one was cooler than Paula back then.  She was a Laker Girl, for Pete's sake.  But I digress.  This posting is about my feet.  I have the feet of a 95 year old woman (I'll spare you the gruesome details about the evidence that causes me to feel this way).  If given the opportunity to have reconstructive surgery of ANY kind, I would have a foot-lift (rhinoplasty coming in a close second- I'll save that little vignette of vanity for another time).  Little nip here, tuck there, maybe some dermabrasion treatments...  The resurgence of flip-flops (tragically known as "thongs" in many areas of the USA) make it very difficult to live with ugly feet.  Cute feet are everywhere, it seems.  Cute, obedient feet are rewarded with slip-ons and strappy sandals, and yet I wander the earth in sneakers and low-cut socks.  No pedicure can save them, believe me, I have tried everything.  Technicians at several reputable, high-end Chicago salons have BLANCHED at the mere sight of them.    Was it years of uncomfortable dance shoes that made my feet this way? Perhaps it was the pair of now-weathered Doc Marten boots that I wore all throughout high school?  Maybe the real culprits were the many pairs of clunky, UDA-endorsed Nikes, that never seemed to fit quite right.  What have I done to deserve this fate?!

Last night over cheeseburgers and beer, my mother (but you can call her J-Dawg) asked me, "So what is this blog thing?" and I didn't really have an articulate answer for that.  It's partly a way to waste my time, I'm sure, but mostly just an outlet and something that is hopefully relatively entertaining for others.  In an effort to keep all of you beautiful people amused for today, see the following list of some of my favorite time-wasting websites.  Where did I find these, you ask?  That's the beauty of the internet-- I don't remember.    - www.extremepumpkin.com - www.bluejake.com - www.chicagoist.com - www.mrpicassohead.com - www.flowgo.com (this one is esp. hilarious- be sure to check out "Baby  Queen" and "Arnold & Gary Spice Boys Rap")  Enjoy!  It's almost Friday....

inability  \In`a*bil"i*ty\, n. [Pref. in- not + ability: cf. F. inhabilet['e]. See Able, and cf. Unable.] The quality or state of being unable; lack of ability; want of sufficient power, strength, resources, or capacity.  By the way, I'm a novice at HTML Coding.  Once I get rolling, you can expect this humble little blog to have quite a bit more artistic value.  No offense, of course, to the talent behind the master template (www.stopdesign.com).

You'll notice to the left of this page, that there is a hyperlink that results in my "profile" on the blogspot website.  Frankly, those are my standard answers for all questionnaires like that...and it's becoming a little predictable.  Besides, I've been told that I need to redeem myself after naming "The Cutting Edge" as one of my favorite movies (and it is).  Some of my lesser-known favorite things: - small dogs that don't shed  - organizing my sock drawer - impulsive haircuts - InstaBronze self-tanning machines - pineapple smoothies (no dairy mix-ins, fruit only) - good manners - playing air guitar to really bad 80s rock music - friends that love me despite my tendency to put my foot in my mouth - historical memoirs - anyone who laughs at my lame humor - coaching - anything by Ella Moss  In other news, I'm currently taking suggestions for daily update topics.  Got anything you need to get off your chest?  Want to spurn hatred for something or someone?  Let me know- I'm in need of content for site.  I've decided that having this blog will be an exercise in observation for me, since most things fly RIGHT over my head.  Wish me luck.

After several months of stalking other people's blogs, I figured that I should just start my own.  So here it is!  Given the amount of time that I spend on the internet (hey- a lot of it really is for work purposes) and the speed at which I surf, this thing should get updated about every 15 minutes.   ;)  For those of you looking for an erudite perspective on the modern world, or perhaps a cynical ranting here and there...well, you may get the latter.  For those of you interested in the minutiae of my daily life, then you've found your dream blog.  I make no guarantee that what you find here will actually qualify as productive, progressive information.  Feel free to respond at your discretion- I welcome any and all constructive criticism.  Particularly from those of you that have some idea of what a proper blog should look like.  Welcome!

I'm pretty busy today, so this will have to make this quick.  I love to shop.  Enjoy some of my favorite online shops!      Kitson     Red Envelope     Neighborhoodies     Amazon     Redhead Boutique     BlueFly     Go Clothing     Shopbop     Net a Porter     Stationery Studio     Plum Party     Uncommon Goods     The GAP     Sephora

With the possible exception of my year-long sojourn in central and western Tennessee, I have followed roughly the same path as other people in my demographic.  I graduated from a competitive, suburban, mega-high school, went to the big, in-state, beer-soaked University, and then moved to the north side of Chicago.  Nothing about me screams individuality.  So it would seem normal that I'm constantly running into people that I know.  I see someone from high school or college EVERYWHERE I go.  But it doesn't feel normal at all.  Is it wrong that I prefer NOT to see some of these people again?  Is it a bad thing to have hoped that some of my not-so-favorite people from high school and college have just married into a family from one of the coasts, and moved there?  I'll take the northern midwest, and they have everything west of the Mississippi, east of Indianapolis, and south of Tupelo.  How's that sound?  The reason I say this is because I constantly feeling like I'm falling prey to the social dance I like to call, "The Meaningless Acknowledgement of Their Presence."  I'm sure this goes both ways, so my apologies to anyone who has had to do this, after running into ME.  Have you ever seen someone from your past, and out of a reflex of Post-esque etiquette, said hello?  Maybe you asked how they are, but really didn't care and didn't really listen to their response?  What is it that is hard-wired into each of us, that forces us to have this conversation over and over?  Why can't we just pretend we didn't see the other person, and move on with our lives?    We all know that class reunions are dreadful affairs.  Tacky balloons, deep-fried appetizers, and self-adhesive nametags.  Shouldn't we save all of our innane, "how have you been?" conversations for those events?  Do I really have to go through the motions every time I see someone on Michigan Ave, on the eL, or at the Southport Einsteins (when I am wearing my pajamas, with no make up on, and this person once asked me to the homecoming dance in a note, passed to me by his best friend in AP US History)?

I don't understand gaudy jewelry.  I saw a woman on the eL this morning, sporting the most hideous piece of jewelry that I have ever seen.  I'm not an expert, but I know the difference between fashionably chunky, loose-stoned jewelry, and a hunk of turquoise bigger than a 16" softball hanging on a silver chain that would make Mr. T jealous.  I do not claim to be a fashionista, hell, I don't even know when fashion week is.  I know it's in New York, which is a loud, dirty city whose inhabitants, for the most part, do not meet the Midwestern standard of politeness to which I am accustomed.  A few great museums, a big park, and Donald Trump do not a cultural mecca make.  But I digress.  Back to jewelry.     Isn't the point of having an accessory, such as jewelry, to enhance an outfit and not distract the observant?  Why would anyone put something the size of a hubcap around their neck and expect it to quietly compliment their outfit?  Even the great Stevie Nicks, despite her misguided love of lace, scarves, and guinevere sleeves, knew when to call it quits with the jewelry.    For that matter, what's up with the gi-normous rings that I have been seeing people wear these days?  It's one thing to represent with a huge, iced-out cocktail ring,  If that's one of the few pieces of jewelry you are wearing.   But it's entirely another matter to put two rings on one finger, simply to leave another finger free for more jewelry.     When do we draw the line?  When is enough, enough?

So I haven't posted in a week, much to your dismay, I'm sure.    I have been sitting here for the better part of 25 minutes, starting up a rant, then deleting it.  There have been 4 almost-posts.  I can't seem to focus on anything- my work, my desk, not even my email.  If there's one thing I can always lose myself in, it's email-- but not today.    I feel as if I'm a victim of Adult-Onset ADHD, with a mind full of gobbletygook, and an itchin' to get the hell out.  Out of where? Who knows?  Just out.

So it appears that two of my favorite websites are very much in competition with one another- I had no idea!    Chicagoist   and    GeekTastic   are apparently warring one another for the top Chicago-themed blog. Personally, I also like    Gapers Block  , but I probably shouldn't pick one over the other. They might blackball me from the "cool blog" lists. Oh wait, I was never on those lists to begin with. Hmmm.   Work has been a little bit crazy these days, because our big event is nearing. So my posts have (don't cry now) been few and far between. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up the pace soon, but until I do, enjoy these links- they're great time wasters!

Well, I have to brag.  I have to.  My niece, thanks to my totally pompous self-promotion, is now famous.  Check her out as "Neighborhoodie of the Day" at   http://neighborhoodies.com/design/notd/notd_15.htm .   How adorable can one baby be?  At 13 m.o., I think we should definitely consider getting this lass a talent agent.  That is, assuming that she grows up as cute and talented as she currently is-- you know, with the ability to learn and master two syllable words.    Be sure to vote for her in the "Neighborhoodie of the Week" election!  Bri for NOTW!

There are ghosts from my past living in my neighborhood.  One of which is Mark Harris, one of the funniest people that I've ever met, but never remember to call when I'm out and about.  Totally my fault.  The other is Lucas Johnson, one of the star basketball players from my graduating class at the   University of Illinois .    Every so often, I see Lucas puttering around the 'hood, usually dressed in a pair of incredibly wrinkly dockers, a 3-button henley, and a ratty pair of sneakers.  I just laugh to myself, thinking about how half my dance team teammates were in LOVE with him.  This morning, on the eL, I saw him again.  He was eating orange gatorade and m&m's for breakfast.  Blecch.  Just thinking about that makes me want to run home and brush my teeth.  So, with inspiration from my roommate KateK, this sighting begs the question-- what do YOU eat for breakfast?  Post away.

Why is it that we are made to feel that relaxing is such a crime these days?  Is it the bad economy, with it's seemingly constant layoff cycle?  Is it my mother, who is never seen sitting still (and has potentially passed this much-feared gene to me)?  When we put "experienced at multitasking" on a resume, do we then feel obligated to actually do so?  Why is this- what is true value of multitasking...why bother?   In moderation, I believe that sloth is a fantastic thing.  Is it such a crime to want to sit down in front of the television, without feeling like you need to be doing something else simultaneously?  When did television become the nefarious, evil-doing enemy of the so-called productive masses?  This is not to discount the development of things like TiVo, which actually streamlines sloth.  I am in favor of inventions such as this.   What I am not in favor of, however, is the constant guilt that we feel to do 14 things, at one time.  (For the record, I am not referring to any guilt that may result from my mother's hyperactivity which, in the great irony of life, has actually become one of her more endearing traits.)  It becomes clear why society is more stressed out than ever these days, and why children feel like being involved in tee-ball, ballet, soccer, and language classes isn't much.  Has anyone else noticed that kids don't play outside very much anymore?  What happened to "ghosts in the graveyard," and spinning around until you fell down in the grass?  Parents and non-parents alike-- take back your weekends!  Remind the office why they call it the "business week."  Everybody get out there, and watch some syndicated Brady Bunch re-runs! 

Anyone who has seen me dancing at a bar needs to see this video.  Turn up the volume, and rock out.  It's office friendly, by the way, if no one in your company would be offended by a hip-hop hippo.    Have fun!

It's weekends like this past one that remind me why I love Chicago.  Other than this afternoon's stifling humidity, the weather was absolutely beautiful.  I was able to visit with my family as well, for one of my FAVORITE nights of the entire year-- Venetian Night.  If you're unfamiliar with Venetian Night, I will sum it up for you: the best fireworks of the year.  This year, my parents officially became hip cats, and moved into a very nice apartment on the lake.  So I was able to watch the parade of boats and fireworks, complete with 2 of the best inventions in the world, air conditioning and Diet Coke.  I was also able to spend time with my niece   Brianna  and some family friends.  I spent the rest of my weekend doing absolutely nothing.  (with the exception of the impromptu Cocker Spaniel doggy-wash earlier today- thanks to Jen and Mos Jef for bringing Seamus by the apartment)  It was fantastic.  Hope you all had an equally relaxing and enjoyable weekend.

I do, however, know when I'll be back again.  :)  I am signing off for a few days, and heading off to New York for work.  I'd attempt to post while onsite, but I can pretty much guarantee that it would result in pointless, rambling stupidity.  You know, like all my other posts.    Hope you have a great week and a half- I'll be back in the glorious summertime Chi on the 21st.  If any of you happen to be in Manhattan before then, get in touch-- I'll be in need of a friendly face.

i know i'm going to get bashed for this, but i just don't like new york.  it smells funny here.  i feel as if, when walking down the street, that one of the buildings is going to lift up a concrete foot, slam it down on me, and crush me like an ant.  ooh, i miss home so much!  i'm exhausted, so much in fact, that i'm not even bothering to use capital letters in this post.  i'll just lie and say that i'm channelling e.e. cummings.  new york is fantastic (meaning: unbelievable, not wonderful), loud and dirty.  i don't enjoy having to dodge roaches in the street, or avoid tourists that are standing, huddled in the middle of the sidewalk, eyes to the skies and mouths agape.  i did, however, find salvation in little italy- angelo's on mulberry street is sooooo good.  mmmm...mezzalune ravioli with tomato cream sauce, a robust pinot noir, and my boyfriend there to make me laugh.  it was almost enough to make me forget that i'm here to work!  :)  then again, my span of attention has been notoriously short these days.  speaking of which, i really have to go.  talk to you all soon!
