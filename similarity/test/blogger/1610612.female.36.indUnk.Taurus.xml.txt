Enough with the sap already. I know that anyone besides my best friend reading that would fall asleep. hahahah Oh well, fuck off its still how I feel. Oh Lord, what is wrong with everyone?  I have a rule that I do not trust anyone who reveals too much of their personal lives in  a short time. Example: i am working with someone, and have known them a week. I now know; her husband cheated on her and left her, she relinquished custody of her daughter when she was 1 year old, she does not have her son with her, she tends to drink too much and smokes weed. I also seems she is a little boy crazy and in search of some sort of emotional/sexual validation. Oh, did I mention she actually works for me? I am her fucking boss! Stop, I dont care. Now, I am a very caring person, but get a magazine rack over here, this girl has issues spilling out of her ass.    She needs emotional depends.   Fuck I am tired of people thinking they can tell me all their shit. If I wanted to hear all this, I wouldve become a therapist. But, alas, I am not.   Not like I am so together, or have not had my share of stuff, but my goddess this is too much. I am past all the drama. I dont want it any more, I want my quiet little life. Everyone assumes I want to hang out with them. I am a little too old, and have so many other interests, none of which include looking at the faces of the people I am forced to spend  40 hrs a week with.  Advice to people who want to "share" with anyone they meet :  They dont really care, they are being nice to you to get you to go away. Save up your money and get a shrink, and tell them your shit.   Wow how deliciously bitchy. Ok , I just wanted to say deliciously. I had the most curious dream this morning when I took a nap. I dreamed my husband was cheating on me with other men. He is fiercly hetero, so it was weird. Even weirder was all I could think in the dream was " Oh well, I cant compete with that". In the dream I was actually resigned to the fact that I could never give a man the same pleasure as someone who "owned the equipment". hahahahhaha

Now here is my secret, very simply secret: you can only see things clearly with your heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye  .     aaah, the Little Prince.  I was with my baby at our neighborhoods "toddler time", when all the little ones play together. We were right outside the gym. I thought how sad it was that instead of running outside and playing like little children, they were miserable and running on the indoor tracks.  I have had alot of little epiphanies like that since I had my son. I know it sounds trite, but I have learned more from this new little soul than I have in the 33 years before I had him. I had no idea what love was really all about, what patience was about. How little moments make all the difference in the world.  I see everything differently now. I am so much more calm than I was. Ok, I still worry about stupid stuff, but not like I used to. I dont care if I am the skinniest, or the coolest, or even if my pants dont have cookie sludge on them. Why? Because he loves me because I am his Mommy, not because of the external. I mostly love my body now, because how could I hate something that brought that wonderful being into the world? My cesarean scar is beautiful to me, a badge of honor.

I have so much running around in my head. Like little cockroaches scurrying from the light. How the hell can I catch them? Okay, I have to say I find it hard to beleive that there was even a question of whether or not to revoke the liscense of the driver who killed  people in Santa Monica. They had to think about it? And excuse me, but many people have said to me "well, it was just an accident". No, a fender bender is an accident. To keep driving after you mow down actual human beings is stupidity. Ok, soo he panicked. But he kept on going! Its appalling that we even consider that with his age he just didnt know. Then he shouldnt have been driving period. agggggh There are so  many stupid and horrible things that go on, I wonder why I bother to write about any of them. I would be here all the time. I have to say, I have become as much of a Pollyanna as I can be. I cant watch news anymore. It upsets me. Like the strange and awful glee that has been around lately at the killing of Husseins sons.  They report it joyfully. Jay Leno makes jokes about it. Oh, haha, two people are dead. Okay, not the best representation of the species, but my god, try not to act so damn happy about it. Have a little reverence. Jeez.          Which Unwanted    Sexual Gesture Are You?

So, today, I find out that I have to be "relocated". How odd that I was whining about my apartment, and now I have to go to a new one. They have to tear down a wall because oof mold, so they are paying to move us to another apartment in the complex. Jeez. Oh well, at least my house will be clean . hahahahahhahaha

As I sit here typing, my interactive Yoda refuses to shut up. He is determined to continue my Jedi training. Silly Yoda!  So many things to say, all of them about Tanya.hahahah I am the devil, I think. Or a minion. mmmm  O crap, anyhow, I am in a funk. I  want to move away from here. Pack up my  little familly and go, but I have to wait, and I am not good at that. As Veruca says "I want it NOW".  But, I will try to be adult, because chronologically I am. I was talking to a friend of mine how we were lied to about adult hood. I always thought you reached some magical point where you were ADULT. All of the sudden, you wouldnt think the way you did before. What a jip.  I still feel like a little kid. Jeez. But lately, I have so many damn reminders of my age. Oh well. Okay thats it for today.  Just in case anyone was checking ;)

mmmmmmmm... strong> I had to drive an evil, long drive today, and I was just thinking and thinking. Sometimes a dangerous prospect, if you knew me. I thought about how I am a 35 yr old woman, I have grey hair and stretch marks,but I am beautiful. I am a wonderful, unique person. I try to teach my baby this, so I better start praticing what I preach. Lately, I have to remind my self alot, only because I am trying to overcome my own mind. I still think like a teenage girl sometimes. I shrink in the face of authority, instead of being confident. I have to stop that, and so I will. I am making headway, but breaking a 35 yr habit is hard.  I was also thinking that true love is unconditional and comes in  many forms. I love my Husband, not in a "ooh, he has great potential" way, but for all his wonderful human frailities. I feel the same about my best friend. I have known her for about 12 years, and we are like sisters. Not hearts and flowers, real family. Fights, feuds, happy, sad, you name, we have been through it. But all those things are what make love so wonderful, that it can survive all that and come back in its orginal forms.  I feel lucky to have been able to grow and change with the people I love, and that I am safe to do so. That I have been able to see them grow and change as well.  The people I love (Husband, Baby, BestFriend) are incredibly special and wonderful and smart. And even when they dont seem to be so, I love 'em anyway.

Hello, its me, playing with my computer

What the hell is going on in the world when we need news people to remind not to leave our children locked in the car?    It happened again, some evil troll left 2 children in the car for 5 hours to die in the hot sun. I can almost bet she wouldnt have done that to a dog.  So, again this year we see reporters giving us tips on how to remember a   tiny, living   human,  who is relying on us for their very survival, is in the car.   If there was an omnipotent "God", he would strike potential idiots and evil folks who do things even more incomprehensible, sterile. Unfortunately though, no matter how fucked up you are, you can have a baby. It is a right, apparently. I makes me want to cry for people who want to love a child so bad they torture themselves with treatments, because the unworthy breed like fucking flies.   Ok, I feel slightly better for letting that out. Anyhow, I am a told internet nerd. I am a dorky wallflower in the cyber highschool. I swear, it seems just like that. I have never been able to join any chat room or group without someone pissing me off, or just being plain rude. And I just leave, because how stupid is it to get into a typing match with someone who has nothing better to do than attack anonymous people? Its strange. I have joined mothers groups. They are mostly so stupid my head hurts, and never gently correct their urban legend-forwarded-to-everyone posts with actual facts, they hate that. I joined one, that sent me  an extremely  rude email, and I had even posted or anything yet. Its okay, their "join us" letter was full of errors. I used to say that it wasnt the placenta, it was your brain. i am not sure if I was wrong about that. Arent there any smart, sassy, Moms?  Moms who know that they are still people too? I dunno. ooo, back on track. I have been sweared at for having the wrong font,      made fun of for being American (totally offended by that, because I do pride myself on not being typical in that category). How the hell can I break into the cool crowd? I cant. Just like in real life, I am in the corner reading Margaret Atwood, wearing black and hating you :)

Well, update on the Crazy sharing chick.   She quit! I went on vacation, she called in all week. Called me and told me some crazy ass story and quit. I think what disturbs me most about this whole thing is I feel as if I cannot trust my instincts about people at all. We are the same age, she has children. I suppose I projected a level of maturity on her that I shouldnt have. Ok, I am not supposing at all. I do, however, realise that this sort of thing upsets me only because I feel as if I have been on the side of the children who have a Mom who is a little flighty.   I have noticed something of late that disturbs me. I have, for whatever reason, been meeting women who are Mothers, and are seperated from their children. And, I cannot understand it.  Oh crap, i am soo not as eloquent as the blogs I have read (;) Ghost gurl), I need to find my voice. So I will just continue to vomit forth until the path is clear.

When did I become old and uncool? I feel as I always did, but I catch myself thinking "Ooh, you cant wear that anymore. youre too old" or worse, feeling as though I will look like an old chick trying to be young. I feel like a very different kind of nerd than I was before. Funny thing, I dont remember being hip and cool, so it must have been like 5 mins in the 90's I was ok, and then I was on the downward trail to this. hahahaah I think I blinked, 'cause I missed it. Maybe its because I remember when my Mom was my age, and thinking she was so damn old. Now here I am, and I know thats what those younger are thinking. Or not. I dunno. When I turned 30 I was the cool older dame, still young enough to hang, but not so old that I was a bummer (ooh, I know this little slang is dating me. Its like Quincy trying to "rap" with the punks on a VSE).  Then I got wierd, eccentric old, dangerously close to house full of cats, etc. Very Bridget Jones, without the great accent or the Mr Darcy.  Then I got married, and I was still freewheeling. I think what happened was the mother thing. Now other people see me in a way I never imagined. I am someones Mommy, so people see me as a parent.  Oh fuck other people anyhow, I never really liked them much.  Just a general malaise tonight. I like the show Nip/Tuck, if only because I am inordinately fascinated with plastic surgery. And one of the actors is sex on a cracker. mmmmm   I miss my HBO. But, with Oz gone, I had to give it up. I loved that damn crazy show. I know, I am a nutburger.  ooh, but I do like Court Tv. I have to  admit that I dont watch as much as I used to, but hell, I cant stop. And all the damn crime shows. Every "Law and Order" they can come up with. Hell, I'd probably watch "Law & Order: the hall monitor years". I 'm a geek. CSI  is ok, if sometimes factually incorrect and silly. Without a Trace is a complete fabrication, but a little fun. And I always like Anthony Lapaglia. Now, I am an entertainment critic. ahahahah I declared my job a JLO free zone, but the people who do our mix cds did not get the memo. Ugh, the dreck they compilate is awful.  Then, I catch people singing to it. Or worse yet, I sing to it because I have heard it an infinite number of times and it is now like that worm they put in your ear in a Star Trek movie and is boring into my brain! HEllpppp meee . I need sleep.   or coffee. probably both

Poor-Spelling Children Pay Dearly for "Letters to Satan"     Little Rock--The nation's educational crisis has taken a poignant twist this Christmas, as thousands of poor-spelling children have unwittingly addressed their "Letters to Santa" to Satan and suffered tragic consequences.   Ten-year-old Sally Ryder mistakenly asked Satan for a pony and was trampled to death by the Budweiser Clydesdales at a football game. In Minnesota, six-year-old Timmy Brattle, hoping for a TonkaTM fire-truck, was killed in a four-alarm blaze that a whole company of bright, shiny pumpers could not extinguish. And hundreds of children asking Satan for Legos have found themselves buried alive inside colorful, pricey tombs made of the famous inter-locking bricks.   Postmaster General, Sarah Smith, has spent most of the past week scrambling to defend her employees: "Look, we just deliver the mail. The return bestowal of gifts, or alternatively, an eternity of hellfire and torment is left up to the recipient." She continued, "My advice is for everyone to work on their spelling. We've seen quite a few letters to 'Santa, Reaver of Souls' lately, and I'm sure Chris Cringle has no idea what to do with the talismans and chicken guts he's getting."   Poor Shannon was torn apart by two rabid giggopets. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Bennett exploded in his bed four days after mailing this letter. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   As a reward for his insolence, little Stephen has ascended to the throne of Saudi Arabia.    hahaahah I got this from "The Spark" DArn funny



well, the last thing didnt post. Oh well, I cut and pasted just like it said. Damn it all

Afhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  I cant beleive this. My husband works for another store in my company. He has a goatee. Someone working for me has a mustache,and another manager has a goatee. They have told him our DM wants him to shave his.What the fuck?  Please , the handbook says you can have neatly trimmed facial hair, and I had a GIRL working for me with a beard.  I am extremely upset and annoyed by the company for this. But I cant fight his battles. Or can I? I dont beleive that the DM would say that, and I want to call her and ask her what gives, but I dont want to rock the boat too much. Jeez, this is ridiculous.

Go to this site ( I suck at the HTML, so its cut and paste time cats and kittens!!)   www.nerslut.net  Funny, cool. You'll likey!

Yes , I have gone back and edited some of the more crazy boring stuff from this week.  No quizzes these last 2 posts hahahahah   Maybe I am cured. No, I cant help it its fun, and I must face facts that I only know of 1 person who reads this, so it is really just a vanity page. I get to soapbox my thoughts, and feel content knowing that at least somewhere they are out there. But I know that no one is paying attention. I am almost tempted to just write in the style of a letter to the one I know reads this.   Oh well, that is the feeling today. So much to do, the world is so big, I am so small and ineffectual. The boring truth is, I need to clean my house and finish unpacking and DO something, but I always just want to veg out and get a little time to myself while the house is quiet.   No crime there, cant beat myself up about it :)

Wow, what a day. I feel like a huge weenie. I got shocked at work and had to have the paramedics come, and they wanted me to go to the hospital. And, in the middle of it all, a woman yelled at us because her coffee took too long! What the hell is wrong with people?  NOTE TO CONSUMERS:    If you are frequenting places like St*rB**ks or Cof** Be*N or any place where someone behind the counter has to make it for you: THe people serving you are human beings, not mindless automatons, not your Mr Coffee pot from home covered in a flesh like substance. If you cannot wait, stay home and make it. If you need to be mean to people to feel good about yourself, get therapy. Bottom line, if the worst thing that happens in your day is having to wait for a fucking cup of coffee, you are damn lucky.  Oh, and this applies to any service-related job. And when you get pissed and yell at us, like your talking to retarded children or like we dont speak english, we dont care. You will never get what you want that way, you only create a huge chain of bad will and Karma for yourself, which will perpetuate your horrible, self centered evilness.  And fuck off, by the way

One Science Fair, Under God IHS technical guru Mary Ellen Sikes passed on this little Web gem, showcasing the winners of the 2001 Creation Science Fair.   Prize winners include:   Elementary School Level -- 1st Place: "My Uncle Is A Man Named Steve (Not A Monkey)." Cassidy Turnbull (grade 5) presented her uncle, Steve. She also showed photographs of monkeys and invited fairgoers to note the differences between her uncle and the monkeys. She tried to feed her uncle bananas, but he declined to eat them. Cassidy has conclusively shown that her uncle is no monkey.  Middle School Level -- 2nd Place: "Women Were Designed For Homemaking." Jonathan Goode (grade 7) applied findings from many fields of science to support his conclusion that God designed women for homemaking: physics shows that women have a lower center of gravity than men, making them more suited to carrying groceries and laundry baskets; biology shows that women were designed to carry unborn babies in their wombs and to feed born babies milk, making them the natural choice for child rearing; social sciences show that the wages for women workers are lower than for normal workers, meaning that they are unable to work as well and thus earn equal pay; and exegetics shows that God created Eve as a companion for Adam, not as a co-worker.  The site also claims to be dedicated to the shutdown of the Landover Baptist Church parody Web site.  Creation "science" fair. Thats stretching it a bit. I hope this was a parody, as suspected. Oh, this is definitely NOT a parody:   www.ooze.com/toolofsatan I almost dont want to give them any mention, but it is just so damned funny, I cant help it. Why in the world would you waste your time like this? MMM, isnt their "goD" so all powerful that his light would shine brighter than a lightsaber? I take Yoda any day baby.

OK, yesterday I was writing some shite about actors and stupidity and just plain crap, but I have to tell you that tonight I am sobbing and sad because of this:http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/AIDS/ I cant even come up with the words about how sad and awful this is, and  I wish we could find a way to stop it. It took a dear, sweet, funny friend of mine just recently as well, and it breaks my heart that people can die like this. It breaks my heart that when I told someone why he had died, they automatically said "oh, was he gay, or a drug addict?" Guess what, it can get anyone, anywhere. It is sad that a man who lived to be a hundred is eulogized for 2 fucking days in the news, but people are callous to children dying. Oh, by the way, that woman who called the family in Indiana to say that she was their missing daughter is EVIL. If there is a hell, there is a special place for her there.

I hate the fact that I find myself thinking of death too much. At odd times, too. It just seems like anything, any freak thing, can happen at any time. It's just too fucking random for me to deal with. I am constantly afraid of cancer, or a brain hemmorage or such. I think I watch too many medical shows. I KNOW I watch too many medical shows. Its like I am constantly a first year med student, I have everything. Jeez. It's actually kinda funny, now that I see it here in print.

Whoo hoo! I would like to think all those emails made a difference, but the truth is people who are much braaver than I actually  did  something. Thanks. :)

PLEASE DO THIS   AMINA LAWAL SET TO BE STONED The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the  death sentence for Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of adultery on  August 19th 2002, to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death. Her  death was postponed so that she could continue to nurse her baby. A hearing  on her Execution is now set for 25 SEPTEMBER 2003. If you haven't been  following this case, you might like to know that Amina's baby is regarded  as the 'evidence' of her adultery.   Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of Amnesty  International, which is attempting to put together enough signatures to  make the Nigerian government rescind the death sentence. A similar campaign  saved another Nigerian woman, Safiya, condemned in similar circumstances.  By March 4th the petition had amassed over 2,600,000 signatures It will  only take you a few seconds to sign Amnesty's online petition. Please  sign the petition now, then copy this message into a new email and send it  to everyone in your address book.    Amnesty International    ok, yes a copy, but if it gets it out there one more time, thats all i can hope for :)

 Project:Denny's - Trophy Room  Hey, guess what, crazy folks? Charles Manson ordered a strawberry shake at Denny's the night they commited one of their crimes. Denny's sucks. And I should know, I worked there long enough.

I am so sad for us.  I say us, because I watched it.  TV will do anything for ratings and money, even exploit people and their sad weaknesses and vanity.  The latest example, or rather, the one I saw, was called "Extreme Makeover". I have talked here before about my crazy fascination with surgery. More importantly, plastic surgery. Plastic is the operative  term here. Fake, facade, prettifying to cover up a deeper issue. Well, this was awwful. This  man was getting surgery, completely  facially transforming surgery,  to get a girl to like him !  An adult man, and it made me so sad that he felt so awful about himself that if he physically transformed  she would love him. Why would he want someone who only cared about how he looked? I am at a loss. Dont get me wrong, all of us have done silly things and vain  things in the name of attracting a partner.  But to let someone cut your face open, and suck fat out of you and make yourself completely unrecognizable? Whoa. But that was only one of the "contestants" as it were. Apparently, people line up in droves to flash their flab and beg to be cut up on national TV. It's worse than "Queen for a Day".   The other story was about some twins. They kept referring to one as "the prettier twin". Seriously.  They were actually estranged because of the rift caused by one being less attractive. From some of the things they said, their parents felt that way too, because only one got braces. And the "pretty" one did not have her sister in her wedding, presumably because she was unattractive. Well, they have reconnected over breast implants and tummy tucks. How sweet.  And, these people left small children and families for 2 months to do it. Warms your heart, eh?   They should have a show called "Extreme Therapy", because that is what is so needed here.    Also, on the eve  of yet another Woody Allen film coming out, I cant understand how actors  still want to be in his movies!! He married his daughter for Christs sake!  Hello, did everyone miss that part of the show? Ok, technically not his daughter, but he was the father figure in the home and it is sick. If he wasnt  who he is, it would be a freaking Jerry Springer episode. A Law and Order. Something on CourtTV. Beleive me baby, I know. But, everyone forgives and forgets.  Roman Polanski cant enter the country, Woody Allen is on the street with his wife/daughter, and their  children (lets hope Soon Ye doesnt find any pictures in her sock drawer as did Mama Mia, I mean, they are adopted children right? not really his? Arent they fair game for marriage?). No, I am not defending Polanski's actions, but how different is what each of them did, thats all I'm saying. Alot of actors I had respect for continue to disappoint me by working for him.

Ok, I have lamented in the past that I have no voice,and that I treat this as kind of an open letter.... Generally, doubting myself as I tend to do.  Well, I have been enlightened.

Thats right, I am a total Ghostie copy cat. So sue me! I am depressed. I am usually a very worried type of chick. I stress alot. Well, I had an epiphany of sorts in the past week, and realize that none of this work shit I bother with matters in life. My family and my relationships matter. Why worry about something that is really of no consequence? Its money, not who I am. The world will not end if I am not perfect, or always there. I actually have a life, wow. Anyhow, I just want to quit. I want to have another baby and quit and never wear shoes again.   Thanks to feminism, that is a choice, not a requirement. Thanks Gloria Steinem! :)

 The Haunted Head Oh where oh where has my little dog gone, or where oh where can she be?   hhhahahah

I swear to fucking doG that I am never getting my hair cut again. I cant beleive how awful I look. Like (dont be offended out there) the stero typical dyke. I am six feet tall, with hair about 1 inch all over, becaus some stupid twat at Fantastic Sams cant figure out the picture I showed her. Then, when I went back to talk to her manager, she slammed her finger on a page in the book I showed her, one with the closest thing she could find, and fucking LIED. Its too short, uneven. I apologized to my son that his Mommy looks like she could be his Daddy. They cant even fix it, because there is nothing to fix. I cried on the way out.  Oooh, she did however, go of on a coworker who was wearing a skimpy out fit, saying "those people get killed". ooh, great.  What I have learned   NEVER go to the Mcdonalds of hair, expecting to come out looking even remotely cute.  THOSE ADS LIE  they wont do it like  the picture, hell the chicks can barely read english anyway ( at least where I was)

ah, I gave him enough free space. Be gone, scum!

The UCI college proffesor, who left his 10 mth old son in his car to die this past summer, will not be charged with anything criminal. And that, my friends, is criminal. The justification is that it was an accident. What? You forgot? no problem , its only a helpless little person.  The article I read said that if the parent simply "forgets", they are not negligent. If they say they thought someone else had the kids, they are. What the fuck? I cant beleive it is so arbitrary. Also, they say the parents are punished enough.   To add to this little horror, his wife is not mad at him. Uhh, what? Even more awful, these people went through 5 years of fertility treatments to conceive this little boy that they let down in the most heinous of ways. Why oh why does no one consider that maybe there is a reason they cannot have children, and accept it for what it is? They werent meant to have kids, they forced it, and obviously they blew it. THEY WERE NOT MEANT TO HAVE CHILDREN> Its not for everyone, and I respect so much all the people I know who realize and acknowledge that. Who actually think before they do it. Novel concept, to be sure, but so necessary. These are lives, not possesions. Not little copies of you to feed your ego. They are little, indivdual people.   I have to go now, my little person needs juice.

Ok, dammit here it is:http://profiles.yahoo.com/luminousthings cut and paste, see the freaks!!!!!

Hi.  I have a new quest, one that I hope everyone can help me with. I have a Yahoo messenger account, that I use to play trivia games in trivia chat rooms. I frequently am IMd asking for asl, and playing coy games designed to get me to cyber them. I have had a million stupid questions asked of me about my nicks.   So, in a fit of rage and just being plain fed up, I posted the following in my profile: (paraphrased)" For all you internet trollers out there: Just because I am a woman does not mean I want to be part of your sad little masturbation fantasy. And I think I speak for alot"  So, I am online, not even thinking about it, and I get this IM from someone called  luminousthings   that reads "why did you put something so ugly in your profile".  Now, little Mister  luminousthings    has no sense of humor. I typed back "why do you care, did I ruin your plans" or something to that effect. But even when I tried to explain, he just got more pissed off. Why? Why even bother with me? And, he obviously was trolling. Jeez. I called him and asshole and he actually called me a potty mouth! Ok, so I got  more than a little upset that he is so self righteous as to tell me what I can and cannot have in my profile, and it just pissed me off because who fucking cares and how dare you write me a message anyway? Agghh.  At any rate, I logged on today and received this offline message from luminousthings  : " I am glad to see you changed your profile" (I removed the message, fuck em all anyhow) Now I am REALLY mad! What a dick! he came back! he actually was so "offended" he checked my profile again. What an asshole. So, everyone, I implore you to send your opnion to  luminousthings@yahoo.com , a let him know, as I have, that there are much worse things on the net than that little message, and we all should tell him how we feel about his little bit of self righteous crap. remember its  luminousthings@yahoo.com  If you have yahoo messenger, so much the better. Yes, we are all entitled to our own opinions. But, as we all know, they are like assholes and everyon has one and they all stink and you should keep it to yourself.

OH my, I love that guy sooooooooooooo much. The bitch of it all is that I cannot retaliate until I learn more html. Curses!!

October       Which month are you?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Okay ghostie, see, I cant help but follow like a little puppy. I am begining to suspect we do these just to see how the other is dooing . hahahahha

well, I have been meaning to write this for awhile, how I cant even watch the "news" (which is just jlo and ben crap anyway. or horrible tragedies. Or the next cancer causing agent) anymore, without getting horribly sad. I hate to know that evil, bad things are happening to people, it hurts me. I met some people who called it "world pain", and proffess (?) to be into esp  and the like. I like that term for it, and do have a lot of empathy, but I find it hard to beleive that it comes from being some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi, feeling all the souls on Aldderon when it exploded. I am no Jedi, man. Hahahahha Guess I let my geek flag fly on that one. Oh well. I would so like to be able to help people, but I know I get to attached to the problems of others, and tend to want to take them on myself.  Oh, well, back to pondering the universe and such.:)

I have issues with...        religion  father  discipline  society  fame         Take Word Association Test   What a damn sheep I am, I cant help it. I think it's my issues with fame. I cant handle it. mmm

ooh, my son is playing with my Gary Oldman doll. I am such a geek, I mean does anyone even know they made a doll of Dracula. Whatta nerd.  I am sad, because I was had by an 18 year old. This kid was working for me, and I sat and talked with him about why he was performing so poorly at work.  I  got a huge sob story about alchol abuse, his family, eating disorders bla bla bla. I was trying to be nice, and offered him our company help lines and conselours and such. I found out he was playing me, and thought that because of the conversation, he could do anything and not get fired. He basically told everyone I was a chump. Plus, he said I was mean and never gave him breaks. Good lord, being the boss sucks. I just feel really stupid, because I usually dont fall for this stuff, but he went for my emotional soft spots. What an asshole. Oh well, everyone cant be as fabulous as me and my friends. It's sad, really.

okay, I am only including this because of the cute GIR picture. I love him   You're GIR! I bet you always answered every question having to do with GIR, right? He's funny, has a sense of...well, a little bit of humor, he doesn't really think well, but he's funny.

Merry Christmas Everyone! Today, no hating.   I love Christmas, in all it's commericialized, secular glory! I have actually told my son that we dont beleive in virgin birth in my house. So, I just love all the other stuff. Also, I love all my friends and family all year, and let them know as often as possible. But I love to give gifts and decorate and be annoyingly happy as well.  :)

More things I hate:  Overuse  and misuse of the words:  random trifiling (sp?) nuclear (its pronounced new-cleer. ) female ( I find this more offensive than bitch sometimes. It seems to sterile, like youre sexing chickens. stop it guys)

Turducken? Ok, nothing with the word "turd" in it shall pass my lips. 'Nuff said.  I am thinking of things I hated in the past year. Lets all reflect.  Bennifer super low rise jeans (on anyone, but mostly on those who shouldnt) Rich kid chic (hello, I dont care about any of you, now kindly fuck off) Jillian Barbarie (I am a masochistic, because I still will turn that freaking show on. I call it the whore show. Hey, babe, your older than I am. Stop dressing like your 22, wash your face, read a real book. Then you can be on TV) Talk shows ( not everyone and their grandma who had 15 mins needs a freaking talk show. Lets face it, times up)  Ok, all I can think of now. I know you will be waiting breathlessly for more. Suffer pigs!!!

I am deep in the jungle of The TErrible Twos, and my brain is turning to jelly. The bamboo slivers of toddlerhood are embedded under my fingernails, and I am sure I have  jungle rot. Send help. SEnd supplies. Send a babysitter so I can go to a movie.

ooh, everyone, gather  round. I would like to welcome 2 new, actual readers of my blog, bringing to grand total to 4.   I am getting a little crowd shy now. mmmmm

Okay. is is wrong to sign up for odd things on the internet using the emails of people you dont like? It is only a little, sad bit of  evil.

Hooligan Bear       Which Dysfunctional Care Bear Are You?     brought to you by   Quizilla     I am so not Hoooligan bear. But, I love the word hooligan. so there

I guess that entry was a tad more maudlin than I meant it to be. I do have different dreams now. I want to buy a house, I want to raise a wonderful human being.  I have been entrusted with someone's life, and that is most important to me right now.  And that is a great, beautiful thing.  I do not wish that anything was different. I love my family, and my friends.  I was just thinking about other stuff, I guess. My career goals are to be the best Mom I could ever be, and I think my review for that is much more important. I think I am more scared by the fact that work doesnt matter to me anymore. It is a job. Life is so much more important. I dont want to waste my time away from work worrying about it anymore. It just doesnt matter all that much, who ever wished they spent more time at work?

mmm..... So, today, I am much less bitter than my last entry. But, whatever. Ok, I am just a naturally bitter, sarcastic person. I cannot help  it really. It is a sickness.  But, I am not sure if that is right, because my cynical side has had it's ass kicked by a little boy. It's true. He came in and gave me hope and brought in light. And I am not ashamed of my newfound closet Pollyana status. I am actually a happy person now. So I find it hard to find things to be upset about sometimes, and I think I make them up .  Well, blow things up, out of proportion. I am not used to being content, it throws me. I have watched way too many movies. As soon as things go well, something else turns to shit. But, I realize that is just a dramatic device used by filmmakers  to suck us in. I have actually,save for that post, been quite zen about it all. Customers bother me, I say "it's only coffee". This is my new mantra. I actually feel sad for most of the folks that come in and act to badly. I think they must be unhappy. It is actually easier to be content than it was to be  pissed off all those years. But, now I realize that allot of the things I dreamt of are not to be. I must now have other dreams I guess. I wanted to be a writer, but I have trouble writing.  I also wanted to write a memoir of my crazy childhood, but everyone is doing that. It's  been done to death. But dont you want to read stories of alligator farms and homes for wayward girls? I think so.  I used to want to be an actress, but I live in a place where theater is dead. Serious theatre seems to be dying anyway. It's all about turning movies into fabulous shows. I cant beleive they are actually making a "Producers" movie. Which was a show based on a movie. Redundant? I wish I had gone to medical school. I should have gone to college straight out of high school and actually used my brain. Instead, it atrophies selling coffee drinks to  upper middle class   brats, and women full of botox. However, I would not have what I have today if my path had been different, would I? I would not have a fabulous husband or the sweetest little boy on feet, now would I?  I will never know, because I made different choices. I think we all tell ourselves that things are meant to be the way they are, because we dont want to think about how we made the wrong choices.  We want to rationalize our lifes. As Jeff Goldblum said "Try going a week without a good rationalization" So true.

Guess what you get when you stress out, miss important appoinments, work on you son's 1st birthday, work for 1 month with only 2 days  off (one is your birthday, the other your bankruptcy), and have the highest sales percentage over last year in the entire company?  NOTHING I will not be getting a raise. Any raise. Zip, zilch, nada.  Today, I got my year review, a big goose egg. I also am getting written up and put on an "Individual Development Plan. "   Well, bully for me. Hey, corporate coffee, you can suck my nose 'til my head caves in. Have a nice day. (I am so angry, I cannot find the right words. again.)

But, Peter Lawford is cool. He did Marilyn. Sweet.

Ok. Why is it that all the conservatives are talking about protecting the "sanctity of marriage" for heterosexuals? Why has no one commented about Britteny Spears, JenniferLopez, or Elizabeth Taylor and what they have done with the "sanctity" of it all? If you love each other, and are consenting, adults of whatever sex, you should be able to be married. End of story. Hell, heteros have been getting it wrong for years, come on now. Why are these people so scared of people who love? There is not enough love in the world most times, so embrace it in all its forms.  Would that be so bad? nO!

Not to be preachy, but things are a happening that could put us back to the coat hanger days. NO! If you want to , get involved. Oh, a little aside on this front. I saw a man driving a truck with the licsence plate NOABORT, and of course, various references to jesus everywhere. I want ed to  pull him out of his car and beat him with a stick (a small stick, I dont want to hurt him allot. Some welts, ok, sure) for even thinking he could say anything, him being a man and all. Please. Personally, I am scaared to think of all the anti choice people breeding anyway. They are the same ones buying ticket to the passion of the christ, and taking small children with them.

She is that  child singer/actress that didnt get cast as Annie, slightly older. Someone slap her parents for continuing to baby her. Jesus. Anyhow. I tried a few weeks ago to do something good, and sign up to be type matched for the National bone marrow registry. i was rejected, because of my asthma. I almost cried. I felt all sad, cause I got up my little courage and everything and wanted to help and now I cant.  So, I guess I will go back to being a curmudgen.

I found something odd at the store the other day. I went to Walmart, which is ok, but it is like a white trash time warp when you go in there. Its like 1975 kmart all over again. It is a fascinating place to people watch, seriously. Anyway, I went to the Easter  candy aisle. I am not of any particular religion, its all bunnies and such for me. If pressed I think of it as a Pagan ritual. But, its just tradition. During my childhood, I spent every Easter with my atheist father, so I didnt know it had any religious connotations until I was 10. I just knew I got a heck of allot of chocolate, and a spiffy new dress.  In the aisle, were "Ressurection eggs" (sp?). They were plastic eggs filled with grails, crosses , praying hands, etc. Please. I actually ate chocolate crucifixes once! And they were totally sacrilicious!! hahahahaha   Just seems odd to me. And strangely funny, because I am a little twisted in my sense of humor. I know, shocking!!

So, the other day, I wrote an eloquent and fabulous post about how we are teaching our daughters the wrong values with shows like "the Swan" and such. But, I hit the wrong button, and it disappeared in a puff of smoke.  I am in serious danger of being an old codger, I think. Now, I only ever watch the bad auditions parts of american idol, not the faux competition of medicore high school drama/choir talent. I can say that, because I was in choir in high school, and people who sang like that always bugged me. But someone wins, and its all over my little tv set, while they are getting their carnival act/performing animal butt kissed. So it happens that the 19 year old winner has a 2 year  old daughter. Okay, this bothers me, and I am not afraid to say it. She is no ones idol. Furthermore, she has spent months of time away from her child to persue her own ridiculous version of fame. And in 6 months, when no one cares anymore, you wasted part of their childhood so you could feel better about yourself. Maybe she would feel better about herself if she had kept her pants on in high school. I know this is harsh, but I am so tired of all these teenage Moms, talking about needing their own lives. You dont really get that too much after you have a child, which is why you should wait until you are older to have one.  Oh, and for all the prison Moms: why should I care that now you are separated from your children, and spend my tax dollars to fund programs for you? Where was all your concern when you were out committing crimes? Why werent you thinking of them then? AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Ok, I feel better now. Sort of. And just for the record, I did not have an idyllic childhood, and just wished my Mom had been home more. So I know all about this from a childs perspective. Kids dont care about money or fame. They want to spend as much time as possible with their parents. Preferably both, preferably grown ups.

My last cat of the 3 that I have had for almost 10 years does not want to live with us anymore. 2 of them died last year, one quickly (I am not sure what of. I think he ate something bad), the other a protracted illness (liver went kaput. The vet said it is common in older cats.). This one is 10 years old, and he has always been an indoor cat. He has now decided he is an outdoor cat, and now rarely comes inside the house. When he does, he eats, then cries to get out. He is a large guy, with claws, so he can defend himself. I think he deserves some outdoor life in his twilight years, he is fixed,and we dont live right on the road. But I know in my heart that he is preparing to go away for good, to find a nice soft patch of earth and go to sleep for good. I just am sad about it.

Whoo Hoooo   I am free from the evil she beast running rampant at the Coffee bean and tea leaf.   I am still decompressing, of course. I am having dreams and such. But I am so glad I dont have to go back there I can hardly contain myself.   I am a little scared about money, but I am so Zen about it. Strange, since if you look in the dictionary next to worry, my picture is there.      I have a beautiful little boy to take care of, and another sweetie on the way, so I am staying in the moment for now. Catch me in a few weeks. Actually, this morning I woke up to a call back on a job for my husband, one he thought he wouldnt get, so things are on the upswing.      :)

Sometimes I think that if my Mother was still alive I wouldn't be as free to be who I am now. Of course, it has forever changed me, as it would anyone. But I know that I would not have been free to look at the remnants of my childhood in quite the same bright light. I spent alot of time trying to revise things, to act like it was all ok and that she was perfect. She wasnt. She was human. And that is a fine thing, and I love her and miss her more than anything. Not a day goes by that I dont think of her, or see something and think "she would love that". Especially my son. But finally, after 10 years, I am begining to accept it. Sort of.    I love you, Mama. Warts and all :)

So, Jessica Simpsons mother is telling Vanity Fair that Jessicas IQ is in the 160s. Sure it is.Oh my Lord, I have to hold back the rising tide of disbeleiving vomit that wants to rise from my throat and cover these people in rancid stomach acids.

Well, I had a lawyer tell me he wouldnt take the case because although it is obvious that my DM had it in for me, and just did not like me after I went to HR about the baby sitting comment. He said its perfectly legal for her to be an asshole, and let her personal feelings go wild. So, I dont know what to do. I am going to talk to someone else (he did say someone else may take the case), see what I can do. At the very least she violated the company's no retalitation policy. I just really want her not to be able to do this to anyone else. I am starting to worry, and I have to work tomorrow. But, trust me, nothing will actually get done, I can assure you.I am almost positive she will come in a give me the boot. Thats okay, they have to pay me until next Thursday anyway.

Well, I quit my job. And got the bums rush, even though I offered to stay to help after I gave my notice. No acknowledgement of offer, just, hey we got someone to take over your store, see ya, bye. Thanks Coffee Bean and TEa Leaf. Thanks for totally torturing me, and treating me like shit for the past 7 months. I enjoyed it. Now, I can collect unemployment, and go foward with my discrimination suit. Weeeeeeee. You can suck my cock, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Go to their website, tell them how you feel...

I am having a huge internal crisis of late. I am being so pushed/pulled a by my job. On one hand, I have been told I am too nice. On the other hand, apparently people have complained about my meanness. So which is true? It can pull the rug from under you when your employer keeps changing the rules to fit their view of you, bringing up new things they never told you, to keep you on edge. I have been hating this job for at least 6 months, when I was told I hadnt done a damn thing all year. Now, someone hates my guts. I  have never had anyone be so angry with me as this new hire who just quit. He would not even look at me. And I cannot figure out why or what buttons I may have pushed in his psyche over the last 2 weeks that sent him into the bad  place. He refused to talk to me about it, to give me a chance to make it right, to do anything. He acts like I ran over his mother. And my Dms reaction to this ? "other people have said this about you, you are why people leave".Thanks, I feel soooooooooooo  much better. Please come in and fire me. I swear, I will cry tears of releif when she does. But,I dont think she will, I think she is trying to make it so awful I quit, because if you fire a pregnant girl, you are open for lawsuits. Which I would sue, cause I hate her. Oh well. I am just looking towards my new baby, trying to find ways to relax (I am having work nightmares all the time now.It sucks), playing with my son. (And my husband, hee hee) Thank goodness we will be moving next April. To somewhere where I will have an actual, bona fide friend ( ie, a person with no hidden agendas, who loves me just as I am), and be able to afford 2 kids. At any rate, I have had a few job interviews, but by the time I start any of them I will be showing, and I havent even told them I'm pregnant. Of course not, they cant ask anyway. Oh me oh my.

That is correct, I am finding strange things online. I dont have the time or opportunity to do this very often, so I do it when I can. I had a job interview today. I told my current employer I had to go to the dentist. I almost feel guilty, its that __ close, baby. I am just waiting to be fired. Get it over with already. Why prolong it, my goodness. I cant stand it anymore. I want to collect unemployment . I think they may be wise to my ploy, and are just being a pain. At any rate, i am up for 2 pretty decent jobs. But, I want to be a full time Mommy. So there.
