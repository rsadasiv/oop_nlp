I guess I'm one of the cool kids now. I have a blog. :-P

Ok, so this is going to be my little venting session because I know my sister can't read/probably won't ever see this. Can you guess what its about??? Yeah.   My sister.    If any of you have an older sibling you know what its like. I love her and all, but lately all she has been doing is just critisizing me to hell. Everything I own, everything I do, anything that relates to me in any way, even if I can't control it, she puts down. And I'm getting really sick of it. It's gotten to the point where I just want to get away from her, go off to college so I won't have to see her anymore. So I won't have to deal with her shit.   I was discussing this a little with Randy *her bf* a few minutes ago, and she(and he) seems to be mad at the fact that my mom likes Matt better than Randy. Which is not true. My mom doesn't even know Matt. The only thing she has ever said to me about him is that he is attractive. She doesn't talk much about Randy, but I can understand what false impression she might get of him by my sisters constant complaining about things he does. But she doesn't hate him.  I'm a lot like my mom was in high school, never having any boyfriends, but having lots of friends that are guys. *minus the small factor that the majority of my guy friends are gay* No that I have a ton of guy friends.... but nonetheless thats not the point. HER sister, on the other hand, constantly had a boy. I don't get boyfriends. Angela's had one for going on 4 years. I think that my mom just knows what its like to be alone, under the influence of a constantly attatched sibling. And she's happy that I have a boyfriend now. Its new and exciting and she's glad for me. Not that I ever talk to her about my relationship/Matt anyway, but thats irrelevant also. But she can relate to me, and I am so much like her its scary.  So I think Angela's jealous in a way. She wants mom to be excited for her and Randy like she is for me. But, they've been together for so long that its nothing to be excited about anymore.     And she also is angry at the fact that I don't really "follow the rules" and I'm not such a goody goody ms. perfect like she is. I lie to my parents, I go out till all hours of the night, I have a life and friends and will do anything to keep it that way. I don't get in trouble, and its not like I'm doing anything illegal. But she, doesn't really have any friends. Not around here anyway. And she doesnt really have a life.   She told me how stupid she thought it was that we all cried at graduation.  I wanted to punch her in the face and be all "Fuck you, thats just because you didnt have any friends in high school!!" which she didn't. She had Randy, and Ian, and Putnam and Cam. And thats it. But I have so many and I love them all. She's just jealous, I know. High school sucked for her, and I'm sorry, but my high school was awsome and I loved it. I'm going to miss it a lot. I want to say something to Randy, and I probably will eventually, but I know it'll just get back to her. Because that stuff happens with them. So I have to be real careful what I say to him nowadays.   She doesn't accept me and accept my life. It pisses her off for some reason, and I'm not trying to seek her approval on anything so I really don't care. But at the same time I don't want her to critisize everything in my life. I don't even ask her opinion and she throws it in my face. I don't think she realizes how much it affects me. I don't go around trashing everything she thinks and does. I keep my opinions to myself unless necessary.   She doesn't approve of Matt and our relationship, she doesn't like my clothes, or my choice of bedding for college, or the color of my room, or my music, or anything else. Can you possibly imagine why I don't talk to her about my life? I listen to all of her bitching and complaining and tales of her college life or drama with people, but I don't tell her a single thing about what is going on in my world. She knows the basics, yes, because some things you're going to learn when being sisters with someone. But she isn't even a part of my personal life. I try to tell her things and she just doesn't listen. So I gave up on that a long time ago. Thats what my friends are there for, to listen and to comfort me and to be there for me. Family is supposed to do that too, but my family pretty much sucks at being close and at all family like, so I have to overcompensate with my friends. I think I'd kill myself if I didn't have you guys.   Versus, why I'm going away to college and never coming home. *at least, not very often* I love my family and all but, they aren't really a family. They're like distant relatives that I happen to live with. I feel like I can't really fix things now. Its not worth the effort. My friends are my family. They are all I need to survive.

This just came to me: You know how your parents always make a big deal about the first word you eve said? Could a person's first word have any effect on the type of person they turn out to be? I wonder...           I know for a fact that my first word was "shit." No joke.       What was your first word? Let's compare!

Today I hung out with Jenna and had a really good time. We went to stalk Amy as usual, but as usual se wasn't home and didn't answer her cell. It's really starting to irritate me. I mean, she tells me to call her, so I do. The only problem is that she NEVER PICKS UP, and even when she is home she stil doesn't return my calls. It's called common courtesy people.       Anyway, getting back to the whole Jenna thing- we went to Al's on a hunch that she'd be working. She wasn't. That didn't stop us from eating 9 dollars worth of french fries and "onion nuggets" (SOOOOO GOOD!) Fortunately, I didn't eat all day just in case, so I didn't have any guilt ;^p After that, we went back to her house and watched  Bring It On.  OH! and we changed Jenna's message on her phone. It's awesome. Every single one of you MUST call her phone and hear it. I'm not joking.           Well, I must be off. I have to go pick up the sushi I'm having for dinner. Sushi=Joy.   *hugs*

Our new appliances just got here, and the fridge is too big. The salesman gave us the wrong measurements. My mom is   pissed!   This on top of the fact that my two litle cousins ae spending the week her driving her NUTS. I think she might spontaneously combust, so I'm gonna run. Talk to you later! *hugs*

I just pulled my 4th all-nighter in a row this week (or last week. Whatever.)  This time I became bored around like 4:45. So I got up, put my contacts in, and did what I  pretty much always do when I'm bored. I took a walk at 5 in the morning.       It's been so cool in the morning. When I went out side it smelled like fall. I saw one tree already with turned leaves. This made me very afraid. Then I reasoned that it was WAY too early for me to be thinking about school, and kept on going. now that I think about it, I want school to start, and yet I don't. But I'm sure you've all been there before...       I actually just got back from said walk. It's a little cool out for late July, but it's relatively tolerable. It was nice walking down 27 because everyone was so friendly, especially when you consider the ungodly hour that we were all out. The road was pretty much deserted with the exception of the occasional jerk going 60 ( MAN I hate that!) I ended up walking all over town. It was nice to just be able to walk down the quiet street, not worrying about unfortunate tourists asking for directions, traffic, etc. It just gave me time to think, as cliche as that sounds.       In other news, my mom and I decided that in a week or two when my dad takes my brothers to Boy Scout Camp *shudder* we are going to go to New York. We're most likely going to take a train down there, and stay for a week or so. I'm very  very    very   happy about this. *Does little jig around the room* OH! which reminds me- I think I'm going to go with the vintage black and white, somewhat vogue-ish New York theme in my room. I can't wait!       Now I shall leave you all, as my mom just asked if I'd keep her company while she goes on her walk around town and such. Talk to you all later! *hugs!*

Italy's surprise birthday party ( that I helped plan) was today. Overall I'd say it went well. I don't know, I guess I'm not really that close to all of them anymore. Whatever. It happens...       I really do NOT want to spend the night at home. Someone save me from this Hell. I Just found out that my aunt and uncle are going to be staying through tomorrow ( I was pleasently surprised that my uncle's 4 kids didn't end up coming!) and maybe going to Water Country. I just don't know if I want to go.       I'm desperately craving caffeine right now. You know that  it's-summer-and-I-just-spent-the-entire-day-swimming-in-the-sun tired? That's what I'm feeling right now. It will wear off in like 30 minutes or so, but I really don't want to wait that long.     Oh! Remember how I asked you all your opinion on the room theme thing? Does anyone have any input whatsoever? I'm kinda stuck b/c  I like them both, so I'm looking for what you all have to say.        Another random note: Congratulations to Krystal and Amanda! You guys are so cute! *beams*       I'm off to think of something to do/someplace to go tonight. Give me a call if you already ahve an idea, hahaha. Talk to you later. *hugs*

I had this dream last night where I was watching myself look down on my own funeral. It was weird, because I was watching myself look at all the people there ( which was odd, because I know there wouldn't be a lot of people in actuality) and I could see them crying, but I could tell that the version of myself that I was looking at didn't feel anything. Does that mean anything? Am I going to die alone and jaded? God, I hope not.  I'm sure everyone thinks at some point how they'd like to die. I know I do. I read somewhere of this 87 year-old who died while dancing. I think I'd like that. Just going along, without a care in the world, then just letting go. I know for a fact that I don't want to drown, burn to death, or die slowly in any way. Like cancer. Cancer would suck.    Anyway, I just thought I 'd share this with you all in the hopes that I'll find out what it means sooner or later.     Talk to you later! *hugs!*

I'm going to redo my room, but I'm caught between two themes, so I thought I'd ask you all. I was thinking of either doing an English gentleman's library (the type where the guy goes on safari and brings all these cool things back) or a vintage, jazzy, black and white NYC theme. Any preferences? Just to help you out, here's what I have in my room:       2 Drexel dark mahogany sleigh beds,       2 dressers, one with a mirror, one in a "highboy" fashion,       1 desk, with all my assorted computer stuff on it,        2 white bookcases (i can replace these),       1 nightstand (matches the beds).        and 1 mahogany drum table (this can leave if necessary)       My carpet is a neutral, so that won't affect anything, and I have stained wodwork, which goes with both themes. All my accessories can be changed in a heartbeat, so don't let that stop you either. I hope to hear from you soon!        

I've determined that my Uncle Andy would be the PERFECT James Bond villain. He's practically a European, he loves fine food, he's a wine expert, he has EXTREMELY expensive taste in things like cars, houses and furniture, and he has this great social laugh/chuckle thing. Oh, and my cousin Alan (the one you're all going to meet) thinks so too. So there!           Muahahaha, I love my family....... *gag*

Leslie's pool party was so much fun! I had a really great time. Ricky and I sang the "I'll fuck you up" song (All State joke), and Leslie kept chucking hot dogs at everyone. After all the oudoor fun, we went inside and watched the most pathetic-yet-funny show I've ever seen. HOORAY FOR POOL PARTIES!

This is Hero to Sexkitten.  I repeat. Hero to Sexkitten. Do you copy, Sexkitten?!

I forgot to mention the job (!) that I got.  my organist called me 2 days ago and asked if I was free on August 10th. I said yes. Then she goes on this whole thing about how apparently this really influential and extremely wealthy woman called her up and asked if she knew any really good singers, and she recommended me. Then this woman told her that she's having a remembrance ceremony for her brother, who at 47 committed suicide. So my organist called me to give me a heads up forthis lady. I had never heard er name before, but the organist (who goes by the name Mrs. Goss) who has lived here for 50 years said that she's loaded and extremely powerful in NH and Massachusetts, and a HUGE patron of the arts. So i'm like  whoa  and wait by the phone. Sure enough, this woman calls and introduces herself and describes the situation that I had already learned from Mrs. Goss. Apparently she just wants someone to sing backgrond music while she has a reverend read a few psalms and whatnot and then follow her acros the road from her HUGE Rye mansion to the ocean while she scatters his ashes. She told me it would only be like 4 songs. Then she asked me, " Your fee is $100, correct?" She was indeed correct. ( Lemme give you a run down. The standard fee is 100, but the standard tip is 25) She said in reply, "I'm sure that could easily be arranged." (NOTE: Mrs. Goss told me after that the rich lady wold DOUBLE my pay if I did a good job!)       So basically on August 10th I'll sing 4 5-minute songs and get paid at LEAST $100. Does that rock or what? Share in my joy, people! The best part is I already know exaclty what I'm going to do with that money: put it in my checking account! After that I'll be all set for another SERIOUS day of shopping! Anyone interested?       

Ohhh yeah. I'm officially like, really cool.               But not as cool as some people.           LIKE DONNIE FLYNN!

Today was fun.  I hung out by a pool and got a nice tan (YES!)  Then I came home and ended up going to the beach and seeing the fireworks with some friends of the family.  It's rather amazing how many people we've met since we moved here. (I make it sound like it was only yesterday, even though it's been over eight years. It's weird because I can still remember Clifton Park perfectly. What's wrong with me?)       Anyway, getting back on topic, the fireworks were mediocre at best. Big surprise there. I actually was more entertained by the form of the smoke as the wind blew it inland. The one time I didn't have my phone, dammit.       Oh, and has everybody seen the Bush/Kerry animation clip at   jibjab.com  ? I heard about it on the news, and went to go watch it. I found it to be quite funny. I mean, I personally strongly dislike both of them and have no draw to politics whatsoever, but I thought the two candidates pulling each other apart to be pretty humorous. If you haven't seen it, i suggest you check it out.        I just remembered: Tomorrow is my friend's pool party. I'm excited. Hope to see you all there! ;^p    (I'm sorry my entries are so random.)   So yeah, I really can't think of anything to write about right now. My parents have  Top Gun  on TV in the room over the garage, and they just played the Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost that lovin' Feelin'" so now I'm finding myself paying less and less attention to my typing and more and more to the song that is now continuing in my head. Curse this musicality of mine!       I bid you all adieu. *hugs*

OK, I officially        Goodnight to you all! *hugs*

Well hello there everybody! um... I don't really know what to type. This is my first blog on this site obviously, so I hope to update often.       I guess I'll just talk about my day, because yes, I'm just  that  cool.       Today I decided to sleep in. I've been getting up at 8 every day, and I guess I just didn't feel like it, so I ended up waking up at 11:30. my mom was just about ready to order out Chinese for lunch, and she asked me if I wanted anything before she left. I was like,  Whoa, she's actually ordering out!  and quickly put in my order. I wasn't very hungry, as I had just woken up, so I snacked on it throughout the day. Chinese food is my life, except for the fact that 2 hours later you're ready to eat again, hahaha.     ANYWAY, then I went to the oral surgeon's office to schedule my next procedure (August 12th, people) So I'll be out of commission for a couple days after it's all said and done. I'm really not looking forward to it, but whatever. The guy was actually pretty cool, and he kept saying how with the drugs I won't remember anything, which actually after a while got a bit unsettling. I was glad that he wasn't all quiet, boring,antisocial, and dry as normal doctors normally tend to be.       So when I got back I hung out with Krystal and ran errands for my mom downtown. On the way back we got caught in a freak rainstorm. It felt really good to just not care about staying dry or anything. That's one thing I love about summer. The rain actually turned out to be a thunderstorm, so Krystal and I were even happier, because we both absolutely love thunderstorms.       Now I'm sitting here, realizing that I've run out of things to say. Peut etre it's a good time to stop typing. Peut etre...       Oh well, I'll guess I'll talk to you later guys! *hugs*

All of a sudden I feel extremely dizzy and thoroughly exhausted. Just thought you'd like to know. ( All I do is GIVE!)

Swelling is bad. Vicodin=good. Thank God I'm actually feeling normal again!      I miss you all. We have to hang out before I go to Florida and then have to come back and do all my summer hw!      *hugs!*

I took my brothers to Marston to hang out on the playground today, and on the qway back they asked to stop at Marelli's. While I waited for them, who should walk up to me but Angela DiMillo! Holy George Washington Christ, I haven't seen her in 2 years! We talked, uch to the annoyance of my brothers, for a good solid hour, and she told me that we have to hang out this week, she's supposed to call me this afternoon. HOORAY FOR SINGING PARTNER REUNIONS!      ...That is all...

Thursday =  ewwwwwwwww. Call me crazy, but I don't think knives go very well on me at all.

*Happiness* I'm going to Florida!  That's all for now. Talk to you later! *hugs*

I'm back!  OMG Clifton Park and Fall River was SOOOOOOO much fun! I got soooooooooo many new clothes! HOORAY FOR HOT CLOTHES! *ahem*  I have to go pick up  my brothers today. Grrrrrrrr. I wish i could leave them up in Manchester in the woods. Oh well...   *GASP* I found the most incredible house EVER in Clifton Park. I want it. Put it in a box right now and send it to me. This thing is HUGE!!!!! I have a picture on my phone. WANT WANT WANT! I saw it when Jeanette and Dean showed us all the new neighborhods tha are springing up in town. These things are HUGE! Each neighborhood is the size of Portsmouth. It's crazy. I mean, what the Hell is there in upstate New York that draws people!? The world is a screwy place...   So yeah, I'm off to Manchester. I haven't seen my brothers in a week, and I've really gotten used to peace and quiet. Pray for me ( if you do that sort of thing...)   Talk to you later! *HUGS!*

Home state-ward bound! I'll be back in a few days. Heads up to Clifton Park! Donnie's back! ;^p         I Love being a New Yorker :)   Talk to you when I get back! *hugs*

So.   Today.   Hm.   Well....   Was awoken at 9:00 sharp. Told I had a half hour to get up and get ready. Ready you may ask? Well, your answer will have to wait. I'm not there yet. So. 9:05 rolls around. I'm too cozy. 9:15. I'll only take a few minutes to get ready. 9:18. There's still plenty of time. 9:20. Fuck, I really should get up. So quick as a bunny on cocaine, I groggily (got to love the disagreeing adjectives!) made my way to get dressed. Down stairs I go, expecting to be hauled out to my dads "workshop" [corner of a storage space facility] to lift heavy things, I realize he's left. (by the way, that was what I had to get ready for.. if your aforementioned question was still anxiously awaiting an answer) Needless to say, I wasted very little time going back to my air-conditioned room to read, happily.   10:30 rolls around. NOW it's time to go haul around heavy things. Ugh.   Blahblahblah   We go down toll farm rd (Is that the right road?) make it to the storage space and I am put to work. And by put to work, I obviously entail standing around while my dad mumbles to himself trying to figure out what needs to get done first, or rather, what I'm capable of helping with). After much standing around, in a moderately cool warehouse might I add, I'm handed an electric drill. Hah! Drilling!    Through much painstaking aggravation I succeeded in taking apart a shoddy workbench/table/ thing  my dad had installed. Aggravation? Yes. Who installs screw SIDEWAYS into the least accessible corner of workbench?! ...   Anyways. After drilling for a period of time... the bit fell out. For no reason. So I had to struggle, with what little drill knowledge I have, in reinserting and maneuvering the drill bit into workable condition. I am not meant to handle wood and tools.    LATER    After a trip or two back and forth from the house and warehouse (Ooo! I forgot to mention! I got to dust off lights! ... Carbon dust is disgusting to deal with on a humid day.) my dad decided to rig up his big-expensive-what-the-hell-does-it-actually-do-?! machine with many red straps. Once done, he decides to borrow the fork lift at the warehouse. With a lot of vrooot-beep-beeep-beep-beep-rrrrraaaaa-vrrroot-vroot-vrooot he maneuvered over to the machine... followed by more fork-lift noises and we had it to the infamous  loading dock!  That's when things got worrisome. Putting the straps to the test. [Ahem. Because the dock is so high, and my dads truck rather far below it, it was only logical that he lift the several thousand pound machine up by the little red straps and place it in the truck.] Aside from the straps stretching about 2 and a half feet when trying to lift the machine of doom, nothing exciting happened. *sigh*   After that there was just much more lifting, grunting, pulling, shoving, strapping and unstrapping to be had once we got the thing back home... with no forklift to help anymore.   Then I spent my day looking at stuff in JoAnn Fabrics. [I've begun constructing a mahvelous orange corduroy bag. i've got a new thing for  orange.  It's weird.] So there's that. My mom and I proceeded over to WalMart thereafter and found a guy in the most (intriguingly) revolting shirt ever. Perhaps some of you have seen Chris Giorgio's highlighter yellow shirt? This was highlighter orange... It must have had battery packs to shine as brightly as it did. GOD. It was a sight to see, I suppose. And what made it worse (two things, really) was the fact that the man wearing it was in his 60's, and the shirt had those tacky fake-wood buttons on it. Not good combinations, let me tell you.       People need to be less uptight about porn and sex.   My labelmaker is the man. Anyone want labels?    Playing spit over a low coffee table results in poor back conditions.   Sprite Remix: BerryClear is the essence of skittles.   I want to go to Boston. I want to visit Kristina.   I want to go to AZ (sooner). I want to visit Chad (longer).   My travel toothbrush..was dusty.. even though it was in a plastic case.   Next week will be boring.   I am going to buy presents. For a certain someone. (Wink) So secretive!   I'm liking purple less and less by the day.   I need  real  chocolate. Not pansy commercial franchise chocolate.   I am  so  demanding.        

Here it is...almost 3 in the morning...my time.  And I'm awake...almost six your time. Le sigh I have found my new love in Sweeney Todd.  I need to get more than just the highlights cd.      ****************************************************** Now it's 3:02...I don't know why I'm still up.

Bon jour, mes amis.    Finalmente yo puedo...postar cosas en este blog.  (I'm assuming the noun blog is masculine) Por eso no necesitan Uds. preocuparse porque yo estoy aqui.  Yay!!  Okay, nough Spanish.  (I know it's often "nuff" but it really should be nough, seeing as how the "word" is "enough" minus the "e.")   Does anybody else find it kinda rediculous when guys sing in falcetto?  Like...on cd's and stuff.    K...I'm gone 4 now!       Live well and love lots!

I say no, nay, never! *clap-clap-clap-clap* No, nay, never, no more! *clap-clap* Shall I play wild rover! *clap* No nay, never, no more!       Medieval Manor last night was wonderful.   The peasant man, Squint, was attractive. He reminded me of Jay Buckley. Coincidentally, Maggie turns to me and says "He looks like your type!".... Moments later "Who's my type?? I have ears like a hawk!", followed by me laughing and blushing profusely.   Twas funnier this go around. The crowd got more into it.       A six course meal is just too much, really.       This time I got a doggie bag to go. The bag had dogs on it, and a printed song. Haha.   Let's all go there when we're 21!        I'll fix this up later, I'm out to look for fabric and patterns for a skirt... G'day to you all.

Oh be-still my beating heart!   He  called me  by phone at 11:30!    He never calls!     EVER!    My life is complete now.       And why is it that the later hours of the evening bring out energy?        Tonight at dinner:       Dad: "Remember when I bought you that bird wing?"   Myself: [over a mouthful of corn] "Mmph."      Dad: "Do you know where that is?"              [upon leaving the table I saunter up to my room, find the owl wing, and place it on my dad's desk]      Dad: "I walked into my office and thought there was a dead rat on my desk!"   Myself: [smirk]       Alright.   It was amusing for  me .       I was just going to type out an irish-style song I made up in my mind about being perky and happy... but then realized you'd never get the jist.       I have a  very  large bug trying to fly around my desk lamp. In what manner will I take care of this matter? Get my dad to swat it to death. Huzzah!

Another tedious day.   Type, pause, read, repeat.       Quite simply this has been the wettest summer to my memory. It really is very depressing, and I'm not even a summer person.       I feel so out of sorts. I stayed up until 3 o'clock last night. ( When was the last time  that  happened? ) Then, to my utter suprise and dismay, awoke at 10:30. My body refuses to let me sleep regardless of my mind repeating over and over "There's nothing to do in this house!". So I continue to alternate between transcribing, reading, and staring at my pleasant beeswax candle.       I'm beginning to dislike how boredom brings greater expectations for a new day. Then that day arrives, and somehow, hopes aren't accounted for, and your mood is left indistinguishable from the pensive thoughts of the day before.       So my hopes are sitting in the back of my mind, creeping up whenever I stop to sit and wonder what there is to do next. Time works in odd ways.. sometimes too lethargic, sometimes too hasty.  Too eager for the future and dreading the shadowy implications of it all, while in the meantime I sit and write entries about the present being unsatisfactory. Impossible to please-- Yes, yes I am.   

Another uneventful day. How grand! What better way to celebrate the passion of boredom than to create a blog? You tell me.       I've sat in this chair for the better part of the day, aside from a brief and fleeting trip to the supermarket to buy light cream ( How can one live without the proper accoutrements for coffee? ) and a bottle of lotion ( Burt's Bees; Milk and Honey. Absolutely divine ).        Also, I cleaned my room. And by clean, I mean straightened up. Things shifted from one shelf to a drawer, and from desk to box. Orderly looking on the outside, but really only hidden piles of junk. Not to say that all my junk is stowed away, but at least now it's... slightly better.       Tomorrow looks to be as interesting as today.       I would highly recommend the book  The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit  by Storm Constantine, but I'm only a short way into it. So far it proves to be excellent reading, though.       I wish I had more to say for a first post.. Oh well, I suppose.       Thank you and goodnight.

This just came to me: You know how your parents always make a big deal about the first word you ever said? Could a person's first word have any effect on the type of person they turn out to be? I wonder...    I know for a fact that my first word was "shit." No joke.  What was your first word? Let's compare!

Billy Joel's "Zanzibar" is the perfect song to get one motivated on a cool July day. That and looking forward to New York ;^p            The inning isn't over yet for me...          Talk to you all later! *hugs*

Why do I constantly feel let down?   Are my expectations too high?   Or have you never been as perfect as my mind portrayed you?       The streets are uneven and my eyes won't raise.       Why are the meanings to actions never interpreted correctly?       Why don't questions have answers?       One of those days... (weeks? months?) where nothing is sufficient and everything only seems to get worse.   Every day spent leaning towards the next.   Is one solid hope worth more than a carload of certainties?   Tonight I'd beg to differ.       Nothing is sustainable    I'm only delaying inevitability.       Why is it we only miss the past?   [why can't heartfelt kisses make another person open their eyes]   I wish I could move my eyes elsewhere

Well kids, let you be the first to hear,      Jordan and I are no longer a couple. Again.         Being worthless isn't so bad, right?

I was pleasently surprised to find out that the service that I had to sing at today was only 30 minutes, but I still got paid 100. This has added to my happiness level. YES!      Anyway, it's been a while since I last typed something here. Just letting you all know I'm alive.  I know you're all disappointed, sorry ;^p.      Psyched for Florida!         Anyways, I've got to go. I'll talk to you all later.

Aren't we just the talkative group.         Schedule has been flip flopped.. changed around.. I finally have to start worrying about college.      It's funny how things catch you off gaurd. The things you've expected the most. I wish this were as easy for me.      And of course.. Senior Pictures...       I wish this were easier.    But then again, I wish for a lot of things.      If only I weren't just being shrugged off...
