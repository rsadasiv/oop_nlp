At first this morning I woke up and wondered who the hell put egg shells all over my apartment and why exactly I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m expected to walk on them.  And then I remember, I got myself in this mess.  Well, kinda.  And I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not really sure yet it if is a mess, but things were certainly tense.  I got up and Jamie wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t in bed.  She was actually sitting on the couch and watching television, which meant that I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t go and play Madden in my shorts like I could when I was a bachelor, you know, two weeks ago.  She wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really watching TV either, she was just sorta sitting there with it running and staring off into space.  She still looked upset, and it was too early for me to try and deal with something like that.  So I went for a run.  I guess that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the one good thing about having a female in the house, it gives me plenty of reasons to get out and go for a run.  She seems to like it when I run, because she was there in the bathroom when I got out of the shower.  Go Shemp! We pretty much avoided talking about the things that happened yesterday, and I completely avoided anything that might have happened over a few beers that I might have had when I was at work, with someone I might work with.  I should go into politics.  But, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Friday, and so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m off to work in a little while.  Things should be pretty lively tonight, the weekend crowd is definitely more interesting than the usuals.  Watching people get drunk is kinda like amusing in it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own way.  I think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to get Jamie out of here tomorrow, go out and see a movie or something.

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s late, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not ready for any drama yet.  I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t gone into the bedroom where I can hear Jamie walking around.  But‚Ä¶things sorta happened tonight at the bar.  Things with Stacy.  Okay, Jamie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in bed now and nearly asleep.  I knew I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be able to sleep without getting this off my chest.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to toss and turn when you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got someone‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s arm and most likely bare leg draped across you.  So what is it that would keep me tossing and turning?  Well, for one, what Jamie said happened with Rob.  They met up, she gave him his things, which was a couple of sweat shirts from college and 3 CDs.  Which you know that means, he just wanted to see her again.  And he was moping and depressed, and he told her that he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t sorry for falling in love with her, and that he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ready to fall back out of love, and the only thing that he was sorry about was coming to Portland to see me.  Hearing this, of course, pissed me the hell off.  How about being sorry for getting totally drunk, hey Rob?  How about being sorry for being an idiot and trying to drive drunk?  How about that one, Rob?  Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good one, how about being sorry for grabbing her, or throwing a punch at me?  Those seem like pretty fucking good things to be sorry about.             Yeah, and the other thing, the Stacy thing.  So, I show up at work, and Stacy and this guy Tom are the only two people working.  It was ungodly slow, and so Stacy and I ended up sitting at a table and just sorta chatting over a couple of beers ‚Ä" Full Sale Pales if anyone is interested ‚Ä" and she could sorta sense that I was pissed about something.  The really weird thing is that when I got up the courage to bite the bullet and come back here, I stood up to leave, and Stacy stood up too, and there was that Hollywood sense of awkwardness between us.  And I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know why, but I leant in and kissed her.  And then I turned and left.  Why did I do it?  The hell if I know.  But I did.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never kissed her before, and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve gone through our flirting phases for a year now.  But, I kissed her and walked back here.              Now that that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s off my chest, I think I can go to bed now.

Today had too much drama.  Or more than I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m used to, however you want to look at it.  I was asleep when things started to happen, meaning the phone ringing didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wake me up.  When I did wake up, Jamie was sitting on the foot of the bed, arguing with someone on the phone.  She got off and man, did she look pissed, she was visibly shaking.  Turns out that she kept some of Rob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s stuff, and he found out about it, and he wanted it back.  She said she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know if she had it, and that if she did, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d mail it to him.  Well, that wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t what he wanted to hear, he wanted her to give it to him personally.  I, personally didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see any problem with that, and me not seeing anything wrong only made her more mad.  Hey! I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m an innocent in this one.  But, not really, not according to Jamie, because she thought I wanted her to come up as soon as possible and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d packed in a hurry, and come up.  And now she had to deal with Rob, again.  I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see how that was a big deal. I mean, we all run into Exes at one point or another, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just the way life works.  She started crying and claiming it was too soon to see him, and I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand because she really loved him, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d left him for me.  And he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d said that, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d denied it to him.  Well, why the hell was she telling me this?  It got me mad.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to be the problem, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to be the blame.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m nobody‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s scapegoat.  She kept crying and I told her to just see him, or to mail them to him and tell him after the package was already gone.  She said she couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be that cold.  Of course, this only made me more pissed.  So, I rolled back over to go back to sleep, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause it was like 11, and she said she was sorry, and she shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be blaming this on me.  I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what she wanted me to say, but she curled up with me and kept crying.  She wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t there when I woke up.  She was actually here, on my computer, looking up the news.  Apparently she does that every day just to see if her brother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been hurt or killed.  He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got email over there, and so they mail back and forth.  She was more calm, but she still looked ready to cry.  Turns out Rob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming up tonight.  Talk about timing.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s my day off, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>work‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> anyway.

So, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve known Jamie for what, a week and a half now, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been living with me for nearly a week, and when you put it down like that it seems like things are moving really fast.  And if they are, why does it seem like these last few days have lasted forever?  I mean, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m awake longer than I was before, before Jamie, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already gone and created a large spot in my life.  But we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re still getting to know each other, which is good too.  We had a fun time at the beach, swapping tales, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d tell her about the beach in Bandon, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d tell me about the beaches in California.  And we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d laugh.  We had ice cream.  It wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t as romantic as on TV or in movies, but it was nice.  She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been calling around to recruiters in Portland during the day, looking at how to get into the FBI.  I think that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s picked.  And she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been telling me about her brother, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in Iraq right with the Army.  He seems like a really cool guy, not at all like I thought a soldier would be.  But then, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really know any.  Anyway, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m exhausted and Jamie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll end up waking me up in a few hours.

So it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s late Saturday night, this getting used to having a girl in the apartment thing isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t as easy at TV makes it out to be.  For one, she gets up way to early.  Other than the first few hours after midnight I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know that there were hours before noon, let alone did I see them.  But she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s looking for a job, or recovering from one, or for some reason she gets up in the morning.  I personally don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand it, but then the morning just isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a part of my life.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s only been two days so far, and she seems a lot less fragile now, no more trembling lip near tear crying spells threatening like when she first got here, or when we were on the phone.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not that bad though, not really, not compared to waking up alone.  It was easier to sleep with her in the bed last night.  I was probably just nervous the first time, that first night.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve actually got things planned for tomorrow.  I figure maybe we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll go out to Cannon Beach, just for the day, since she has a car and everything.  I guess her being here opens up more options than I realized I had.   Anyway, if we go to the beach I can show here the rock, the big one in the ocean, from Goonies.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s real, third largest monolith in the world.  Goonies.  I know.  I have no shame.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a dork.  But I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to go wake Jamie up, revenge for her waking me up this morning, or I guess technically yesterday morning.  Whatever.

Dear lord, today was one of those days.  And I know I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to have to write about it, because I have to confess this to someone, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not a Catholic and a priest wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hear this anyway.  I have to do this here because my apartment is quiet and Jamie doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m back from work yet, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s asleep in my bed.  She showed up early, Friday instead of Saturday and before noon.  Early like 9 am early.  And she came prepared for a long haul.  She came to move in.  I know I might have brought this upon myself,  we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been talking on a the phone a lot, and half the time I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what I was saying because I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d run out of things to say and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been looking for a way to start her future, and perhaps I did, perhaps I offered her space in my apartment.  But, seeing her there on my doorstep, outside my apartment door with a large suitcase and her saying she had more in her car, it was a shock.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never lived with a girl before, not like this anyway.  But, so far it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been good.  We spent the day alternating between sex and unpacking.  We had a quiet dinner in and then more sex for desert.  I know, it seems great, and really it is.  She certainly gives it her all, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s this passion there, and having passion in my life is strange because it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a string of one night stands for so long now.

I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve ever spent as much time on the phone as I did the last few days.  I spent hours on the phone with Jamie yesterday, getting off when my phone started to die.  What on Earth did we talk about?  Yeah, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been asking myself that same question.  We did the dreams and hopes and aspirations thing, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s looking for a job in the government, something to put her polysci degree to use in.  The cool thing is that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s looking at the FBI or something else in Homeland Security.  I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe we even talked after I got off work.  And this could have been a one night stand.  Looks like that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s gone out the window.  She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming up this weekend, so I know I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to get some ass.  Kinda takes the pressure off of tonight, going out with Luke for drinks and whatever.

I woke up to a text message this morning.  It said ‚ÄoeI miss you‚Äù which kinda caught me off guard, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause the only person that texts me is Luke.  And Luke had better not miss me.  It was Jamie.  I called her ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause truth be told, I missed her too.  Or maybe I just missed having her around, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause last night Stacy made a pass at me.  Stacy and I have been on and off for a while now, the problem being she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s off when I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m on and vice versa.  It would have made me feel a lot better if I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t turned her down and Jamie was here.  Instead, I turned her down and came home to an empty bed.  Why does this always seem to happen to me?

Just a quick post before work.  Jamie called around noon today.  I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even mind being it being so damn early.  She got back to Bandon alright, but Rob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s being a total bitch about losing her.  I guess he shoulda thought about that sooner.  Well, fuck him.  Anyway, she was almost in tears, and she kept asking me over and over what we were going to do.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not used to being a we.  Anyway, off to work I go.  I do miss her though.  Maybe being a we isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t so bad.

Jamie just left, she just walked out to the door, but she made it clear that she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to be going.  I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help it, we connected.  This things just sorta happen, I guess.  After I posted this morning I went back to bed, I was up way to early, and after sleeping like hell, I frankly was ready for some rest.  I got up when she got up, it was sometime around eleven.  Still early for me, but what the hell.  So we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re sitting there and having coffee when my phone rings.  It was Rob, cue dramatic music.  So, he sounded like hell, and he was pensive.  Really pensive.  He almost apologized for last night, but I think he was still angry, hell, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be too, but then, I wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t put myself in that position.  And he knew he had to come by, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have his car keys.  Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s where things get difficult.  Jamie didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what to do, she said she was at an impasse, her word, not mine.  That and her things, most of them, were still in Bandon, at Rob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s folks‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> house.  So, she had to leave with him.  She didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what she wanted to do, well, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know what she was going to do.  She made it clear that she felt something between us, a weird way to say that I was better than, well, more than just a lay, and that, well, between me and Rob, I was the winner and he was the walker.  They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d only been dating likes seven months, maybe a little more, but less than a year, and well, I hadn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen the guy in like six or seven years myself ‚Ä" we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d been friends in high school, but that was a long time ago and‚Ä¶ I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m making excuses.  So, Rob shows up and he looks like he spent the night sleeping in an alley, maybe he stayed right there next to his car, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, maybe he got picked up by the cops.  His face was a bit bruised up, and the bags under his eyes didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help.  But, he said he was leaving, going back to Bandon, and Jamie spoke up, asked him to wait, told him something, I dunno, I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear, and I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to pry.  I felt like quoting lines from The Gambler from Kenny Rogers, because that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about the most cheery sunshiny advice I could think of for this kind of situation, if this counts as a situation, do these things happen often? To other people?  Anyway, long story short, they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stick around for long, leaving Portland sometime around two, and she left me with her cell number, and she got mine.  And I feel like a total ass for saying this, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m kinda glad things worked out like this.  I mean, maybe it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been in a relationship for a while, but I miss her, miss her already.  And I have no idea where she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s going, or how we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to make this work, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s kinda like high school right?  I feel like I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m charging head first into a situation where the whole world is telling me to just walk away.  Fuck.

I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe I left her in bed to write this.  Yeah, so last night, around ten thirty, Rob and Jamie show up at my bar.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m thinking that everything was cool, you know, get to show them my side of Portland, hook them up with some microbrews.  Well, turns out that Rob already had a couple of drinks in him before coming into the bar, and well, he got pretty fuckin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> drunk.  And he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not the best drunk, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not even a good drunk.  He started to cause a scene, and Mike the Manager was getting ready to toss him out.  Jamie gave me this look, this total ‚Äoehelp me‚Äù thing and I told Mike that the guy was a friend of mine and they were in town visiting.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d get him outta there.  Mike said ‚ÄoeFine‚Äù but he was taking me off the clock, which isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t normally as cool as he is, but at the moment, it was cool enough.  So, the three of us cut out of there and we walk, Rob stumbles, back to my apartment.  That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when things start to get hairy.  Rob reaches for his car door.  Now, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not the chivalrous kinda guy, but I wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to let him drive hammered.  I told him to give Jamie the keys.  Rob got pissy with me, told me he wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t going to let her drive his car.  I made a reach for the keys and in a moment of drunken brilliance, Rob took a swing at me.  He missed, which was pretty good, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see it coming.  But I did shove him, and he stumbled into his car.  This made him that much more mad.  And he screamed at me, something about he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe I hit him.  Funny right?  Yeah‚Ä¶ So he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s standing there on the side of the street, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s already after midnight, and I start to pull Jamie into the building, hoping that Rob‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll follow.  Well, he doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t, he just gets more mad, and he makes a grab for her wrist.  He yells about how he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pay for a hotel for nothing, and they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re leaving and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming with him.  She took the whole thing pretty well, calmly prying his hand from her wrist one finger at a time, and then he made a grab for her hair.  I stepped in then, and I put myself between him and her, by put myself in between I mean I punched Rob in the face and stood in between him and her after he tripped backwards and fell down.  I told her to go up stairs and I shut the door behind me.  She was a mess.  After it all, she just started crying.  I told her she could sleep in the bed and we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d sort everything out in the morning.  She said she was worried about him driving drunk and getting in a wreck, and when I pulled his keys outta my pocket she could only offer up a weak smile.  I told her to take the bed, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d sleep on the couch, and at first that was cool with her.  But, while I lay there not able to sleep and with those slight shakes and weak knees from, I guess, the adrenaline wearing off, I heard someone walking around my apartment.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tiny, these things are hard to miss.  She called my name, asked if I was asleep.  I told her no.  She asked if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d come to bed with her, she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to sleep alone.  Score, right?  Yeah, right.  So, I get up and go to bed, and it would have been great, except that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d stripped down to just her underwear, and she was like twenty three, and something about that age, the girls only seem to own thongs, or maybe it was the underwear she was wearing for him because she thought she was going to get some that night, but, she wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t wearing anything else, not even a t-shirt.    So, here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s my predicament, I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t gotten laid in a while, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m laying in bed with this to-die-for brunette, tan, firm, totally cute face, with the sharp little nose and full lips and big brown eyes, and she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nearly naked.  Oh, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d just kicked the crap outta her boyfriend.  These things don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really happen.  Really.  At least, I used to think they didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.  Dear Penthouse‚Ä¶ So I get into bed, and I lay there, and it always takes me a while to fall asleep with someone new in my bed, or the bed, or whatever bed, and she, Jamie, curls up with her back against my side.  And I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m trying really hard not to do anything, and eventually I just fall asleep.  I kept waking up, and she kept being there, and I could smell her hair, and it was the entire world.  And I guess she kept doing the same thing.  Sometime early, before the sun was up, I guess we happened to wake up at the same time, and she looked over, and I looked over, and she whispered something, and I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hear her, so I moved closer, and she leaned up and closed her eyes, and that was it.  It started with kissing, and then her underwear came off, and then mine and before you know, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re having sex.  And here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the terrible thing.  It was really good.  I mean  really  good.  And we finished and she curled up against me and we both went to sleep.  And for all that I know, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s still sleeping, even though it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nearly eight thirty now.  But I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to get back to bed before she notices I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m gone.

I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not really used to waking up and expecting to have to do anything, you know, except go to work.  Well, today wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t one of those days.  Yeah, but oh, it was.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have much time to post this, but believe me, it was interesting to say the least.  So, Rob shows up around two, and he knocks on my apartment door, and I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seen the guy since, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, since we graduated high school I guess.  We were pretty good friends, but I stayed in Oregon to go to school and he went down to Berkley.  But, man, the girl he brought with him was gorgeous.  She was way out his league.  This chic named Jamie.  Well, the three of us split to go grab some lunch, I apologized for not having time, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Saturday and I have to work tonight.  We ate at this place called The Daily, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a nice caf√© not far from where I live, like two blocks.  So they just left the car out front of my building and we walked.  I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help it, and I kept trying to hide it from Rob, but I kept checking his girl out.  And I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help it, but I think I was being charming.  Fuck.  I hope he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t notice.  Off to work.  More on this later.  I swear.

So, Rob called me.  He seemed to know better than to call before two.  That or he just fit me into his schedule, he must be so busy touring little Bandon.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know where you come from, but Bandon has a little less than three thousand people in it.  And so Mom has been keeping track of everyone I graduated with.  And Rob left Oregon to go to school in California, and he was stopping in town for some unannounced reason, and visiting people.  Not something I would do.  But then, he graduated college, and that was something I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do either.  Oh, didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t I mention that already?  Yeah, so I was two years into school and I was quickly on my way to getting an English degree, and on one drunken evening, around beer number fourteen, a buddy asked me what I was going to do after school.  And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when I realized the only thing I could really do with an English degree was teach‚Ä¶ teach English.  I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to be a teacher.  So, I dropped out.  Not right then, I just didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t come back in the fall.  Never showed up for my junior year.  But, Rob apparently didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t hit that wall.  And now he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming up to Portland, tomorrow, and I have to figure out how to show him a good time and still work.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a Saturday night, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big night in my little bar.

So, here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the rule, even if I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t work the night prior, a noon phone call is still too early.  My mother apparently doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know this rule.  I got woken up this morning by the phone ringing, not a nice way to get woken, but I stumbled out of bed and answered the phone anyway.  Mom apologized for waking me, but she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get off the phone.  She wanted to talk.  I felt like I was talking to my damn parole officer.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m an adult now, not on parole from being a kid.   Am I still working at that bar?  Damn right I am.   Am I seeing anyone?  Anyone serious?   No, mom.  Getting married and giving you grandchildren is not the highest priority on my list.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not even a priority.   Your friend Rob is in Bandon right now.  He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s visiting his family.  Why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you ever visit?  He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s got a girl with him too.  They seem pretty serious.  Why don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t you have a girl?   I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sorry, Mom.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m just not attractive enough.   Oh, Rob was asking about you.  He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s coming up to Portland.  I gave him your number.   Gee, thanks Mom, when is he coming?  And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s when she hit me, Rob was going to be here tomorrow.  Way to give me a heads up.   Pissed off and awake I got off the phone as quickly as possible.

I got back from my run nearly fifteen minutes ago, just long enough to get my heart rate down to normal and smoke a cigarette.  I know, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll kill me, and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m trying to quit, but I figure I earned this one.  I just ran my brains out people!  I ran completely around North Park twice, well not completely, I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t cross Burnside, but how far did you run today?  Right, keep talking.  I know, I need to run, but trust me, I do it for completely vain reasons, I am starting to get a little fat.  Not  really  fat, and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s why it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s so vain.  And why am I telling you this anyway?  You don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know me.  You‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not even real. So, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got the night off, why am I not going out?  I mean, I should be, right?  Especially since I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been in a dating dry spell for a while now, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been like four months since I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had anything more than a one night stand.  And I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve had a serious relationship since I was in college.  I should have stuck with discussing my own vanity.  Why am I even doing this?  But, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to go out, I mean, going out starts to be a drag when you work at a bar.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not a club person, and well, the new movies aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really playing anything too demanding right now, which means I can go out and grab coffee by myself (not something to knock until you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve tried it) or I can sit here and drink a few beers and play a little Madden.

I made it all the way until noon today before dragging myself out of bed.  Sounds like I slept late, but we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t close the bar until nearly two last night.  And I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been walking to and from work recently, not a lot of parking where I live, gotta pay for that shit.  I told myself I was going to go jogging today, but so far, I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t.  I just woke up and started playing PS2.  ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>Cause that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what I normally do in the morning.  I eventually sat the controller down and got on here, on the computer.  I think something about last night bothered me, probably something to do with the fucking yuppy crowd we get on the weekdays.  I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t stand them, they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re all in their thirties and they think they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re living in some sorta Cheers episode, only not nearly as witty.  They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re pretty lousy tippers too.  Tomorrow‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Friday though, and I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to deal with them tonight.  Maybe I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll take some girl from the bar home tomorrow.  I could really go for getting laid.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a few weeks.  You know what I think bothers me most about those guys at the bar?  The yuppies?  My father is always getting on my case, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m 25 and he hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t quit yet, about being a success.  Those guys are pretty successful, and what do they do?  They hang out in my bar every night.  Success must be great.

I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even know why I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m doing this.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not an ‚Äoeinternet guy‚Äù, I mean, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not even really a cell phone guy.  I got one, got a computer too, but I got one ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause my buddy bought this high tech, what the fuck was the word he used for it, something nuts like ‚Äoebleeding‚Äù or I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know.  Fuck it.  It doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter anyway. So, I get his old computer, a Sony, far out, right?  Yeah, well Tim, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s his name, he comes over a couple of weeks ago and he sets the thing up, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m hooked up wireless to some other dude‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s apartment.  Only, I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think he knows it.  Whatever, right?  Well, so, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d get on from time to time.  I know my way around the internet, college wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t that long ago, only when I used to get on, Napster was legal, and everyone was sharing files.  Now, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m set up with email, and my computer basically just sits there.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have to do research anymore.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ask chicks for their email.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really know anyone.  Pretty lonely, and I work in a bar, so lonely is not something that I have to do too often.  In fact, the only person that I talk to on this thing is Tim, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s usually when he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s online and drunk and sending me instant messages.  Oh, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not always drunk, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a pretty good excuse for his spelling being so bad.  But, once upon a time I was an English major, so I guess some things just stayed with me.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got to get to work soon, another night pouring beer, but before I really don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to leave my first post unfinished.  So, one of the links that Tim sent me was this thing called a blog.  I mean, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve heard of it, they had some of them covering the DNC this year, but I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ever really care to figure them out.  I mean, like I said, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not an internet guy.  So, I start reading this guy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s blog, the one that Tim sent me, and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s all about his crazy times in London.  It was actually pretty damn interesting.  But not as interesting as this link on the side of the page, it was this random blog link.  I spent a good two hours just clicking blog to blog.  Man, most were crap, and those were the ones in English, and I know I can write a hell of a lot better than that.  But, the final straw came when I found this blog that was seven minutes old.  It was a single paragraph called ‚ÄoeMen Suck‚Äù or ‚ÄoeAll Men Suck‚Äù or something like that.  That was it. So, I figure if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m reading blogs like that, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d better come up with one of my own.  Right.  My name‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Shemp by the way.  Well, not my real name, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s my fake rap name.  Something we came up with closing one night at the bar.  If you were a Rapper, what would your name be?  We were kinda drunk.  I said I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d be Biggy Shemp, ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>cause I got hairy knuckles.  Not overly hairy, but there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hair there.  And it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s just something that sorta stuck.  But, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m off to work now, and no one is gonna read this anyway.
