Crime and libraries‚Ä"two things almost everyone hates. But put them together and you have one of the greatest resources in the history of great resources. Leave it to the brilliant people at Court TV to come up with this genius website.   One of my favorites entries belongs to   Hadden Clark  . The story of this paranoid schizophrenic murderer story involves cross-dressing, moldy sausage, Jesus look-a-likes, the Culinary Institute and barbequed breasts.  You might wonder why nobody seems to notice Hadden's strange behavior sooner. If I were Tom Ridge and Tom Ridge were in charge of containing crazy sexual predator cannibals in early 90s Maryland, I might switch to an Orange alert after hearing about this incident:  "Hadden began by balancing a 10-gallon can of oil on top of a door so that it would spill when the door was pushed open. After spraying black dye on the living room carpet, he hid rotting fish heads inside the family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s piano, chimney, and stove. As a final act of revenge, he killed both the family cats, placing one dead feline on the front door welcome mat and the other inside the refrigerator. Finally he stole several inconsequential items that ranged from books to tools--even the family‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s vacuum cleaner."  Jeez!  Another classic is   Death in a Bottle: the Tylenol Terrorist  .   As comprehensive as the CL is, there are several notable omissions in their annals of deviance‚Ä"most glaring is the absence of Frances Schreuder.  Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite who, upon finding herself disinherited from her father, Franklin Bradshaw‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s will, decided to enlist her 17 year-old son Marc to murder him.  In 1978, after failing to kill Mr. Bradshaw by poisoning his oatmeal, Marc shot gramps in the head.   The best part of this story is the Howard Hughes-ey patriarch:  "The 76-year-old Bradshaw‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s own lifestyle was anything but lavish. Although he reportedly was worth at least $10 million, he was known for being both frugal and eccentric: He drove a rusty pickup, bought his clothes at thrift shops and used an empty Coors carton as a briefcase. After he was killed, a stained $10 bill was found tucked inside his shoe."  But enough with the nitpicking--The Crime Library is a true American masterwork.

Paul Bremer: "I'm a rich, whiny, penisless baby."

Perhaps the most terrifying thing about an otherwise very terrifying Arnold Schwarzenegger presidency is the prospect of seeing Maria Shriver‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hideous demon face endlessly for four to eight years.  While she may be a Kennedy, a Democrat, a spokesperson for the mentally retarded, a journalist and acclaimed author of the book, "What's Heaven?‚Äù, her face is inexcusable. At least Skeletor has "a great ass," as her future husband charmingly phrased it to Maria‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s mother upon their first meeting.   Ever since Arnie toppled the cuddly Gray Davis in last fall‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s total recall, talk of a President Schwarzenegger has been rampant. Last fall, singer-songwriter-Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) even introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow foreign born, naturalized citizens to be eligible for the presidency.   Hatch thinks his buddy, Austrian-born Arnold "Eating is NAHT Cheating" Schwarzenegger would make an excellent president despite his rapist tendencies. Of Schwarzenegger‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s indiscretions, Hatch said last year, "We have to look at people who they are today, not what they may have done wrong in the past."  I wonder if this guy knows some other Senator named Orrin something who, from his perch as Judiciary chairman, led the impeachment drive against Bill Clinton and declared Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s past behavior "immoral and wrong" in 1999.   Regardless of your feelings towards Arnie, Orrin or Bill, the American people do not deserve to be subjected to this kind of torture. Please write your senator and tell them that if we are going to defile the constitution, it better be over gay marriages.

What wouldn't Zell "Zellout" Miller do for the Republican Party?   It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been announced that this supposed Democrat from Georgia will be a featured speaker at the GOP convention, the same one that's coincidentally taking place in New York just days before the third anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  In 2001, Zell saluted John Kerry as "an authentic" American war hero who had fought to strengthen our military. But now Miller will be Zellously speaking out against Kerry, who, in three short years has apparently transformed into an "out-of-touch ultraliberal from Taxachusetts" whose "foreign and domestic policies would seriously weaken the country."  This isn't the only great performance from Senator Turncoat. Besides endorsing every major Bush policy initiative allowing the President to falsely claim the mantle of bipartisanship, Miller recently invoked "Janet Jackson, Kid Rock, the flag, rap music, the prophet Amos, Arnold Toynbee, and the fallaciousness of separating church and state" on the Senate floor to illustrate the merits of a federal amendment banning gay marriages.   Speaking of stupid amendments, Miller isn't just interested in adding them. Always trying to put the democratic back in undemocratic, Miller urged repeal of the 17th amendment‚Ä"the pesky one that allows for Senators to be popularly elected by voters.  Apparently Zell is nostalgic for the good old days of the 19th century when Senators were appointed by state legislatures.   Hmmm...where would he get such a silly idea? Oh wait, Zell himself was elevated to the Senate by then-Governor Roy Barnes‚Ä"an appointment considered "one of the worst mistakes" of Barnes' term by former President and expert on bad mistakes Jimmy Carter.  Maybe Sen. Miller should just move to Taxachusetts and marry   Ed Koch  .  Other things Zell should get married to:  Curves Mike Bloomberg Coors Courier New Night and weekend service on the L Sam Phillips That Six Flag‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s guy Domino‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Pizza  "A Horse With No Name" Disney    Haymish Fuse   Angelina Jolie Hotmail "American Beauty" Michiko Kakutani

Hurricane James is *proudly* introducing a new feature called "Dykes I Like" where exceptional L Words will be periodically spotlighted.   Out of the 62 women in the House, only one is openly gay. The big dyke is Tammy Baldwin, a three-term Democrat from Wisconsin and by all accounts, she looks great these days. According to those policy wonks at the Advocate, Baldwin's "once fussy hairdo is now softly tousled. Her boxy suits have given way to fashionable separates. In her fitted jacket, tailored slacks, and sleek high heels, she is polished but not slick. With an easy smile and a soft, feminine voice, she betrays not a hint of radicalism in appearance or delivery."  But this Tammy is more than just a pretty face. Her showdown earlier this year with   Rick Santorum  on "Face the Nation" proved Tammy could really kick ass, but that's not to suggest Baldwin's legislative focus is limited to gay issues and courting the polygamist/bestiality vote. The centerpiece of Baldwin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s progressive agenda, buoyed by a coalition of student, labor and minority interests, has always been the establishment of a single-payer, universal health care system.   Congratulations Tammy Baldwin, you're officially a Dyke I Like.

According to this report from the good people at   The Smoking Gun :   While seated on the bench, an Oklahoma judge used a male enhancement pump, shaved and oiled his nether region, and pleasured himself, state officials charged yesterday in a petition to remove the jurist. According to the below complaint filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General, Donald D. Thompson, 57, was caught in the act by a clerk, trial witnesses, and his longtime court reporter (these unsettling first-hand accounts will make you wonder what's going on under other black robes). Visitors to Thompson's Creek County courtroom reported hearing a "swooshing" sound coming from the bench, a noise the court reporter said "sounded like a blood pressure cuff being pumped up." Thompson, the complaint charges, even pumped himself up during an August 2003 murder trial. The AG's petition quotes Thompson (pictured above) as admitting that the pump was "under the bench" during the murder case (and at other times), but he denied using the item, which was supposedly a "gag gift from a friend." ...  All of this makes me feel so fucking jurisprudent.

.  Despite the subway‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s dispatcher‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s repeated apologies for the unavoidable delays, it took three times as long to get to work as usual. To make matters worse, once I got to Union Square, I literally bumped into one of New York‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s most cloying personalities‚Ä"NY1‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s insufferable parenting ‚Äoereporter‚Äù   Shelley Goldberg .   Since murder is still illegal, NY1 should clearly eliminate Shelley‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s inane segments and replace them with more Pat Kiernan, the adorable Canadian cutie who delivers me weather on the 1s every ten minutes and lets me know exactly what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s in the papers. I'm in love with him.

.  Well it seems that Ralph Nader is right about one thing these days‚Ä"that   John Edwards  will make the hottest Vice President ever. Hotter than Dan Quayle even. Ok, he didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t exactly phrase it that way, but he did suggest to presumptive dead person John Kerry that Edwards would be the best choice for VP. Um, duh. Can anyone be hotter than John "sue me now" Edwards? The thought of seeing his cute trial lawyery face and hearing his sweet North Carolina accent for potentially 16 years makes me so excited. And by "excited," I mean "gay."   While we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re on the subject of good advice, here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s some from   Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Mich)  who told Nader yesterday at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting: "Get your ass out."

A California judge ordered the release of the divorce papers of Illinois Republican Senate candidate   Jack Ryan  and his former wife, America‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sweetheart,   Jeri Ryan , the vivacious, lovable superstar beauty of such unforgettable classics as "Star Trek: Voyager," "Matlock: the Final Seduction," and "Boston Public" and the revelations are quite steamy.  It seems the conservative investment banker has a taste for what he calls ‚Äoeavant-garde nightclubs.‚Äù And by ‚Äoeavant-garde,‚Äù Ryan means nightclubs that offer mattressed cubicles, ‚Äoecages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.‚Äù   According to Jeri, her ex ‚Äoewanted me to have sex with him there, with another couple watching, I refused. Respondent asked me to perform a sexual activity upon him, and he specifically asked other people to watch. I was very upset. We left the club and respondent apologized, said that I was right and he would never insist that I go to a club again. He promised it was out of his system."  Way to treat a lady right, Respondent!   "Then during a trip to Paris he took me to a sex club in Paris, without telling me where we were going. I told him I thought it was out of his system. I told him he had promised me we would never go. People were having sex everywhere. I cried, I was physically ill. Respondent became very upset with me, and told me it was not a 'turn-on' for me to cry. I could not get over the incident, and my loss of any attraction to him as a result."  For the sake of fairness, let‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s listen to Ryan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s defense: "What dad wouldn't do the same thing I did?"  Um, good question. But what I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t understand is why these episodes repulse Jeri when she has to look at Fyvush Finkel every day.    .   Regardless of daddy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s avant-garde escapades, this douchebag will be defeated come November if he doesn't end up dropping out of the race sooner.   Barack Obama , Ryan‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s opponent, is top notch‚Ä"truly one of the best Senate candidates the Democrats have fielded in years. Obama (rhymes with Osama) was the first Af-Am editor of the Harvard Law Review, then worked as a community organizer in Chicago, a professor at University of Chicago Law School and now he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a state senator. Obama's appeal is broad and is reflected by commanding leads in every major poll.   In general I think scandals are stupid.  But still, one can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help wanting payback for the way the Republicans degraded the greatest decade in recent memory, the 1990s.

First of all, I just want to say that I love public transportation. And for the States, New York‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s subway system is really as good as it gets. And since New York is the best city in America and America is the best country in the world, that makes this system even better than best. But lately I think I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve reached my breaking point when it comes to dealing with the crazy idiots on my commute.  Here are some subway complaints I would like to lodge publicly about people and things that annoy me.   Hey Jealousy: Why are you giving me dirty looks? Is it my fault you don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have your own Blublockers?  Oh, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re getting off? ME TOO: When we are both clearly getting off at the same stop‚Ä"you, uptight yuppie demon, are sitting and I am standing ‚Ä" and you decide that it makes sense to prematurely dash to the doors, minutes before the train has entered the station, so you can be the first one out. In order to do this, you expect me to release my hand from its grip on the pole or the whatever and go flying across the subway car just so you can be closer to the door. As if your overeager body language and grunts weren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough, try saying ‚ÄoeExcuse Me‚Äù repeatedly and in the bitchiest tone possible to make sure that I notice you. Think of all the times you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve gotten trapped in the subway and missed your destination by waiting patiently for the subway to stop, realize that it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s never, and then go fuck yourself.  Arts and farts and crafts: Oh, hi businessman, thanks for farting right beside me on the 4/5 this morning--what a nice treat! We all love Mickey D‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s breakfast burritos, but try to at least hold in the side-effects until it blends in with the foul air pocket you are bound to encounter only steps from the station.   Iparty: I have an ipod too, but why, Mr. Hipster, do you insist on using the headphones Apple provides you? They are so uncomfortable and the fact that they generate no sound whatsoever is a definite minus. Is it just so you can be identified as an anonymous casualty of the ipod epidemic that swept the L in 2003? Or is it just so I can hate you?  Give a hoot: There is absolutely nothing funny about littering.  Hurry up and wait: Ok! On you mark, get set, go fat lady‚Ä"make sure you race ahead of me to get to the stairs just so you can descend them as slowly as possible. Just for fun, you might want to walk in the middle of the staircase and then periodically shift your obesity to the right and left so that nobody could possibly pass you.   Thank god watching TV and gmailing don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t involve going underground with gross strangers.

More fallout from Whoopigate -- Here is part of an email the President sent me today (The first paragraph IS real):  Dear James,   My opponent has been spending some time with his base as well -- most recently, he attended a gala with his Hollywood friends.  Evidently, things got a little out of hand.  My name came up a few times.  And now the Senator refuses to release a tape of that whole enchanted evening. Could be that his friends, whom he said conveyed the "heart and soul of America," actually embarrassed themselves and the candidate.  On the other hand, my Vice President has been spending some time with our base -- he attended a covert energy policy task force with his Enron friends and other corporate cronies and polluters.  Evidently, things got a little out of hand.  My name came up a few times.  He had a few heart attacks. And now Dick Cheney refuses to release a transcript of that whole enchanted meeting. Could be that his friends actually embarrassed our administration, looted their corporations and sold the country.   Also, his daughter‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a lesbian.  Love, W.

Just when he was putting his life back together, it falls apart again.   Yesterday Rupert Murdoch's   Daily Mirror , the self-proclaimed ‚ÄoeNewspaper of the Year,‚Äù announced that Saddam Hussein, already agonizing a ‚Äoewounded finger,‚Äù appeared to have suffered a minor stroke.  And if that weren't bad enough, today, according to the   Associated Press , Saddam is also battling a chronic prostate infection, but refuses to undergo a biopsy to prove it's not cancer.   Why do bad things happen to good people?

As the successor to Katherine Harris, Florida Secretary of State Glenda Hood had some pretty expensive shoes to fill. And fill them she has--with Republican bullshit.  Glenda Hood  was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to supervise all of Florida‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s elections. And today, the NY Times reports on her performance:  ‚ÄoeAlmost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of touch-screen voting in Miami-Dade County have been lost, stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near. The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, county elections officials said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 gubernatorial primary."  Oops, they did it again!  Hood took the news in stride, declaring that, ‚ÄoeWe are leaps and bounds ahead of where we were in 2000 and we are far ahead of most every other state in the nation.‚Äù What a relief.   In a non-related, but embarrassing note, Glenda Hood‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s property tax payment was over three months late this year, a mistake her spokeswoman blamed on a mortgage lender.  ''I believe it was a mix-up by the mortgage company,'' Hood's spokeswoman, Jenny Nash, told reporters Friday.   I have an idea: Maybe Glenda should just turn black, set up her mortgage on a Florida electronic voting machine and it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll disappear without a trace.

Ooo, he is 'secret admirer' good. He is 'shoe shopping' good. He is Day-At-The-Spa Good, he is Foot Massage Good...NO! Barack Obama is a Weekend With No Boys Good!   Obama for President!

Who will it be?  Update: We have a winner

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s nice to know that Saddam Hussein is not only looking great, but feeling great too. Even though he spends most of his time in solitary confinement, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no slouch. Iraq‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s human rights minister reports that Saddam is keeping busy writing poems about George Bush and enjoying his favorite treats including ‚ÄoeAmerican muffins and cookies.‚Äù  Saddam is also maintaining a garden, exercising sensibly and spending quality time with good friends like Chemical Ali.  Miss Detective wonders ‚Äoehow much the rent would be on this cell if it were in New York?  Painted a clean white, much bigger than my room, plus there's air conditioning, room service, and an outdoor garden--perfect for summer fiestas!"  But one naysayer thinks that Saddam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoeapparent care for his surroundings is ironic when you think he was responsible for one of the biggest ecocides when he drained the southern marshes."  Ecocide, shmicocide, I think Saddam has turned lemons into lemonade.

It turns out the power broker who got Hillary's speaking slot at the Democratic convention is not only sexy, but she's also totally racist.   In newspaper columns written when her husband Tom was a state Senator, Iowa First Lady Christie Vilsack demonstrated a curiosity for other cultures and their unique dialects:  "I am fascinated at the way some African-Americans speak to each other in an English I struggle to understand, then switch to standard English when the situation requires."  But it's not just Af-ams that "fascinate" Christie-this Vilsack is an equal opportunity offender.  Reflecting on a trip to exotic New Jersey, she recalled "Later, on the boardwalk, I heard mothers calling to their children, 'I'll meet yoose here after the movie. The only way I can speak like residents of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania is to let my jaw drop an inch and talk with my lips in an 'O' like a fish. I'd rather learn to speak Polish."  And if you thought New Jersey was bad, the south also has some serious ‚Äoelanguage problems‚Äù:  ‚ÄoeWhen I ask for directions, I can't understand the slurred speech of southern Americans, who are so polite and eager to please."  Mrs. Vilsack became enraged when she was offered a ‚Äoeside saddle" instead of a ‚Äoeside salad‚Äù by a eager-to-please, but nonetheless incoherent West Virginia waitress.   Just when you thought Republicans had cornered the racist market, the Democrats prove once again there is always room for me-tooism.

"Some of my best friends are black...and I love Oprah"

As reported by the always-sensitive NY Post, Showtime will unveil a reality program called "Fat Actress" starring "hefty heifer" Kirstie Alley in the title role. The "comedy" will document "Burstie" Alley's twin struggle with an anorexic career and a bloated body. "Fat Actress" will be co-produced by Brenda Hampton, the mastermind behind television's "7th Heaven."   Can this get any better?

Please shoot me now.

In what surely comes as a huge surprise to most political observers, Dennis Kucinich made an about face and suddenly dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination today sending shock waves (not to mention ripples) throughout Washington.  The big-eared vegan cutie, who would have been a formidable opponent for Bush, has officially endorsed the dark horse Kerry-Edwards ticket, while issuing a polite ‚Äoefuck you‚Äù to Ralph Nader:  "John Kerry can win because there is a place within the Democratic party for everyone, including those who may be thinking of supporting Ralph Nader. Most people know I have many of the same commitments Ralph has. If there is room for me in the party and the Kerry-Edwards campaign, there is certainly room for Ralph and for his supporters."  Exactly. I mean, if there is room in this party for my ass and Matt Damon, there certainly must be room for Ralph and his supporters.

‚ÄoeDemocrat‚Äù Zell Miller calls her ‚Äoeloony, dangerous and irresponsible.‚Äù Her hometown newspaper calls her ‚Äoethe most prominent nut.‚Äù Baby blowhard Jonah Goldberg calls her ‚Äoedumber than rock salt and more repugnant than Yasser Arafat's three-week-old underwear.‚Äù  And thanks to the voters of Georgia's 4th district, we all might be calling her Representative this fall.   She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Cynthia McKinney and isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it great that she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s back?  Why does everyone hate her so much? Well, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, McKinney, a vocal advocate of Palestinian rights, suggested in a radio interview that:  "We know there were numerous warnings of the events to come on September 11thÔøΩ. What did this administration know and when did it know it, about the events of September 11th? Who else knew, and why did they not warn the innocent people of New York who were needlessly murdered? What do they have to hide?"  And then later insanely added:  "I am not aware of any evidence showing that President Bush or members of his administration have personally profited from the attacks of 9-11. A complete investigation might reveal that to be the case."  What a deranged nutcase!  The Washington Post soon ran front page headlines like this: ‚ÄoeDemocrat Implies Sept. 11 Administration Plot.‚Äù And The New York Times‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ÔøΩ Lynette Clemetson came up with this brilliant analysis: ÔøΩ‚ÄùMs. McKinney suggest[ed] that President Bush might have known about the September 11 attacks but did nothing so his supporters could make money in a war.ÔøΩ‚Äù   Following the hysteria of McKinney‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚Äoefiery,‚Äù ‚Äoeparanoid,‚Äù and ‚ÄoeAmerica-hating‚Äù remarks, she was ousted from the House by upstart and Republican puppet   Denise Majette  as a result of crossover voting. But comeback she did. After finishing first in Tuesday's Democratic primary, Cynthia is poised to reclaim her old seat this November.     So Jonah, how does Yasser Arafat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s three-week-old underwear smell now?

After initially refusing to accept signatures collected by Michigan Republicans in order to get on the state‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ballot, Ralph Nader has changed his mind.  Out of their love for democracy and their respect for ‚Äoevoices and choices‚Äù, the Michigan GOP submitted 43,000 signatures to ensure Nader‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s place on the ballot this November as an independent candidate for the presidency. And Nader isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t saying no.  Nader‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s campaign spokesperson Kevin Zeese, in a rare fit of principled judgment said last week ‚Äoethe campaign would refuse the GOP signatures.‚Äù Then he slightly altered his earlier comment, saying ‚Äoehe wasn't sure that was still the case.‚Äù And here is his latest statement: ‚ÄoeYay, thanks Republicans, you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re the best! I love Bush! Kerry bad! Down with unscrupulous Democraps! Bush YAY‚Ä¶La La La, BUSH!‚Äù  If you are going to denounce the Democrats for accepting corporate money, it doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t seem all that credible to let corporate and ultra-conservative institutions underwrite your campaign.  As flameout Howard Dean put it so aptly, when your house is on fire, it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not really the time to rearrange the furniture. So basically, even if the Democrats are kind of crappy, we can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just sit back and watch all of our expensive stuff burn.

Just when you thought Republicans couldn't embarrass us any further...

On Friday, Ohio's Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell prohibited three counties from using Diebold electronic voting machines after tests revealed ‚Äoean unacceptable level of security flaws.‚Äù Blackwell's decision comes months after California decertified many of its Diebold machines.  In case you don't recall, Diebold chairman Walden O'Dell released a statement last year declaring his commitment ‚Äoeto helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes" to President Bush. Not to suggest any impropriety, it just so happens that associates of   Diebold  have generously donated $63,040 in the past four years to political candidates and all but $2,500 has gone to Republicans.   Blackwell's good judgment in this instance might make it a little easier to forgive a few of his prior lapses. Some of which include:  1)	Being a Republican.  2)	Proclaiming gay marriage to be a ‚Äoedirect threat to the future of                       America and its children.‚Äù   3)	 See #1.

This jibjab thing is kind of   funny .

Martha Stewart was sentenced today to a combined ten months in prison and house arrest for lying about a stock sale and   contributing  to Democratic political campaigns.  According to the AP:  "Just before her sentence was pronounced, Stewart asked the judge to 'remember all the good I have done.'  'Today is a shameful today. It's shameful for me, for my family and for my company,' she said."  Shameful indeed.

The Republicans in Illinois sure know how to pick a winner.   Only three years ago, the GOP was a serious force in statewide politics. Now it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a total joke. Since 2002, the Illinois GOP has really done a remarkable job of fielding candidates with either no experience, baggage from sex scandals or both. In order to be considered as a statewide Republican candidate in Illinois, you must:   A) Have absolutely no experience in public office. Coach and self-described ‚Äoeultra-ultra-ultra-ultra conservative‚Äù Mike Ditka recently withdrew his name from contention as a possible Senate candidate following the much discussed departure of Jack Ryan, another contender with zero experience in public office. Many Republicans were disappointed when Ditka removed himself from consideration. Apparently to the Illinois GOP, nothing says compassionate conservatism more than ‚Äoeenthusiastic drinking and gambling,‚Äù a ‚Äoevolcanic temper and support for public executions.‚Äù   B) Have a history of involvement in embarrassing sex scandals. If avant garde sex clubs aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t your thing, maybe inappropriate gay jokes are more up your alley.   Andrea Barthwell , a potential replacement for Jack Ryan, has some baggage of her own. A top official in the White House drug policy office, Barthwell was reprimanded in a memo for ‚Äoelewd and abusive‚Äù behavior towards her staff. According to the memorandum, Barthwell:   ‚Äoemade reference to this staff member sitting on men's laps. A kaleidoscope pointed upward was placed on a chair by Dr. Barthwell as the staff member was about to sit down. Dr. Barthwell suggested that the staff member would want to cut the cake available for the gathering because the knife was ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>long and hard‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> and he might ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>enjoy handling it.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> When the cake was cut, Dr. Barthwell referred to the pieces as 'most' or 'beefy' and she said to the staff member, 'I know you like it big and meaty.‚Äù   The Illinois GOP probably would put the kaleidoscope on the ballot if it were an alcoholic, homophobic, sex-clubbing, football coaching member of the Ryan family, which brings us to our last requirement:   C) Have the last name Ryan. Beleaguered Governor George Ryan decided against running for reelection in 2002 after a bribery scandal in his administration produced 50 convictions. So what does the Illinois GOP do? They nominate Attorney General Jim Ryan. With nearly a quarter of the Illinois electorate believing Jim to be George, the Democrats took hold of the governorship for the first time in 30 years. Having learned nothing from the double Ryan debacle, the Republicans nominated investment banker/swinger Jack Ryan earlier this year only to watch his campaign implode.   Isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t it nice to see another party in total disarray for a change?

So maybe she didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t merit that Oscar for ‚ÄoeGhost,‚Äù and maybe ‚ÄoeHollywood Squares‚Äù wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t the best career choice, and maybe having sex with her is like throwing a hot dog down a hallway, but did Whoopi Goldberg really deserve to be fired for criticizing President Bush?  Slim Fast has dumped Ms. Goldberg after Republicans threatened to boycott their diet products following what the NY Post refers to as ‚ÄoeWhoopi‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s X-Rated Rant‚Äù in which Whoopi compared her pubes to the president at a Democratic fundraiser. According to the always reliable Post, "Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia." Big Whoopi?  Like I'm not doing that exact same thing right now? The Post apparently had no word as to what Vice President Gephardt thought of this m√™l√©e.   Beneath all of their fat, the Republicans are awfully thin-skinned when it comes to this kind of criticism. Bush campaign manager Ken ‚ÄoeAngry Inch‚Äù Mehlman sent me this email yesterday, an open letter to John Kerry calling for the video release of aforementioned fundraiser: ‚ÄoeDo most Americans in their hearts, think that calling the President a "thug" and a "killer" represents the "heart and soul" of our nation?  We don't think so, but we think voters should decide for themselves by watching the celebrities John Kerry said captured the "heart and soul" of America.‚Äù Ken, get a fucking life. Do most ‚ÄoeAmericans in their hearts‚Äù think this is a REAL issue? The fact that this is being discussed at all makes about as much sense as Slim Fast ever hiring Whoopi Goldberg as their spokesperson in the first place.  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t see Ken Mehlman calling on Vice President Dick Cheney to apologize for telling Democratic Senator Pat Leahy to ‚Äoefuck off‚Äù in the Senate chamber for investigating Halliburton. And I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t recall having heard him repudiate McCarthy apologist and ABC election night commentator Ann Coulter for repeatedly calling former president Bill Clinton a rapist and coke-addict and Hillary Clinton a murderer.  Congress, the task is yours; I implore you to impeach Whoopi Goldberg.

So   Hillary Rodham Clinton  will not speak at this year's Democratic National Convention. Is it because of her love for ugly, gay sculpture?  Even this   lady  made the lineup.

"It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife."  -- Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), advocating a constitutional ban on same-"gender" marriage.

On the advice of a devoted Hurricane James reader, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve decided to introduce a new feature‚Ä"Ls From Hell, where repulsive lesbians will be publicly shamed. The first recipient of this dubious honor is a no-brainer, literally: Mary Cheney.  Mary Cheney is the Clarence Thomas of dykes. Her long career of subverting the rights of fellow homos is truly impressive, here is a brief overview:  According to   Salon,  Mary Cheney came out to her parents in her 20s, and "her father seemed to take it better than her mother.   Father and daughter  are known to travel together, enjoying hunting and fishing, but Mary Cheney is said to be less close to her mother." That's funny, I've always thought   Lynne  to be the more cuddly Cheney.  In the 1990s, Mary became quite well known in the Denver ‚Äoequeer-and-beer circles‚Äù for her courageous work as a marketing liaison to gay and lesbian alcoholics for the Coors Brewing Co. In case you didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t know, during this period Coors was desperately trying to overcome a homo boycott of their products following the revelation that its founders‚Ä"including one of this year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s   US Senate candidates ‚Ä"withdrew domestic partnership rights for its employees while simultaneously underwriting a host of ultra-conservative causes.  After receiving an MBA from the University of Colorado, Mary embarked on a new project that would assuredly fuck gays up the ass: the campaign to elect her father,   Dick , (vice) President in 2000. Mary dutifully served as her loving (and lovable) father‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s assistant.  Two years later, Mary helped the Republicans recruit gay voters in the 2002 midterm elections. Currently, Mary‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s official role in Bush-Cheney ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>04 is director of vice-presidential operations.   Always a nepotistic turncoat, never a lesbian bride, Mary is now under increasing   pressure  to make a public stand on the federal gay marriage amendment. She is caught between a rock (mother   Lynne , who is opposed) and a hard place (daddy   Dick , who is suddenly in favor).  So where does all of this leave little Miss Cheney? Probably in Hell where proud Mary will keep on burning.

This is how I feel today. Luckily I'm in Michigan where Kirstie Alley is practically an Olsen twin, so I actually feel quite good about myself. I love Michigan. As the state's slogan proclaims so proudly,   "Yes, Michigan!"

In a development that will undoubtedly interest only me, my boss and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Senate killed the cynically titled ‚ÄoeClass Action Fairness‚Äù bill yesterday. ‚ÄoeTort reform,‚Äù the darling project of Big Business and its allies in the White House and Congress has been a top legislative priority since the selection of Bush in 2000.    In what is shaping up to be a year long on grandstanding and short on accomplishment, the Republican Senate is not up to its job. Instead of actually passing laws‚Ä"with a few noxious exceptions like reinforcing the Patriot Act‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s worst elements ‚Ä"Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is busy using the Senate floor as a platform to humiliate Democrats by exploiting their votes on various controversial issues.    It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no accident that the Class Actions Unfairness bill‚Ä"which would divert Class Action trials out of state courts and into the backlogged (and far more defendant-friendly) federal courts‚Ä"was scheduled for a vote the week John Kerry announced his running mate, *trial lawyer* and all around hottie John Edwards.   Early next week Frist is calling a vote on the Constitutional amendment banning gay marriages. In what must be sheer coincidence, the vote will shortly precede the Democratic convention where John Kerry will accept his party's nomination in his hometown of Boston, GayMarriageachussetts.    Puhleeza Gibbons! It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s time to send these do-nothing-gooders home once and for all.



In an excellent op-ed on the lack of Republican oversight in the Bush era, Rep. Waxman (D-Calif) writes:  "Republicans in the House took more than 140 hours of testimony to investigate whether the Clinton White House misused its holiday card database but less than five hours of testimony regarding how the Bush administration treated Iraqi detainees."  Read the whole thing, it's good.

According to reliable sources at the   New York Post , Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt will be selected as John Kerry‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s running mate. A visibly shocked   Gephardt  could barely contain himself once the Kerry campaign leaked the news.  Most pundits are questioning Gephardt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s readiness for the job. As a lifelong Washington outsider, will this fresh-faced newcomer be able to assume the "awesome" responsibility of the presidency? Or will excitement be all that Gephardt adds to the ticket?  Perhaps Kerry based his decision on Gephardt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s winning track record. As Democratic leader of the House, Gephardt failed to wrest control of the chamber in four successive cycles‚Ä"but he did win his own, heavily Democratic seat 14 times!  And who can rile up the Democratic base more than the co-author of Bush‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Iraq mandate? To top it all off, Gephardt will certainly not carry his home state of Missouri.  Go Kerry-Gephardt-04!

We all knew Colin Powell was gay, but this is a little much.   Secretary of State   Colin Powell  decided to throw on a hard hat and a hammer to perform a special version of ‚ÄoeYMCA‚Äù at this year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s international security advisor pride parade in Jakarta.   Rebuffing the pleas of his "wife," who was ‚Äoeliterally begging him not to sing again,‚Äù Powell let loose his inner   Village Person . Always a punny barrel of laughs, Powell told the audience, "President Bush, he said to me, Colin I need you to run the department of state," to the tune of the    NAMBLA   favorite. "We are between a rock and a hard place."  Get it‚Ä"IRAQ and a hard place! It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s also funny because Bush exploited Powell‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s credibility to manipulate intelligence information and start a preemptive war. LOL!

The reviews are in: Washington is raving about Saddam Hussein‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fabulous new look! It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s hard to believe that just seven months ago, brutish American forces drove a chunky, unkempt Saddam out of his dirty hole. But just look at him now‚Ä"the deposed despot has gone from flab to fab. Fashion critic/Director of Iraq‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Special Tribunal, Salem Chalabi, said Saddam ‚Äoehad lost weight‚Äù and ‚Äoelooks fine.‚Äù Sure does.  Meanwhile, on the west coast, the fashionistas at the   L.A. Times  had this to say of Saddam's extreme makeover:   ‚ÄoeIn sharp contrast with the scruffy, disheveled Saddam shown on the December video being examined for lice, the ousted former president was nattily dressed in a charcoal sports coat and crisp white shirt. His salt-and-pepper beard had been neatly trimmed, giving him a look as dignified as a literature professor. His dark hair appeared to have been blow-dried.‚Äù  Yum. A lock for this year‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s best-dressed lists, the Washington Post calls Saddam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new style ‚Äoecombative but courteous.‚Äù   So is courteous the new black?



Aren't carpetbaggers the worst? Who could forget the Republican rant in 2000 against Hillary Clinton for carpetbagging a Senate seat in her not-so-native New York?  Certainly not conservative lunatic Alan Keyes. On principle, Keyes declared back then, "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s willingness go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it." And by "wouldn't," he clearly meant "would."  Here are a few things Maryland's Alan Keyes has done since accepting the Republican nomination for a senate seat in Illinois:  * Accused his Democratic rival Barack Obama of taking the ‚Äoeslaveholder‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s position‚Äù on reproductive rights by voting against late-term dilation and extraction abortions without any provision included for protecting the mother‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s life (And no, I will NOT refer to them as "partial-birth" abortions). Keyes said so logically, ‚ÄoeI would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence, [Obama] has broken and rejected those principles -- he has taken the slaveholder's position.‚Äù Apparently the Illinois Republican establishment also stands firmly with the slaveholders on this one.  * Secured fervent endorsements from ‚Äoehome state‚Äù Congressmen including Speaker Dennis Hastert. Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what Hastert said to Tim Russert on Meet the Press:  "I spent five weeks trying to find good people‚Ä¶I got down into last week interviewing a 70-year-old guy who was a great farm broadcaster in Illinois, He decided because of his health problems he couldn't do it. You know, we were down ‚Ä" we needed to find somebody to run, somebody who wanted to run. And, you know, Alan Keyes wants to run, and I hope he's a good candidate."  Representative Ray LaHood also affirmed his solid support for Keyes, "If the party believes he's the best candidate for the race, then I'm with him."  * Proved himself to be a formidable opponent to Obama. In a Survey USA poll, Keyes was only 39 percentage points behind -- 67% to 28%.

Baby,  I miss you soooooo much.   I mean‚Ä¶I know you cheated on me and publicly humiliated me and then hate-fucked me after I found out, but you are still my baby! Baby, you are the only person in the whole world who is willing to put up with me and my daily marshmallowy douche-a-thons. You were so understanding when I had that miscarriage and lost my other baby, Baby. At least we still can make love ‚Ä" I mean hug and cuddle ‚Ä" in our birthing pool. Please come home, my doughy milky body misses you so much it hurts.  Love, Tina

Oops, Republican Congresswoman and international embarrassment Katherine Harris did it again.   Our most trusted vote-counter, most beloved citrus heiress and most qualified Congresswoman has left some Midwesterners ‚Äoedumbfounded‚Äù with her claim that a terrorist plotted to blow up the power grid serving the bustling metropolis of   Carmel, Indiana  .  At a rally for the same George W. Bush she impartially worked for as Florida campaign chair, Harris ‚Äoeeither shared a closely held secret or passed along second-hand information as fact‚Äù by revealing to the 600 person audience their impending doom.   Officials in Washington and Indiana have substantiated her assertion.  A staffer from the House Intelligence committee admitted that he ‚Äoehad heard of no such plot.‚Äù   While local sheriff Doug Carter contended, "I have no information to corroborate any of that."  So how does U.S. Rep. Harris defend herself? "I was told in an open, group (AA meeting) that a recent situation threatened a Midwestern community (Bush‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s presidency) and that it had been diffused (did I douche today?), I regret that I had no knowledge of the sensitive nature of this situation (I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m a total idiot) and any undue concern this may have caused (Pussies!)."   Lady Miss K went on to say that on her watch, the US has thwarted 100 terrorist attacks since 2001. "Actually, it's been more than 100, It's classified...obviously not classified to me...but things I can't go into details about."  Sadly, Katherine Harris does not serve on the Intelligence committee.

"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."

SHIELDS: One thing that surprised me this week, Bob, was that the -- in Florida, the whole electronic voting fiasco and debate raged, and Governor Bush said, Oh, it's OK. Don't you worry about it, even though there's no record, while the Republicans in Dade County are saying, Vote absentee, which suggests that maybe Florida's not flawless.  NOVAK: I think there are plans under way by the Democrats to try to steal this election...

I'm not even making this   up :  "Republican congressional candidate James L. Hart acknowledges that he is an 'intellectual outlaw.'  He is an unapologetic supporter of eugenics, the phony science that resulted in thousands of sterilizations in an attempt to purify the white race. He believes the country will look "like one big Detroit" if it doesn't eliminate welfare and immigration. He believes that if blacks were integrated centuries ago, the automobile never would have been invented.   He shows up at voters' homes wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a gun, and tells them that 'white children deserve the same rights as everyone else.'"

"I do think we've become obsessed with beauty and the fountain of youth and, frankly, personally I'm really saddened by the way women mutilate their faces today in search of that"  -Halle Berry
