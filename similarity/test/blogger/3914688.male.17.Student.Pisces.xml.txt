Â   Well, it looks like I wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be posting anything here for the next few weeks due to inevitable circumstances, namely a trial exam. Now is probably the time when I should throw up my hands in despair (this blogâ€<sup>TM</sup>s name would dictate that I throw up my paws) and wonder why things like this happen to good people (again, the blogâ€<sup>TM</sup>s title begs to differ). Anyway, Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ll just have to put up without Net access for the next three-and-a-half weeks. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m so underprivileged.  A classmate had a birthday on the 15th and a great big chocolate mousse cake. I had two pieces but no more. Poor me... Oh well, I suppose some people are generous, unlike yours truly. One wonders why nobody signs off as yours untruly?

Here I am again!! I got an 80% on my music theory exam and Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m so glad and proud of me! To more serious stuffâ€¦my exams start next weekend and I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t studied much yet! Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m so dead, except maybe in my English, because thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s my strongest subject, but still, lots of scholarships depend on how well I perform in this exam! Midnight oil burning here I come, unhealthy and anti-environmental though it be!

This is my first post here. For those not in the know, I'm Jonathan and my face looks like Mars up close. A classmate said the first thing I did here would be to put someone down...well, he's right. I would like to say that his genes are identical to a protozoa's.

Well, my sisterâ€<sup>TM</sup>s party went off OK, not like what I envisioned. I did have to spend several milliseconds cleaning up, but I guess it was worth it. Some of her classmates were supposed to bring a karaoke set, but forgot. The karaokeâ€<sup>TM</sup>s absence was hardly noticed, though, since the piano completely dominated the scene for several hours as the more musically inclined ones pounded away at it and the less musical ones sang very off-key songs. Most of the songs were by S.H.E, which was appropriate considering the event, but I would have preferred Bach or Tchaikovsky. The only person she invited who was born in the same year as I was declined to appear as he would have to buy her presents and he was too stingy. Bad Pig Boy (a.k.a. Chu), very bad pig!! In any case, at least no-one had to starve because he wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t there to gobble up everything in sight and no-one vomited at the revolting sight of him eating. (I always think of black holes at his reaction to all things edible. Oh well, all things weird and wonderful, the Lord God made them allâ€¦even Wonder Fools like the Pig!) Some of my exam papers are coming back now, and I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t failed anything so far. The closest Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve come to failing so far is 54 for my Morals paper. It just shows the amoral state Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m in. I blame it on school. Only school would make your ability to remember definitions and your ability to write about all the values someone is practicing when he/she is doing something a measuring mark of your morality. For example, by writing this I am practicing the value of dedication, which means that I am typing this out of my sense of duty. This is grammar-perfect; therefore I practice the value of nit-picking, which means that I am a perfectionist who likes to do things well. And so on. Completely stupid, donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t you think? Anyway, this is all for today. Actually, I only did this because Kelvin has been nagging me to blog even when thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s nothing to blog about. I wonder if he blogs much at all?

This post is just to negate the nonexistent rumours circulating that my sudden absence from the cyber world is proof that aliens exist and that they have an odd and unexplainable interest in kidnapping nerdy-looking high-school misfits to perform macabre experiments on, and that thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s what has happened to me. Well, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not true. Something far worse has happened. Yes, I do mean that. Picture a scene only found in your worst nightmares: youâ€<sup>TM</sup>re sitting at a desk, staring at a blank piece of paper, trying to figure out what the question means and what the answer could possibly be. Also, all around you are your classmates, writing like the world will end if they stop their pencils for a moment. Yes, I was having examinationsâ€"Evil, X-cruciating, Atrociously Mean, Impossible, Nutty and Alarmingly Terrible Inquisitions of Nerdy Students (me). Well, the exams are finally over. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been suffering from Net withdrawalâ€¦I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to think about what will happen to me when SPM rolls around! Anyway, may my dear Chemistry teacher (notice the sarcasm) rot while living and her hair fall out, her breath stink, her butt expand, and her teeth rot for making us take 2 Â½ hoursâ€<sup>TM</sup> straight of Chemistry exams! Not to mention that she came up with questions that even Einstein would have trouble answering, not least because heâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a physicist and not a chemist. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m SO going to fail, not that Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve informed my mater of my impending academic doom. My sister will be celebrating her 16th birthday next Saturday, and so far she tells me sheâ€<sup>TM</sup>s invited 20 girls and 5 boys, not including my brother and yours untruly. Just what I need, a horde of giggling females descending upon my house and discussing whoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s with whom and have you seen so-and-soâ€<sup>TM</sup>s nail polish yet? Oh well, at least I can buy plenty of earplugs just in case. The last two weeks have been horrible. Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>ve been sleeping at midnight, waking at 6, and studying like the sky will fall every moment in between. Terrible. Poor meâ€¦ . Anyway, the sun is shining again and I just realized that Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m feeling a little normal again. That is, as normal as I ever get. Oh, and my sister suggested that I change my haircut. (Proof of how incredibly nonexistent my sense of fashion isâ€"even the local Super Nerd looks better than I do.) Since the teachers have been threatening to cause sudden decreases in follicular population if cranial keratin polymers extend beyond certain measurements, I took her advice. Guess what? I look about 2% more normal now than I used to. I blame my social awkwardness on school.
