    Everybody party! Who wants to hit this first?

Am I the only one who was jolted to attention when the guy who was finally lighting the Olympic torch turned around, and lit what looked exactly like the world's biggest joint? I couldn't believe it. I expected the camera to pull back and see Tommy Chong on the other end with a satisfied look on his face. How did this design get by the Olympic officials? They can't be THAT naive.  Pretty damn funny. At least I've got my lasting memory of the 2004 Games already.

    "Here's to a crippling knee injury this year."

 SUNS: Turning Point    I was all over the loss of Steve Nash. I had convinced myself that Cuban did the right thing when he let Nash walk, rather than overpay and be tied to a 35 year old point guard making $13 million a year. I like Deven Harris, and the recent acquisition of Jason Terry will be bigger than people think (Terry actually has better career numbers than Nash, and lit Nash up like a candle whenever the Hawks played the Mavs).  Then I see the article on the Suns website that breaks down their visit to Dallas to sign Nash. Step-by-step. Hour by hour.  Now you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t convince me that Nash didn't have one foot out the door even before Cuban and Donnie Nelson talked to him about staying. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s fine. But don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t act like you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re ‚Äoehurt‚Äù that the Mavs didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t make the effort to keep you. Nash fell for a freaking leather bound fake coffee table book with details about the ‚Äoestoried history‚Äù of the Suns franchise. The franchise that was SOLD the day before. The franchise that hasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t won a playoff series since 1995. The win over the Spurs in 2000 doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t count- Duncan was out that series.  So after meeting with Cuban in the morning, Nash and his agent get whisked away to a luxurious house, by limo, where they meet with all the Suns brass, including Amare Stoudamire, Steve Kerr and Rex Chapman. I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sure Nash and his agent had no idea! They all kiss his ass and talk about how much they want him and how he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the missing piece that will lead them to championship glory. Then ‚ÄoeThe Closer‚Äù, as Stoudamire is called, delivers the sales pitch of the year:  ‚ÄoeLook, I need you,‚Äù he said with conviction. ‚ÄoeShawn needs you. Joe needs you. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re a young group, but we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re talented. We get a leader like you to show us how to do things, that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a wrap. We‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re going to get it done. You know what I mean?‚Äù  I mean, how could Nash say no to that?   Still, this is all fine. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s free agency. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the time to be wined and dined and flattered. If I were Nash, I would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve made them have chicken fights in the pool for me while I ate filet mignon.   But here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s driving me crazy. And why the Suns will not make the playoffs this year and Nash will miss 25 games with an injury: THEY FREAKING TOOK PICTURES OF THE WHOLE SONG AND DANCE AND PUT THEM ON THEIR WEBSITE! It looks like such a pompous slap in the face. They're all smiles and toasting champagne and you can almost see the knife in Steve's hands as he raises his glass. He sure looks heartbroken about his decision to leave Dirk and Finley. They say he called his Mavs teammates to talk it over with them. Then he called Cuban to see if he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d increase his offer. But he never told him what the Suns were offering. Only that ‚Äoetalks were serious.‚Äù Then, after all this, he commits to the Suns with the free agency period less than 24 hours old.   And that legendary Phoenix Suns franchise has the nuts to post their celebratory pictures on their website. They will not survive this.  I loved Nash when he was a Mav. But I wish disaster on him and the Suns this year, and will take great delight in Jason Terry going off for 40 against them.

I thought they've long been linked....  From the New York Times:   On Tuesday, team officials opened The Philadelphia Inquirer to a headline that said: "Owens Dances Around Questions About Sex." The headline referred to a question-and-answer article in the September issue of Playboy magazine. The interviewer stated that Jeff Garcia, the former San Francisco quarterback with whom Owens had a contentious relationship, has "denied media rumors he's gay." Owens was then asked, "What do you think?"  Owens replied: "Like my boy tells me: 'If it looks like a rat and smells like a rat, by golly, it is a rat.' "  Speaking with reporters after Tuesday morning's practice, Owens repeated those words, but he said that the interview was only a "loose conversation" and that "everybody is going to make a big deal out of it, but it wasn't like I came out and said Jeff was gay." He said that Garcia had a girlfriend when the two played together in San Francisco.  Garcia, who now plays with the Cleveland Browns, said he would not respond to "ridiculous, untrue allegations." Rita Addessa, executive director of the Pennsylvania Lesbian and Gay Task Force, called on Owens to make a public apology.  "The equating of gay men to vermin is appalling," Addessa said from Philadelphia. "We need to encourage the Eagles and Owens to make a public apology and for the Eagles to publicly discipline Owens. These comments that equate gay men to some inferior life form do real harm, creating a cultural environment which justifies violence against gay and lesbian people."

 Jeff Garcia -- "I'm Not Gay" -- Outsports.com   Now all of you bitches, leave Garcia alone!  Wait a minute, why'd he sign with the "Browns"?

    Parcells wishes he could make the media talk to the hand.

I feel sorry for the poor Dallas sports media. Although they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have anything of importance to ask Bill Parcells during his LENGTHY, DAILY press conferences, they are forced to think up ‚Äoepressing‚Äù questions to pepper him with. They act like they are well-thought-out and important questions, but they sound more like Chris Farley‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ‚ÄoeThat‚Ä¶was‚Ä¶AWESOME‚Äù guy. Standing at the feet of the master, just kissing ass.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve decided to monitor some of the more humorous and ridiculous questions and present them to you. I sure hope that Parcells and his coaches are all sitting in their offices doing shots and making bets on the over/under of stupid questions.  ‚ÄoeIs there anybody you are anxious to see in the upcoming pre-season game?‚Äù  (Parcells names about everybody on the team- like any coach would- THAT‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>S WHAT PRE-SEASON GAMES ARE FOR!)    ‚ÄoeWhat does Vinny (Testaverde) have to do to get to where you want him to be?‚Äù  (Get in shape. Practice.)   ‚ÄoeWhat do you like about the Tight End?‚Äù  (I couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t leave this one out)    ‚ÄoeIf a quarterback misses a day of practice, is that like another player missing a week?‚Äù   I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe Parcells has the patience for this ordeal. Maybe he could use the time to eat broken glass or see how many toothpicks he could shove in to his eyeballs?

From the Atlanta Journal Constitution:   First order of business for the Hawks' new team-leader, Antoine Walker? Recruiting free-agent center Erick Dampier.  Yep. It said   the Atlanta Hawks' new team leader .   Flush.

 Basketball Is in a Whole New World (washingtonpost.com)   Finally, a rational and positive column about the US basketball team. Sure, it's hip and trendy to proclaim the death of USA's world dominancein hoops (usually by surly old-time media hacks who can't think of an original column idea and who don't have ESPN Classic to rectify those romantic visions of 60's and 70's bball stars who "could shoot and defend").  The rest of the world is much better in bball than they used to be. The original Dream Team set the bar. The international kids could finally see and dream about where they needed to go. They're getting there. However, don't lose sight of the fact that we are still the world power. The primary reason for our less-than-completely-dominant stature in international competitions is that WE DON'T CARE. There. I said it. The NBA is it for us- and it's getting to be for the rest of the world too. Somehow I think that that kid listening to The Roots in Belgrade would rather watch A.I. and KG than another FIBA game.   It's all for the greater good of the game.

Everyone is lamenting the Mavs. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re burying them already. Nash gone. Antawn gone. Antoine gone. You know what this really means? It means all the obstacles have been removed. This is now completely Dirk‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s team, and judging by what he did last week against Team USA, this will be the Year of Herr Nowitzki.  It took the shedding of the most of the hangers-on in Wu Tang Clan before we saw the true virtuosity of Method Man (TV shows excluded). Even Justin Timberlake came in to his own after blowing up N‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>Sync. Now it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Dirk‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s turn to turn in to the man. In the past, he was too obliging- not wanting to ruffle any feathers of the established teammates. And he was patient and young enough to give in to some of Nellie‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s crazy experiments. Something tells me there will be a different hierarchy this season. Dirk will demand the ball.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not saying the Mavs win the title. But it will be the year of the Dirk.

    Dirk will own the NBA this year, like he owned Team USA.

Alright alright. Now that every hyphenated-American transplant has had a couple of days to holla at the top of their lungs,‚ÄùSee! See! We have caught the USA in basketball!‚Äù, let me take a minute to explain how misguided they are. And how completely wrong.  Granted, losing to Italy by 20 points looked ridiculous. But, like most wishful thinking, once you wipe away the surface, the truth is revealed. The US team is set up to fail at these international tournaments. For chrissakes, they aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even playing basketball as they know it. They are thrown together, and have a week to learn a completely different basketball philosophy. It has driven me nuts my entire life that we invent the sport, and years later, it is exported and turned inside out, and then presented as the ‚Äoecorrect way‚Äù to play. We invented the guitar solo too. You think Yngwie Malmsteen does it right? I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m thinking of another four-letter word‚Ä¶.  For starters, international basketball removes the presence of the power game. The best big man of all time in global basketball was freaking Arvidas Sabonis. You ever see him post up? Exactly. Big guys are merely taller jump shooters in int‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>l ball. And the officials (they are a whole other story- more later) have no idea how to call a game involving someone like Duncan (maybe it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the goatee that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s tripping them out- and the fact that he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s actually throwing some mean looks around), and especially Amare Stoudamire, who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s entire Dawkins-like existence revolves around putting his opponents face through the glass. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s too much for these refs. He scares them. He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big man who doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t park it outside and shoot threes.   The ‚Äoerules-changes-for-the-sake-of-making-the-game-un-American‚Äù mess with the US guys. First of all, WHY were these changes made? It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s like the CFL- the game looks familiar enough to still be called football, but the goofy rules changes make it just different enough that it can call itself  ‚Äoeits own game‚Äù. Whatever. Throw ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>em a bone. Deep down. Both FIBA and the CFL know they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re irrelevant. Their fans do too. If not, why was every fan wearing LeBron jerseys in the stands the other night? Two words for anyone who thinks otherwise: Antoine Rigadeau.  Like anyone who‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ever played ball knows, you start messing with the lines on the court, and you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re all off balance. The NBA guys are so dialed in to their game, that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re playing normal D, and before they know it, what to them is a mid-range jumper for their man, suddenly is a three. And why do these teams that beat the US take such pride in banking in straight-on jumpers. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not skill. That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a fluke. And you know it. Flukes happen. Toby Keith is still putting out records and Redman has a TV show.   And in international basketball, it always comes back to the refs (Walton wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t let this one go through the entire broadcast, so it must be true). Traveling? Seven times in a game??!! GO BACK TO JUNIOR HIGH GIRLS GAMES!!! I feel like I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m watching my old social studies teacher on the court. No concept of aggressive D. If a US guy breathes on his man on the perimeter, he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s whistled. Meanwhile, Duncan takes a plate of lasagna in the face while attempting a layup and the refs look at each other (partly cuz they don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t speak the same language- another nice move, FIBA).   OK. Enough excuses. Dirk almost beat them single-handedly the other night. (But he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s about to break out HUGE this year. No more Antoine/Antawn to get in the way. And his ‚Äoebig brother‚Äù Nash is gone. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s his team. Potential MVP season- no, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m not in a Becks-induced stupor). But the US was a little better against Germany than the Italy game. Give them a few more games and let their confusion subside, and their pride surface. The hated Bosnians are next.

 Page 3 - They're playing bas-ket-ball   Not a bad article on this, but there is no NBAer in history that is less hip hop to me than Jordan. He was so corporate from the get-go that he never had an image of his own. And he never came across as dangerous or "from tha hood." And thenthe writer has the audacity (or ignorance) of comparing Jordan to Chuck D. Although Chuck isn't as volatile as he used to be, he is still anti-mainstream and rebellious. Jordan? I think he just made another underwear ad.

 ESPN.com - Dick Vitale - vcolumn040817TeamUSA-future   Oh wait- Vitale has never done that. Granted, I agree that it would be cool to send the NBA champs to the Olympics to represent the USA. But within a millisecond of considering this, a few problems slap you in the face:  1. What if a team with a contributing foreign player wins the title. It wouldn't have mattered much this year, the Pistons had Mehmet Okur from Turkey as their sixth or seventh man and secret weapon Darko Milicic as their cheerleader with dyed hair. But say the Kings, with Peja, ar the Mavericks with Dirk, won the title? Doesn't that kind of put "Team USA" at a considerable disadvantage in the Olympics?  2. Injuries and fatigue. The NBA champions just got finished playing a marathon of over 100 games. They won the title 6 weeks ago. I'm sure several of them have injuries, rehab or off-season surgeries to attend to so they can be ready to defend their title in November.   3. There's no way a NBA champion could repeat in the year following the Olympics. They would be wiped out and have no time to rest and heal. I don't think any NBA owner would agree to this.  4. The NBA marketing machine wouldn't allow it. They want to sell swag with superstars' faces and numbers on it. They want to put their rising stars on the international stage. Tayshaun Prince wouldn't sell. End of story.  So, thanks for your opinion Dickie. But next time give it a little more thought.

 DallasNews.com | News for Dallas, Texas | Sports    "We expect to come out of the meeting with a comprehensive schedule of frequent negotiating sessions and are committed to making every effort over the next 30 days to reach an agreement," Daly (Bill Daly, NHL's Chief Legal Officer) said.  Let me get this straight. The league and players have known for several years that their agreement expired on September 15, 2004. They barely meet for 2 years. Then, when they schedule a meeting, less than a month before the lockout, it's a meeting to schedule more meetings. With leadership like this, it's no wonder this league is fading. Don't you feel like you and 3 buddies could get this thing done over a weekend?

Clippers boss Donald Sterling needs his players to do a little more if they want to really get paid!    NBA Owner In Sex Scandal - August 12, 2004

My ears are ringing from the screams of every damned sports writer (and non-sports writers who feel the need to profess they knew it would happen too) who feels obligated to put on his Bill Russell USA jersey from the 1956 Olympics and scream, ‚ÄoeI TOLD YOU SO!‚Äù Everyone thought a USA loss was possible, just not in the first game of the tournament, and to the lowly Puerto Ricans. Today, they're all talking like they predicted it.  ‚ÄoeSee! They can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t shoot! They can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t pass! They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re just a bunch of spoiled millionaires that hate their country!‚Äù They may as well pack it in and head home. They‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not going to win a game.   Everyone is searching for answers. How could we be losing our stranglehold on our game? We used to just roll the balls out there and pick up our gold medals. We still have that attitude, at least USA Basketball does. And the almighty NBA does too. It was inevitable that the USA would lose in the Olympics. Hell, they got drilled like a Snoop Dogg groupie at the World Championships in 2002. Although that team had an excuse, they were coached by George Karl and actually had Raef LaFrentz on the team.   Raef Freaking LaFrentz .   We lost the tourney and we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t change anything aobut how we select our international team. And that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the whole problem with this thing. NOBODY REALLY CARES. I mean, really, cares. Now, after a stunning loss, everyone acts like they care. But where were all of these experts when the team was picked? Unlike the rest of the world, we Americans don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t even think about international competition in any sport until NBC tells us to every 4 years. In Australia and Japan, the swimmers that compete in the Olympics are national superstars. Our own track athletes have to go to Europe to gain fame and fortune. Basically, we don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t want to hear about Olympic sports. Give us the NFL!  We invest so much time and money in to the NFL, NBA, MLB, NASCAR and MLB, there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no room for other sports. Ask soccer. It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been knocking at the door and peaking in the window for decades. The fact that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not up in arms about FIBA basketball and Olympic competition leads to several factors that have combined to give the former Goliath USA a black eye:  - The best players aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t here . I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sick of hearing about this, so I won‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t bore you with it.  - There is no leader . Who is the Big Cheese in USA Basketball? (tick‚Ä¶tick‚Ä¶) There is no central voice that designs a plan for the US team. Somebody names a coach. The coach (when he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not coaching his NBA team 20 hours a day) names his team. Nice.   - The NBA money machine controls USA Basketball . They want the most marketable faces on the team. Not the best team.   - No preparation . The guys get together 2 weeks before the games after laying around for three months after a lengthy NBA season. Not only do they barely know each other‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s games, but they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re not back in shape yet.   - The international game . It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a different game. New rules and crazy officials have the pro players scratching their heads- and frustrated. Doug Collins was repeatedly warning the viewers yesterday that you never want to be involved in a close game in the last 2 minutes in Olympic play because the referees couldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t be trusted.  - We are teaching the world to play . Many of the players on international rosters have directly benefited from American coaching. Be it in the NBA, college or even hiring NBA coaches to lead their teams (Del Harris coaches China, Donnie Nelson coached Lithuania in the World Championships). That‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s an on-going theme throughout all of the Olympic sports though. Watch during the games how many times foreign medal winners either currently train in the US or trained here.  Nothing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to say that the US doesn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get their game together and their hearts involved enough to win the gold ,but the players that are competing are fighting several obstacles that they aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t used to. Just realize that they are ‚Äoevictims‚Äù of a dated an obviously ineffective system. The wake up call is coming to change USA Basketball. But do we care enough to listen?
