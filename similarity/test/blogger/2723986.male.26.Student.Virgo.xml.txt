Well, I got a 78% on my calculus exam.  Not the greatest, but if I pretend it's a score at GameSpot I feel much better about it.  Now all I have to do to is survive two more tests and the final and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m good to go.    A rousing game of  Double Dash!!  is sounding pretty swell right about now, so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to cut this entry short, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll add more later if I can muster up the motavation.   Quote of the Day    ‚ÄùDon't mock me, my friend. It's a condition of ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>mental divergence.‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> I find myself on another planet, Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way...I can feel, breathe, hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?‚Äù  ‚Ä" T.J. Washington from 12 Monkeys

On Monday I took my calculus exam and should be getting the results back Thursday.  Anything over a 75% would be just fine in my book.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll post my score here as soon as I find out ‚Ä" yes, even if it ends up being a 12% or something equally abysmal.  Other than that there isn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really much going on so far this week, just the usual school/work/sleep pattern that normally takes place.  I did receive  R: Racing Evolution  in the mail the other day, and it looks to be an enjoyable, if unspectacular entry into the racing genre.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll get a review written up for Thunderbolt and Diehard Xbox as soon as I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve put in a bit more play time (I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m about 15% through the game), which will hopefully be by this weekend.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m using my GameFAQs RotM gift certificates to purchase Godzilla: GMK on DVD, as well as a few books and bargain games I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been interested in.  I never did rent any of the new Godzilla movies while I was in Japan, so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m glad they are being released over here, with original Japanese language tracks no less!  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be sure to post a mini-review as soon as my shipment arrives.  Well that about wraps this blog entry.  Till next time, Peace!

It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a fairly unexciting weekend overall.  Most of my time was spent cramming for my first calculus exam, the outcome of which will determine whether or not I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m screwed in the class or not.  Since I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t taken college algebra and trig in about 8 years, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been forced to jam a shmack-load of theorems, properties and the like into my cranium, all the while keeping up on the actual Calc stuff.  Yippie!  Rebecca, my girlfriend, did come over and keep me company for the better part of Saturday though, so that helped make my studying not quite so dismal.  During one of my breaks both us headed out to find a local Asian market, with the goal of finding some furikake (rice toppings ‚Ä" tiny pieces of seaweed, egg, shrimp, fish, etc) and instant Japanese curry.  We ended up at a Korean-owed place with little selection, though I did mange to pick up some Japanese  non -instant curry as well as a packet of instant  Korean  curry.  Oh well, I think I made out ok in the end.  Late that evening, while surfing the net during another of my breaks, I noticed that the Review of the Month winners had been posted for GameFAQs for October through December.  Curious as to who won, I clicked the link and was surprised to find that I won for both October (for my  WWE Raw 2  review)  and  November (my  Rainbow 6 III  review).  Sweet!  That now means I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have $75 available to spend at Amazon.com on games, books, DVDs or whatever else my heart desires.  Who says there‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s no money in game reviewing?  Heh‚Ä¶  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to end this entry with a dialogue from  Morrowind  that I found especially poignant.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s spoken by a world-weary warrior named Umbra - one of the coolest characters in the game (despite his small role).  So, without further delay I present to you:    Umbra‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Last Words   Have you come seeking me?  My name is unimportant, and my accomplishments are few.  What is the use of knowing my name?  If it will make you more comfortable, you may call me Umbra.  It is the name of my blade, though it may as well be mine.  What are any of my accomplishments in the whole of this world?  I have traveled from one end of the land to the other.  I have killed creatures that can stop a man‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s heart with but a look.  I have the blood of man and mer uncountable on my hands.  I have seen the atrocities of war and the hideous excess of peace.  There is nothing left for me in this world.  I have seen the wholesale slaughter of men, women, entire races of people.  Villages have burned before my eyes ‚Ä" my hand has held the torch, and my hand has thrown water on the flames.  I have been ankle deep in blood, swinging Umbra in a wide arc, all for the glory of the battle, and here I still stand.  I have no more to do in this life.  I have saved whole towns from packs of daedra, and I have slaughtered men for the glory of countless nobles.  All that is left for me is my own death, and the gods have cheated me of that.  All I ask is to die like a warrior, but how can that be?  I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t believe it is too much to ask to die as a warrior should ‚Ä" in battle.  It is my curse, though, that I have found no one that can best me in combat.  Are you the one that can?  Can you come and lift me from these shackles of life?  Come then, be the new wielder of Umbra!

Well, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been back from Japan for about 4 months now and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m really starting to miss it.  There was nothing like buying a scrumptious melon pan and pokari sweat in the morning and embarking on an invigorating journey to Osaka‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Umeda area to browse manga, visit Sega World or just plain hang.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m probably about four issues behind on my favorite manga, WEED, at the moment and haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been able to ogle a current issue of Famitsu for months.  And every Friday I would catch a rerun of the best Japanese cartoon no one outside of Japan knows about: Doraemon.  I still have plenty of school in front of me, so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m stuck firmly in the US of A for the moment, but I plan on applying for the JET program as soon as I get my BA.  In the meantime I purchase/watch the occasional anime and try to improve my Japanese to help keep me feeling connected to my home away from home.    That reminds me,  Lost in Translation  comes out on DVD in a few weeks and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing the quirks of modern Japanese culture (that and Bill Murray is funny as hell).  It was the best movie of 2003 in my opinion, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m also completely biased, as it was acutely natsukashi (dear; desired; missed).  The movie has received critical acclaim from virtually all major film reviewing entities though, so don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t just take my word on it.

Yowza!  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m back so soon?  You betcha!  Ahem‚Ä¶ now what was the point to this entry?  Ummm‚Ä¶ oh, right!  There wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t a point!  Great, now that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got that out of the way I can start spewing random babble that nobody probably gives a rat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s ass about.   Topic 1: Calculus sucks   Let me just get a few things out of the way before I start.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m 26 years old and still in junior college.  Since I graduated high school in ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>95 I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been working for places like Hewlett Packard and Shin Itsu, all the while spending my money on frivolous stuff and embarking on mini adventures like living with my girly friend in Japan and the like.  I never really had an academic plan, other than to earn a ‚Äoegeneral transfer degree‚Äù to a four-year university.  But about a year ago I made the decision that it was time to roll up the ol‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> sleeves and get that damn degree, and pronto.  So now I finally have my AA (i.e. 2 year) degree, but need to take a few more classes in order to transfer to WSU‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s computer science program.  One of those classes is calculus.  Which brings me to my main point: calculus  sucks .  Not only is it tons of work, with daily homework and frequent quizzes, but it is just plain boring.  The sad thing is I still have Calc II and III to look forward to‚Ä¶ ack!  Oh well, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll persevere and keep writing so my creative juices don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dry up in the face of such a hideous subject.   Topic 2: My Gaming Life   Videogames are obviously a big part of my life, so I thought I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d give an update on what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m playing/looking forward to at the moment.  Basically,  The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edtion  is my gaming priority.  Since my previous saved character was on a different Xbox I had to start all over for  GOTY , but I totally enjoyed it because I did things much differently.  I still think it is one of the best RPGs ever created ‚Ä" right up there with  KOTOR  and  FFII & III .  With the Super Bowl just around the corner I have found myself motivated to play some  ESPN NFL Football , which is also a great I might add.   Dynasty Warriors 4 ,  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! ,  Metroid Prime  and the ever addictive  Animal Crossing  are a just few other games that have been the subject of my attention lately.  Obviously the biggest game I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m looking forward to is  Halo 2  (thank you Bungie for bringing back the weekly update!!), but  Ninja Gaiden ,  FF: Crystal Chronicles  and  Fable  are also up there on my Most Wanted list.

What the hell is a blog anyway?  I have no idea, yet here I am starting one up with the actual delusion that I will maintain it any kind of regular way.  Hmmm... could happen I suppose.  I'll just try to keep this updated with current happenings in my videogaming life, as well as other off-the-wall stuff that is on my mind at any particular moment.  Well, peace out till next time.

Sheesh, I guess I should update this thing eh?   Right now it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s Saturday morning and I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m typing away while sitting precariously on the edge of my chair (Stimpy, my cat, is currently using 2/3rds of it as a bed).  I just got done typing up a response to the infamous ‚Äoelet‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s start a new argument‚Äù thread over at Thunderbolt, which has turned into one big bash on the mathematical method of deriving an final score in a review.  Good points have been made thus far, and only time will tell if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll end up being swayed over to the dark side of Zen-like score assigning.  Hrmph.  As far as gaming is concerned, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m still playing Viewtiful Joe quite a bit, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll also almost all the way through PN 03.  Carrying a decidedly old school flavor, PN 03 is good, clean fun, but I question its long-term value.  Maybe beating it will unlock something incredibly amazing, like the option to play as a mecha Tony the Tiger or something similar.  I also picked up TimeSplitters 2 for the Cube during the week, and actually managed to get Rebecca to do a little co-op with me.  Score!  For the past month now I have been terrible at making it in to the gym on any kind of regular basis.  Right now I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to set a goal to get back to my old routine, which consisted of going 3-4 times a week.  One of the reasons I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t been in as much is because my membership is now at 24-hour fitness, and that place is always packed with people.  Lacamas Swim and Sport, a closer gym to my house that I get in free at because I know everyone there, might be a better bet if I want to get back into a steady routine.  On a somewhat related note, Barry Bonds is on the Juice.  What a dummy.  And I'm out.

I guess 90 is my lucky number today, because it turns out for both my calculus and Unix exams I got a 90%.  Not a bad turnaround from my previous 78% in calculus‚Ä¶  I spent most of the weekend with Rebecca, the highlight being a 15-mile hike over Mt. Hamilton.  It was a bit chilly, but clear, so we got to see some great views of the Columbia River Gorge on the way up.  There was even a good deal of snow at the top and we had fun tossing snowballs and watching our dogs wrestle around in the powder.  We also finally got to go see 50 First Dates, and it turned out to be better than I expected.  There are definitely some good, quotable one-liners in it.

Just taking a break from studying to give a quick update.  Yesterday was a nice, romantic V-Day for my honey and I.  About noon I rushed over to the bank so I could deposit a check before it closed to get some cash.  The purpose of this was to get a V-Day gift for Rebecca.  Because she is such a big time chocolate lover (though you‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never guess with her Barbie-like physique) I opted on the box of assorted chocolates in the traditional heart-shaped box.  Later on, after I got home, she paid me a surprise visit and discovered the chocolates lying on my bed.  Ooops!  It turned out ok in the end, because she was so thrilled to be surprised by the box of chocolates on V-Day, even if I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t ‚Äoeofficially‚Äù give them to her.    For our date we originally planed to go down to a Japanese restaurant in Portland, but as it turned out the one we had in mind was small and very packed.  Deciding against the potential long wait, we headed over to the movie theater with the hopes of seeing ‚Äoe50 First Dates‚Äù with Adam Sandler.  Unfortunately, we were foiled again.  Because we showed up 10 minutes before the showing, only front row seating was available.  Not wanting to wait to for the next showing which was a good 2 hours away, we decided to head on over to Hollywood Video to pick up a rental.  We came to a mutual agreement on ‚ÄoeX2: X-Men United‚Äù (great movie BTW) and headed back over to my pad for the duration of the evening.  So now I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m busy studying for my two tests on Tuesday (thank goodness that Monday is a holiday!).  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be my first test for Unix and second Calculus exam.  My goal with the Calculus test is beat my last score of 78%.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m pretty confident I can do it ‚Ä" I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll post the results for both here as I get them.  Other than that no big plans this weekend.  I would like to beat  Beyond Good & Evil  and  Viewtiful Joe  over the next week or so, so I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll try and chip away them during my study breaks.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot...   Quote of the Day   ‚Äù We've got no food!  We've got no jobs!  Our pets HEADS ARE FALLING OFF!! "‚Ä" Lloyd Christmas from Dumb 'n Dumber

Friday I finished reading The Ultimate History of Videogames (well, I started at the point when the NES was being developed).  It was the fastest 400 pages I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve ever read because the book was just so damn entertaining!  It really took me back to the good ole days when I was an even bigger game junkie, subscribing to 4-5 game mags at a time and spending all my cash on games.  Steven Kent, the author, not only travels through every detail of video gaming from the past several decades, but does so in a very captivating fashion without ever creating a drab laundry list of events.  All diehard gamers out there should definitely read through this book.  At the very least it will give you ample ammunition to use in the often hostile and uneducated environments of online video game forums.  I am also on about page 200 of Opening the Xbox, a book about the Xbox project and how it developed within Microsoft.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a good read so far, but a bit monotonous a times with all the smaller players mentioned.  One thing‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s for sure, I have a much greater amount of respect for Seamus Blackly and the other Xbox pioneers that brought the Xbox project to fruition.  Can you believe that MS actually thought about releasing a WebTV set top games box instead of the Xbox?  Scary‚Ä¶  On a final note, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been playing a bit of  Beyond Good and Evil  over the past few days (and shucking my duties to finish  Metroid Prime ,  Viewtiful Joe  and  Dynasty Warriors 4 ).  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m only about 6 hours into the game, but it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s definitely official:  Ubi Soft kicks ass.  They are easily one of the top 3 hottest game publishers at the moment, and for good reason.   BG&E  is a captivating game with plenty of genuine heart and emotion.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a game where you can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t help but truly care for the characters, and the storyline is AAA quality.  At $20 they are just giving it away, so go pick it up ASAP.  Well, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m off to do a bit of calculus and then hit the sack.  After that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to go to bed.  Laters.

School, school and more school.  That about sums up what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been up to lately.  I did get my amazon.com shipment (from my GameFAQs ROTM winnings) on Monday, so that was pretty cool.  The package contained:  -  Beyond Good and Evil  (Xbox) - GMK Godzilla (DVD) - Ultimate History of Videogames (book) - Opening the Xbox (book)  The Godzilla movie is fantastic ‚Ä" it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s easily the biggest budget Gojira movie that I have ever seen.  The editing, camera work, acting, effects and everything else is just so much more polished than I am used to getting from a giant kaiju movie.  Much props to Toho for hiring such skilled people to handle the film.    Godzilla is definitely portrayed as an evil entity, with his cloudy, pupil-less eyes and ruthless attitude, and that does take a little getting used to.  He has been a bad guy before in movies like the original Godzilla and Godzilla 1984, but here you aren‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t persuaded to give him even an ounce of sympathy.  Also, King Ghidorah is actually a  good  guy, and helps Baragon and Mothra defend Japan from the big guy‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s onslaught.    Like I said before, the editing is top notch and all the fighting scenes came out smashingly (heh).  A perfect mix of CG effects and traditional model/rubber suit work was employed during the brawls and everything looks just great.  Mothra and Ghidorah can now be seen flying realistically through the skies, with organic looking wings and all, due to the new use of computer graphics.  And man, does Godzilla know how to fight in the movie!  In one scene he is dealing with Ghidorah and Mothra tries to fly up behind him for a surprise attack.  We see Godzilla‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes shift to the side as he perceives the incoming danger and he quickly whips his tail up to take out Mothra without ever looking.  It sound pretty tame, but the way it was edited and filmed makes it a classic G moment.  Now I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m excited to see how the other two new Godzilla movies turned out, especially Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla.  Maybe I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll win ROTM for January so I can get it from amazon.com.  Hey, could happen‚Ä¶

What a game!  Super Bowl XXXVIII was definitely one of the most exciting in recent years, though the end was sort of a let down in my opinion.  I really felt the Panthers were going to get the upset, but when they gave up that last 20-yard pass it killed them.  Adam Vientieri (sp?) really didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t deserve to kick yet  another  game winner, especially after blowing an easy 31-yard try earlier in the game.  And what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s up with the referees giving New England the first down on that fourth down attempt in the second quarter?  It was obvious in the replays that Smith never got back to the line of scrimmage, but even after a long review the refs said he made it?  Replay was included in the NFL so these things would be called  correctly  fellas, sheesh‚Ä¶  Anyway, it was a terrific game that had plenty of everything for football fans: hard-nosed defense, long pass plays, explosive runs, etc.  I just hope it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be remembered for more than the fact that Janet Jackson showed her boob during the halftime show.

OK, so Matt and James are doing this test thingie, so I might as well jump in.  Enjoy.  1. FULL NAME: Joshua Luke Kramer (note: Star Wars was released in ‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>77, same year I was born in.

Must be the curly locks and muscles. 10. YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT: Well, in 7th grade had to go to the bathroom so bad I pissed my pants while playing center field.  Actually, nobody ever found out because it dried by the time I got back to the dugout.  I then acted like I was splashing water on myself because of the heat to wash it out.  Nobody knew what happened, so I guess that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s more of a POTENTIALLY most embarrassing moment.  Guess the cat‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s out of the bag know though‚Ä¶ 11.YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD: Chicken and rice bento, cucumbers, pears, chocolate Myoplex, black licorice. 12. DESSERT: Again, black licorice.

ARE YOU GOING TO COLLEGE? Yeah, for the past seven years now.  Maybe I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll make a career out of it somehow‚Ä¶ 27. LOVED SOMEBODY SO MUCH IT MAKES YOU CRY? No.  Well‚Ä¶ok, yeah.  So what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s it to ya! 28. SMOKED: Cigarettes, no.  Ganja, quite a few times just after High School.  My friends and I had some hilarious times smoking it, though I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t touched the stuff in about six years. 29. BROKEN THE LAW?: Heh.  This could be a long answer.  Here are a few highlights: some friends and I burned down our rival high school‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s sign, threw a cinder block out of a moving vehicle at parked police car (I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t do the actual throwing), stole a handicap parking sign and 100-club plaque from Shari‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s restaurant along with a bunch of other signs. 30. BROKEN A BONE?: Not really, just hairline fractured by ankle when I was young.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s completely healed now though. 31. CHEATED ON A TEST?: Never.  I trust myself more than some other person. 32. SKINNY DIPPED?: No 33. PLAYED STRIP POKER?: No, just regular old poker 34. PLAYED TRUTH OR DARE: Yeah, a long time ago.

BEEN IN A SAUNA?: Yes, but I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t dig them too much 43. SWAM IN THE OCEAN? Of course, I love the beach!  Though deep water is freaky, as is undertow. 44. RAP?: Hah!  There is a VHS tape floating around somewhere of me doing Sir Mix A lot.  Oh, you mean do I LIKE rap?  Sure, but mostly older stuff. 45. COUNTRY?: Hell no, it is the devil. 46. ALTERNATIVE?: Some. 47. HEAVY METAL?: Rarely 48. CLASSICAL?: Yeah, though it really just depends on what it is 49. OLDIES?: Some 50. SOAP OPERAS?: What the hell? 51.

Plus, what about when you get older? 67. EVER GET ANY BODY PARTS PIERCED?: Nope, probably never will. 68. KILL SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T KNOW FOR $15 MILLION?: I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think I could do it. 69. GIRLS, WOULD YOU DUMP YOUR BOYFRIEND FOR NICK CARTER OR JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE?: What the fuck? 70. WOULD YOU EVER HAVE SEX WITH A TEACHER TO CHANGE YOUR GRADE?: If I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have girlfriend and she was super sexy (ie someone I would have sex with on my own accord) then yes. 71.IF YOU WERE STUCK ON A PLANET, WHICH ONE PERSON WOULD YOU WANT WITH YOU?: Rebecca of course.

STALKED SOMEONE? Of course not, but my friend stalked his ex girlfriend.  That was pathetic.   WHICH OF YOUR FRIENDS.....   93. WILL GROW UP TO BE A MODEL? Rebecca  94. IS GOING TO HAVE THE MOST KIDS? I have no idea.  All my friends know when to wear a jimmy hat. 95. HAVE YOU KNOWN THE LONGEST: That I still hang with?  Probably Josh Tracy. 96. KNOWS YOU THE BEST: Rebecca, hands down.   97. THE LOUDEST: Josh when he‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s had one too many brewskies. 98. IS THE QUIETEST?: Jerry Thompson, though he loosens up with some drink and smoke. 99. MOST LIKELY BE FAMOUS?: Rebecca, she‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s always striving to make a huge splash. 100. CRAZYEST? Josh, back in the day.  He‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s the one who tossed the cinder block at the cop car (though, admittedly, we didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t think it was a cop car at the time, but found out soon enough).

Well, how long has it been since I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve updated this thing?  Two weeks?  Three?  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m too lazy to check, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m sure it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s been a good while.  Today is the first day of Spring break, so that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big plus.  Now I have some extra time to write up a few game reviews and enjoy the warm weather that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been having here in the Pacific NW.  Saturday Rebecca and I took off for the beach (more specifically, to Lincoln City, Oregon) and that was relaxing.  We took my Chow/Lab mix, Emmy, and had some good fun seeing her experience the ocean for the first time.  I want to go back during the summer and do some surfing, though there was a fairly famous shark attack there a few years ago (the guy's board, shark bite and all, is on display at the local surf shop).  Oh well, you only live once right?  Today is Rebecca‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s 24th birthday, so after work I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to head over to her place for B-Day dinner.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve already bought her the present she wanted ‚Ä" the latest in the Nancy Drew PC game series.  She really loves those things.  It‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s funny how she proclaims them the best games on the planet and turns around and talks about how boring Halo is.  The good news is she has no interest in writing game reviews‚Ä¶  Tomorrow I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m going to head over to my friend‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s house to check out his recent purchases of Steel Battalion and a massive HDTV.  That should kick ass.  Hopefully, we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll get some Mario Kart LAN in as well (it goes without saying that we‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll play some Halo).    In terms of gaming, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m currently almost finished with Breakdown for the Xbox, and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes for the Cube.  After that I have Resident Evil 0, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Rebel Strike, Metroid Prime, Beyond Good & Evil, Dynasty Warriors 4, Super Monkey Ball and StarFox Adventures to tackle.  Here‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s to hoping I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t end up with carpel tunnel syndrome over Spring break.    On a side note: the Blazers are going to make the playoffs!  Oh yeeeeaaaah!   Quote of the Day :  ‚ÄoeIt‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be like carmel corn going to the moon.‚Äù  - Josh Tracy

Well, well, well‚Ä¶ I've been a bad boy and haven't posted anything here for quite some time.  Sadly, there really isn't anything exciting to report, just some boring old mundane updates concerning my life.  1)	School is boring the hell out of me right now.  I can barely be bothered to study for Calculus and Discrete Math and, consequently, I'm a little worried about how I'll do in those classes.  Hopefully I can will myself to believe there is something reasonably exciting about these subjects so I can get the homework and studying done - either that or come to the brutal realization that I need these credits for my CSBA degree.  2)	It's now official: I'm a Halo nerd.  Yes, I am buying one of those Limited Edition Halo Xbox bundles.  Now add that to the fact that I've played through Halo multiple times, attend regular Halo LAN parties, have read 2 of the 3 Halo books and currently have a Master Chief action figure sitting on my desk; you can't get much nerdier than that.  Unfortunately, I don't actually have my slick new translucent green Xbox yet though, but I will be picking it up tomorrow.  Yippie!  3)	My girlfriend and I went to the river last weekend to take advantage of the remarkably hot weather we've been having around here (84 degrees‚Ä¶in APRIL??).  Of course, we brought our dogs and enjoyed watching them grow bolder and bolder around fast moving water and precipitous rocks.  My dog, Emmy, is a bit out of shape though and once I had to jump in and lift her out of a dangerous situation because she wore herself out swimming across some rapids.  Both Rebecca and I ended up getting injured on the excursion.  She fell and scraped her shin on some rocks and I had my foot gouged as her dog used it as leverage to climb out of the water.  4)	I'm currently reading the John Carter of Mars books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  They are old copies that used to belong to my dad, and though I did start to read them a long time ago, I never finished.  So, now I'm going to go through all 9 or 10 of them.  It's amazing that they were written about 100 years ago, yet read remarkably like the science fiction of today.  Some of the plot elements seem too contrived, but there is a great amount of epic action and the writing is high quality.  Overall, I recommend them.  5)	On the gaming front, I'm finally playing the stunning masterpiece that is Ninja Gaiden.  It's definitely one of the top games on the Xbox and the best actioner I've played in a long while.  I picked up Dino Crisis 3, NBA Ballers and Return to Castle Wolfenstein last week and have been playing Ballers the most.  My friend Adam and I spent a good two hours playing co-op in Wolfenstein and about died laughing watching our poorly animated soldiers contort in ridiculous positions when jumping or looking straight up.  It's definitely no Halo, but a good first person romp for fans of the genre.  I haven't played much of Dino Crisis 3, but the camera appears to really be as bad as everyone says it is‚Ä¶  Below I've listed a few words and phrases that are often used by my friends and I.  Don't try looking in the dictionary for any of these bad boys.  If you start using any of these on a regular basis, you will become exactly 39.77 times cooler than before.  Honestly!   Schmacked Up Words and Pharases:    Lordeast  - there are too many uses for this word to list here.  It is most commonly used as an exclamation during a particularly intense moment.  Giganterr  - bigger than big, massive  Malarky  - bull shit; to say "that's malarked" is the same as to say "that's fucked up."  Lung Butter  - hurl, throw up, puke, etc‚Ä¶  Zacked  - stupid, lame, dumb, etc..  Sweet Jeez/Holy Jeez  - exclamation of surprise or disbelief  Manky Munkle  - the definition for this is not clear at this time; just use it randomly for the best results  Jet Baby  - a demonic being that hides behind the guise of a children's superhero  Hoo ha  - groin, nuts, balls; Ex: "I once was kicked in the hoo ha."  Consquello  - Ceciadia (sp?) at Taco Bell  Big Decker  - Double Decker Taco at Taco Bell  Oh really fool.  - self explanatory; use often and place emphasis on "really."  Big Eddie  - Any very heavy person riding a motorcycle.  Leon/Dennis  - same as: dumb ass, dummy; Ex: "Whatever Leon‚Ä¶"  Get 'em dig 'em smacks!  - like lordeast, best to say during moments of intense excitment  That's all for now.  Work on these and I'll introduce more during the next entry.  That's all I've got for now.  Unitl next time, Peace!

I might as well just copy and paste the usual ‚Äoeoh man, I haven‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t updated this thing in forever‚Äù sentence that has preceded just about every other entry up till this point.  Sheesh.  So what‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s new?  Hmm‚Ä¶  This quarter is winding down in college.  Finals are just a few short weeks away and then it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be summer vacation.  In reality, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like to continue going to school during the summer, but I can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t afford it and can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t get financial aid due to the fact that I already have an AA degree.  At least I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll finally be transferring over to WSU in the fall and away from this stinking community college.  A buddy of mine was recently promoted to manager at a local Game Crazy, and a few weeks ago he offhandedly asked if I wanted a job there.  The hours at my current job have been sparse lately, so I thought what the heck and went ahead and filled out an app.  Well, a few days ago I dropped in and he asked if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d come in for an ‚Äoeinterview‚Äù on Monday, so it looks like I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be working part-time at a video game store.  Fitting considering the amount of time I spend playing and writing about them.  The only downer is that I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be making a mere $7.50 an hour or something like that, but at least I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll get to take home new games and get free movie/game rentals at Hollywood Video.  My buddy will be the one ‚Äoeinterviewing‚Äù me, so I could probably go in tomorrow wearing a tattered tee shirt, shorts and no shoes and still get the job.    I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m stoked about the upcoming release of  Thief: Deadly Shadows  for the Xbox.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve never played a Thief game before, but from what I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve read of them, they seem to be right up my alley.  I love games set in medieval/fantasy type eras and I equally love open-ended gameplay experiences.  Needless to say, I have it pre-ordered.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll try and get a review up fairly quickly, so check www.thunderboltgames.com around next weekend if you want to hear my overall impressions.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be hitting the books pretty hard over the next two weeks, but I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll update this more frequently throughout the summer, since I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll have the free time to do so.  Ciao!

My sincerest apologizes for not updating this for a while, but I did have a few very good reasons for not doing so.  First off, I flew into Iraq a few weeks ago and was looking to do some freelance photography for a few extra bucks when angry militants captured me.  I was forced to fight my way past dozens of machine gun-totting guards armed with only a shoehorn and a ballpoint pen, but after much commotion I managed to flee to the airport and return safely home.  Okay, okay, so I just freakin‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> forgot to update this thing again, so sue me.  In my last update I mentioned that I might be getting a job at Game Crazy, and that did happen.  In fact, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve already worked about 9 days or so over the past month.  The job is fairly easy, pays decent and I actually like everyone I work with, so I have no real complaints with it.  The only slight downer is we are considered ‚Äoesalesmen‚Äù so we have to work hard at selling system warranties, preorders and MVP memberships (though we do get some commissions on these sales).  Thankfully, all of these things are actually smart things to purchase for customers (especially the warranties when buying a PS2..heh), so I don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t feel like a dirty ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>ol car salesman when pitching them.  Of course, talking about videogames is something that I can do without even thinking and that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big factor in why I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m enjoying the job so far.  I really hope to keep working here part time for awhile, because if I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m here come next May I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll be able get into E3.  Finally!  Hmmm, what else?  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve made a commitment to myself to go to the gym regularly like I did for nearly 6 straight years.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been so bad for the past 6 months or so ‚Ä" I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve probably only been going in like once or twice a month.  During my first six years of lifting weights I only missed 1 week of working out on two occasions; I was that intense.  I plan on rekindling that drive; in fact, I just watched Pumping Iron and stocked up on supplements in preparation.  One of the benefits of working at Game Crazy is free rentals from Hollywood Video, so the other day I picked up a movie I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve been wanting to see for ages ‚Ä" Seven Samurai.  Wow!  It was superlative!  Now I definitely have to rent other Akira Kurosawa classics like Yojimbo and Hidden Fortress.  If they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>re even half as good as Seven Samurai I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll feel I got my money‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s worth.  Errr.. well, you get the idea.  Oh yeah, I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>m now even  more  of a Halo nerd.  Just the other day I was working and opened a freight box to find some new Halo figurines.  I already bought a plain green Master Chief a while back, which is standing proudly on my desk as I write this, so I figured I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t need any more.  Especially since I knew that they‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d never release my favorite multiplayer armor color: white.  You see, to this point there has been green, blue, red and black, but no white.  Anyway, as I dug through the pile of Grunt, Elite and Warthog toys, I came across something shocking at the bottom: 2 white Master Chiefs!  As sad as that might seem to non-Halo junkies, this actually made my day.    The funny thing is, I priced the figurines and put them out in the store thinking nobody would buy them and I could just pick one up after getting paid.  I even hid them inconspicuously behind other figurines hanging on the wall.  Well, later that day some kid comes up to the counter with one of the white Master Chiefs in his hand and I suddenly get nervous.  Soon after, I grab the last white Chief from the store and stick it in the back room on what I like to call ‚Äoepersonal layaway.‚Äù  As if this wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t enough, the kid‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s parent who bought the other Chief comes in with the figurine in a plastic baggie and says it broke (the kid busted the flamethrower it comes with).  She says, ‚ÄoeI‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>d like to get this replaced and since it seems you guys don‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t have any white ones left I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll just take this green one.‚Äù  My co-worker, who knows that we indeed do have another white one in the back, looks at me and I just shake my head like, ‚ÄoeAhh, hell no.  She‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s not getting that last white Master Chief so her kid can slobber on it and break it.‚Äù  He just smiles and keeps his mouth shut and, to make a long story short, I now have a nice white Chief (still in its packaging) sitting right here next to me.  I suppose that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s a big enough update today.  I‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ll end it with a thought-provoking and deeply inspirational quote from the movie Ghostbusters.   Quote of the Day    Dr. Raymond Stantz :  Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here .  Walter Peck :  They caused an explosion !  Mayor :  Is this true ?  Dr. Peter Venkman :  Yes, it's true. This man has no dick .
