I think the excitement of writing the first blog got to me. Was down with fever yesterday and couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t come into work. 88pro believes I was trying to be the "  energizer bunny " and hence the fever. But I can assure that I was at my best behavior....but perhaps not at my best senses when having that cold shower at 10:00 pm after a jog...  I was also reminded that, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not only tiny organisms that can make ones temperature go up a few notches. This monstrous act can also be performed by other beings which although look every bit human as we do are actually aliens beamed down to earth to take over our green planet (killing humans by giving them a heart attack or high blood pressure or just plain old suicide). Of course you know by now that I have discovered one of them here in our team (but this is just our secret...ok??).   This alien (prick) being has to go and spoil my already rotten day by telling me that "when you come to work tomorrow you can do this.....you know when was in organization b they would cut my daily allowance in half if I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t report to work........Then I think I should have stayed away when I was ill". Did I not know of the new king for this region??!! Must check the latest news (CNN.com is it??).  What pisses me off is this dufus has no say in what I do. So why in the world does he have to give his two scents worth when I won't even take it for free.  Of course you may say I am getting peeved over a minor incident........on contraire`....this is one of several such weird encounters!!  I was telling 88pro later that evening that I need to finish his book "Handling   difficult conversations  (in this case also known as 'how to talk to aliens')". Maybe I'll have to carry it around with me and refer it every time I have a conversation with this EEEEVIL being.....    Ok....back to anger management and the book now...........

Well here I am. Finally, stepping into this wide new(for me at least) world of blogging. Although I did create this blog address sometime back it was all thanks to   88pro  that I finally got around to pouring out my thoughts...  My first experience in living in an apartment in a foreign land has been quite an interesting one. firstly buying sheets that did not fit even half of the bed and then attempting in vain to have 88pro hold it while tried to pull the part with the elastic, over the edge was....interesting.   But the most interesting part is definitely..COOKING. Although I had the option of moving in with a friend who assured me that he could cook, I took the bold/stupid (call it what you like)step of moving in with 88pro whose knowledge on cooking was the same as mine.....ZILCH/NADA/ZERO.   Anyways, after five days of cooking i think we both agree that was one of best decisions we've ever made. Who ever knew that cooking would be so eeeaaaasyyyy!!!! Ok ok I admit...a dish thats supposed to take 6 mins to cook takes us about 1 hr!!! But holy crap (ooops... can I say that ??) we made some awsome currys like chicken curry, devilled sausages, fish curry etc etc. But we seem to have this problem with the lentil (parippu). It doesnt tastes like parippu, (well, it doesnt taste bad...but not the taste of my mom's parippu curry) it tastes like raw parippu. Anyone whose an expert in this area please help!!  untill next time...

I had one of the best weekends in ages!! Was having fuuuun fromÂ 9 am to 3 am the next morning.....yeeeehaaaaa!! Those of you who have read   88pros  blog would by now know that we had a day out at the rock islands of Palau.  Â   The best part of the trip (for me) was the jelly fish lake. That experience was soooooooo surreal. Swimming amongst millions of jellyfish was a unique experience I doubt I'll get anywhere else in the world. This was definitely one of the (few??) upsides of my job (i.e. getting to visit exotic places).  Â   88pro also did us proud by jumping into the water without knowing how to swim (granted he did have a life jacket on). He continues the proud tradition of stupid/brave (you decide)Â people from SL, starting with the BIG BUD, who jump into the ocean without the slightest clue as to what needs to be done after landing in water. But of course there are exceptions (did someone say alien prick???!!).  Â   That evening clubbing and pool completed an awesome day. But of course, better judgment tells me "tooo much information...aint good for you".Â Â   Â   TillÂ we meet again....sameÂ Bat-time, same Bat-channel.....

88pro and I decided to create a "fund" from which we would pay for our weekly visits to the supermarket to buy our supplies. Although for some this weekly amount would suffice even for a month, we decided that we were going to live like kings and have absolutely no regrets about it!! While doing our accounts yesterday we realized we had gone beyond our budget. Which is quite surprising since we did not go for anything extravagant, just basic stuff that two guys would need to survive (such as 24 pack of almond snickers, a box or orioles, a box of choc chip cookies, caramel...). Yup.....jus the bare necessities...to keep us from dying of hunger.  Got to go eat now.....Sayonara.

Watched the "Last samurai" the other day with 88pro. That was one goooood movie. Anyways, I will not pretend to be a movie critic because I am not. BUT (did I hear someone groan...), whenever I see such movies I get this weird sense of moral obligation to be a better person, to stand up for what I believe in, to make a difference in this world, to experience all the thrills of life (and all that hog wash).   Ok.....I admit, this does sound extremely corny......but sometimes I feel "what purpose am I fulfilling by this vicious cycle of life that I now live (get up -> eat-> work-> sleep -> getup..)". Should I not be tasting the delicacies of life? And then..... reality strikes (ouch)....whose going to pay my bills?

My partner in crime, 88pro finished his tour of duty and left fot SL a few days ago. It was an honour serving with you comrade! Hereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s to all the awesome dishes we made ....ahh yes the Biriyani, the Fried chicken, the Stuffed turkey........it was so hard to take the wrapping all of those pre-cooked stuffâ€¦  But seriously, for two guys who didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know the first thing about cooking I think we should do some serious patting our self on our backs for how we learnt to cook. Canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t wait to impress the people back home.
