Big Footie Weekend Preview!       Okay, rapid-fire predictions for a couple of the weekends games .... welcome back the Premiership, how we've missed you!        I'll leave Toffees v Gooners prediction to you Drekkers!        Aston Villa v Southampton       Sorry darling, I think Villa will win 1-0.  Watch out for van Damme's interesting free kick style ....  It will be interesting to see how Beattie performs though in front of O'Leary, as the main party interested in signing him ..... For the sake of my FFL points I hope that Niemi doesn't concede more than one!        Man U v Chelsea       I'd love to think that my Devils will do the Blues, but their defence is far to leaky at the moment.  Smith to score, for sure, however I think Chelsea will slip a couple through ...... Drogba will be keen to impress on his Premiership debut and perhaps the other coming from Gudjohnsen        Norwich v Crystal Palace       Interesting that the newly promoted meet on the first day in the Premiership.  Home win for Norwich I reckon, spurred on by the promise of some home-made goodies from Delia ....      Only one Coca-Cola League Championship game that I am interested in, hope to be there too tomorrow afternoon, in the Brighton sunshine ....        Brighton v Coventry       The Seagulls still have a number of 1st team players out with injuries and/or suspensions -  Charlie Oatway, Leon Knight, Dan Harding, John Piercy, Richard Carpenter, Chris McPhee .... etc  - however, after presumably getting a rocket up their rears after the game on Tuesday night, they really cannot play any worse .......  I'm predicting (praying for) a home win.  Up the Seagulls!

Olympic Marathon?       My other half's stamina and determination will be tested to it's limits tonight .... he intends to settle down and watch the ENTIRE opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics (aka the     XXVIIIth Olympiad   ).  3 and a half solid hours of build up and display -  in fact, only a little shorter in duration than Daz's marathon personal best (London - 1999)!

Goodwood Revival Weekend versus OU Study Day?        Well, it had to happen didn't it ..... your 'social' diary is showing blanks for weeks and weeks on end then suddenly two offers come in at once!      No contest really;   Revival Weekend  involves swanning around in fancy clothes and the Open University Study Day involves, well, study and in Croydon of all places ....  might just have to borrow notes from my   fellow students !          Talking of which, soiree Friday evening with 'fellow students'- I'll report back on Monday on all our highbrow discussions!

Debs Devils did the deed -  narrowly  - against Dinamo!         Hardly convincing       -  a touch of Mis-Fortune you could say (bad pun!)  - but you can always rely on Giggs! At the end of the day, away goals count - whoever scores them! So Utd take a slight advantage to Old Trafford with them for the return leg on Wednesday 25 August 2004. Nice to see   Alan Smith upsetting defenders  too - looking forward to seeing him bother the Blues on Sunday!

Can Debs Devils do the deed against Dinamo?          Don't want to dominate this blog too much with footie - although it is a passion, but one last word about tonight's game and perhaps a clue where I get my eternal optimism from. Here's a quote from Fergie about tonight's game (    Champions League    Qualifier) - ManU v Dinamo Bucharest        "Of course it would be preferable not to be in the Champions League qualifying stage," added Ferguson.           "But it has happened in the past - and in fact when we won the competition in 1999."        I hope he hasn't put a 'Murray Walker' curse on the game!

Goodwood Revival Weekend       Yes, there are one or two other things dominating my current life, with the exception of ....        Work       Football     Enviously following   ChopperOnTour     ......... and now the   Goodwood Revival Weekend . Well more the question of 'what to wear'. Pretty much sorted -  begged, borrowed and spent!  For one bloomin' day -  but it will be worth it.        For those of you that don't know much/anything about this weekend, here's a brief intro;     The Goodwood Revival relives the glory days of Goodwood Motor Circuit which, along with Silverstone, was Britainâ€<sup>TM</sup>s leading racing venue during its active years between 1948 and 1966. But the Goodwood Revival is far more than a series of races for historic cars: it is a magical step back in time and a chance for visitors to revel in the romance of motor racing as it used to be.           It is not just the circuit and the vehicles that have an authentic period look. All circuit staff and competitors dress in appropriate period clothing  (click here for more information on getting the look)  from the 1940s and 1950s, as do the majority of visitors, who consider it all part of the fun. Bands play authentic 1950s music, the food outlets sell fish and chips wrapped in 1950s newspaper!     Now how much fun does that sound?!! The 'look' is all important and my friend and I,   Stewart Birch , are keen to make our outfits as authentic as possible ..... I think his might be a uniform of some kind, although I have always imagined he would make an absolute perfect spiv!      My reason for going this year is also to help out a couple of charities;        Winston's Wish       Chichester Boys Club  (mixed youth club)

Seagulls - grounded!       What a depressing first home game for the     Albion - 2-0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle   . Clearly, after two hard seasons I am no longer the lucky home talisman, as that was the first home defeat I have witnessed!       Anyway, the good news is that we are now only 6 points off the top of the table - okay, this might sound better come February, but at least we surely cannot play any worse than we did last night. Hopefully Ben Roberts will be fit for Saturday's home game against Coventry.        The Coca-Cola Football League Championship table

FOOTBALL CRAZY FOOTBALL MAD        Hoorah, the football season has started again. And if you're not already 'doing one' then I can highly recommend the   Beeb's Fantasy Football League  (FFL) - this is the last season they will be running it too (due to cuts in online services), which is a shame as it is a fantastic FREE service and has served my friends and I well over the last 4 or 5 years (however long it is now?). I guess we'll have to resort to one of those lesser, pay per team offerings next season.      Going to watch the   Seagulls  tonight at the 'mighty' Withdean - yes, the one of 'my shed is bigger than this' fame! They are playing Plymouth, who managed a draw on Saturday, so i'll update you the game tomorrow.
