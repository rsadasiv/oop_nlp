Anjali!

remove it!     I finally removed the key of my totalled car from my keyring tonight.  The bulky key had been sitting on my keyring so far just because I always found that the key is far inside of the key ring whenever I tried to remove it.  In order to remove it, I had to pull out all other keys first.  But I did it tonight.  Maybe we do the same way when we have to remove something settled at the bottom of our heart.  Just remove it.....now....

Healing...     I'm in healing process..... hopefully some CDs that I brought from my music cellar (Boulder Public Library) can help this healing process.

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....status     Feb 24, AM 3:11.....Status; at work......

one flight down...   I'm listening to Norah Jones' song 'one flight down' again.....  It's been a while to have a chance to listen this song but the feeling in me is.....more touching and ............  One flight down.... there's song on low... ...........

Beautiful French wedding     It IS possible to marry a dead fiance in France (   Paris Journal: A Love That Transcends Death Is Blessed by the State  ).  How lovely it is....  I want to meet one of them and ask how they feel.  I wish I can feel their emotion and warm hearts.....

Illusion....     I just hope the words, songs, and talks that I had with beautiful-minded friend were not an illusion.  It'll be really hard to admit that a warm feeling settled for a while in my heart was another illusion.....  Just hope that the sun doesn't rise so the images on the window doesn't go away.....

time to say goodbye...     My Golf was totalled because of the accident happened last week.  It was quite unlucky to have theose airbags deployed.  I've got some comments from the vw.watercooled news group that some of the older VW models have quite sensitive airbag sensors.  I partly agree because the speed was quite slow.  The estimated cost for the airbags exceed the total value of my car so it's the time to say goodbye to this poor guy.  I also started a thread at the same group that asking "Am I doing right?".  Some says it's quite understandable for older vehicles but some says why don't I forget about the airbags and secure the seat belt instead.  No..no....I need airbags....  You can read a series of postings under my question on "rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled", with a title "time to say goodbye to my A3"

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....abstract     A glance in the middle of the night.....

Now you can add this link (http://boulderboulder.blogspot.com/atom.xml) to your RSS reader and check my journal more easily!!  This xml link is also found at the bottom of the right pane of my journal.

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....neglected     In the morning....the toys left and neglected on the playground greets me.

Blue Sky.....   I don't think I can look up the blue sky for a while....hopefully just for a while....  I feel like that the sky that I see today is just like the sky of Pink Floyd....

trying to back to normal...     I'm having hard time to get back to normal.  And also trying to take some 'not-boring' pictures but neither of them works fine so far.  I finally took this picture of street light this morning.  I've long been thinking about taking a picture of this light ....so, instead of torture me to take new stuff, I just decided to make myself get used to the past thoughts first.....

done...   Yes, I just gave the preseantion at the conference this aftertnoon.  It's been quite busy days so far but I'm trying to finish the rest of the days smoothly......if I can...

finally     It's the first day of my conference visit to Seoul.  Because of the time constraint and the lack of softwares in the unfamilar machine that I have to use during the week, the pictures will be posted here without any fancy frame editing :) However, I'm quite tired after the 14hrs of flight... still alive thouhg.....  ......Mar.21 morning (local time) update..... I got Gimp this morning so, now I can edit the picutres just like before... yipee!!!

Alone or together

Got ready?   I'm trying to get ready for the conference in Seoul, Korea.  Now I have my presentation file sent to the conference organization so there's nothing left to do with the conference itself.  I just need to be familiar with my presentation :) and on board early Friday morning.  But....I still have lots of stuffs in my hand....about the journal paper, several model re-run, and the next step of the research....gee....  I'm planning to have my Dimage Xt during my trip so hopefully I can post some of nice pictures from Korea.

Blue Sky     This is for a friend who missed the blue sky yesterday.  During I put this picture in the frame, a song from Pink Floyd just came to my mind.... a sad song that a part of their legendary album 'Wall'.  It starts with 'good bye...blue sky...good bye....'.  I don't know why I feel so sad when I look up the sky these days....  Oh, I just changed the size of the picture frame.  Now it is 307 by 410, vice versa.

Perfect cure for cold...     Yes, this could be the perfect cure for cold.....Tylenol Day & Night plus Ricola.....gee.....  What should we take when we caught a cold for our mind?

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....clean     Legally clean....

Flying high     Colorado....is one of the place that has most 'sunny day' around the world.  Actually, over 300 days a year are shiny.  As usual, a high flying plane left a beautiful scene with the sunset.  I wish I could fly like that.......

Set them free.....

Digital version of Rolleiflex   Wow...... The Rolleiflex is one of my dream cameras since I saw this in my grandfather's workshop.  I think I was 10 years old but I just counldn't move my eye from the amazing dual lenz camera.  And today I found that Rollei unvealed it's new ditigal version of Rolleiflex (   RolleiFlex announces first ever twin-lens reflex digital camera : Digital Imaging : MobileMag  ).  I can't wait until it launches on the US market.  Now this beautiful guy is the first item of my wishlist.  Oh....what a sweet piece.  I think I'm gonna go to the grandfather's workshop during the visit on the fourth week of March.  I'll do.

Feeling dizzy     Having no food this morning..... I felt a little bit dizzy.  Coffee just didn't helpful at all.....  Maybe the life itself is similar to this.  Whenever we feel lacking of something, we just pour some bad stuff again and again to our soul and make it really sick eventually.    I'm still searching for a 'button for help'.

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....perspective

Push for help     This is the button on the emergency light located here and there in the campus.  I wish I had a button like this.....

Conference schedule        The conference (   ICHWC 2004 - The International Conference on High-Impact Weather and Climate : Understanding, Prediction and Socio-Economic Consequences  ) schedule is now fixed and I'm going to give a presentation on March 24 at Seoul.  Actually the acceptance of the presentation was made long ago but the notice of the detailed conference schedule has been quite delayed.  It's going to be an important conference attendance in my life, I guess, because I'm supposed to defend my thesis at the end of this year.  I need some support for further research or a research position.

Sorry for temporary outage of pictures...   I've been out of my office during the weekend and I just realized this morning that my machine is off.  Someone may turned down my machine or there was a power outage.  Anyway, it's all back on now....

snow bomb                 After I heard a news about the snow storm in my home town (Seoul, Korea), a pile of snow just covered this town last night.  Here are some pictures of this beautiful snow.  Hmm...but nothing new here in Boulder.

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....natural     It's snowing on the last day of April....It's sooooo 'NATURAL' in Colorado......

power outage, again....     It's the season of power outage!!  This is the third time since last Friday and I'm quite sure that we'll have more power outage through this summer.  BTW, it was not bad today.  I had a cozy and relaxed moment without computer.

miracle everyday     I took this photo at the public library last Sunday.  I didn't realize before that there is such a beautiful painting. Can you bring me a miracle every morning?

sorry...     This is the guy who made lots of noise on my porch these days.  I took this picture this morning, then, I just realized this afternoon that this guy made a new nest inside the wind bell that I tied under the front porch canopy last Haloween.  I'm so sorry dude..... I removed your nest.  Go find a better place for you girlfriend.....sorry....

snow again....     Yeah...it's snowing again.  I'm so happy to see and feel snow again in late April but it was not that cold and was very wet snow.  Oh, and there was a power outage this morning for an hour.  It brought me a very cozy and snowy morning time, which was so good.....    This is the first picture that I do some trick on any of my photo.  I really hate doing anything on the photos but I like this style....a little bit of bright color does give an accent on the calm b&w photo....

BEAUTIFUL!!        Yes!! My new laptop has just arrived this morning.  I've been searching for a new one for a long time because current laptop is quite an old model and VERY heavy.  This beauty is one of the lightest model in the market ....I guess....  It's Fujitsu Lifebook P5020D.  Other considerations were IBM X series and Dell Inspiron 300m but this model is very attractive to me in terms of its connectivity.  It has memory card slots (CF and SD, I use SD only though), external display port (VGA, S-Video.... wow), DVD, etc.....  I love this machine....  Now I'm ready for writing the dissertation.....oh, boy.....

.....     For a friend who has clean and pure heart.....

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....self portrait     This is the TRUE self portrait of my BLOG......MOUNTAINBREAD.....  I just took this photo this afternoon.  It's the past and the present of mountainbread....  Are you happy now? :)

No more snow     Yes, snow is almost gone as of today but I really want more snow.  This is the picture I took during the last snow bomb.  The beautiful flatiron is covered with snow and mist.  You can see the other flatiron picture on my Apr.7 blog below.  That's probably the 'normal' view these days.....

More snow pictures...     This wonderful snow pile on the fence didn't last long.  After I took this, it just melted down (or just fell) less than a half hour.  Lucky...    The window of the famous Grusin Music Hall.  It's a part of the music building in CU.  I've been here in the building once for my friend's recitle but I really hope to be there on any Wednesday's jazz events.... sometime soon....

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....discover     funny.....what are you looking at?

Some....     It's a 'MUST' for kids....    Actually, the temperature was quite high today.  So, the snow was quite wet and melted down very soon.  More pictures to come!!

Snow in April     Yipee.... it has been snowing since yesterday afternoon.  It'll really help improving long lasted draught this area but especially...it's good for my soul.  I love snow. I took this picture just half an hour ago.  Yes, I took a lot of pictures around this town this morning.  I'll post some of them later.

Dirt shirt     Do you remember the younger years when you really didn't care about the dirty shirts or pants?  As we grow, we care too much about ourself that is seen by others.  Sometimes we just can't do something because of others....not because of us.

Back to work     I'm totally back to my research work from last night.  I thought it's almost done but I just found that I have some stupid mistakes in my code....  But there IS a bright side.  I found a efficient way of my interation in the code, so it'll take less computation time.  And this is the first b/w picture on my blog.  I LOVE b/w pictures but I just didn't try on my blog.  I remember the day I first bought a roll of ILFORD b/w film quite a while ago.  The pictures that I took with that films are sill some of my favorates....

cozy feeling....     This is the picture of so famous Flatiron in Boulder.  I took this this morning on the way to my office.  Even though it was not from the place that have perfect view of the rocks, it was quite nice.  After I finish the 'almost-final' draft of my journal paper, I feel pretty cozy feeling with Norah Jones' music.  It is supposed to be crazy day until the end of this year before I defend my thesis, I'm feeling warm and cozy now....at least tonight.....

first time biking...     How many people remember the first day of their life riding a bike themselves?  Do you remember the moment that all the fear and nervousness just turned into a joy and freedom?

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....atmosphere     I took this picture at the training ground of CU Buffs couple of days ago.  Whenever I pass this field, the tall-metal light is so shining with a background of clear blus sky.  Today, we already have three winter storm warning though....

Clear sky        Grandview, Bouder Clear...clear....it's so clear that I have to spend rest of the day INSIDE my office....oh, boy...   And it's worth check the totally diffent color of the day at the other side of the globe...  here

Gmail        Tada.... I've got the Gmail account just a few minutes ago and a couple of test mail went out and in successfully.  Actually, I asked them to have an account quite a while ago.  This afternoon, I just noticed that blogger (a part of google) has a link to get gmail account!  So, I applied...and get on in just a few click.  I think I'm becomming a serious google maniac.   Oh...my gmail?   yeonsang@gmail.com  

PEACE you mean?        Taken at Broadway, Boulder.  Marriage issues are on every newspaper these days.  As a presbyterian, I 'technically' oppose gay marriage but seems like I'm not the only one who have sympathy on this issue.  Last Sunday, Pastor Peter gave a very impressive sermon on this issue and you may want to read it (  First Presbyterian Church ).  During the sermon, a girl just sitting in front of me with his father jotted down his sermon time to time especially when he mention some survay results or give strong opinion on the marriage issues.  It was so funny to see the worrisome father trying to peek at her note.  Oh, yeah, absolutely you want to know what your girl's thinking on this issue....I understand..... 

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....parts        Eternity....the scent that I'm wearing these days.... I wish I could deliver at least a part of this nice smell.  

Traffic light        Traffic light located Arapahoe and 15th, Boulder , this morning. I've been trying to take a picture of light for a while after I saw a nice traffic light picture from one of my   friend's blog  and finally I've got one. The original photo (color) looks also fine but I just wanted to show the cloudy and quite Boulder this morning.  

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....play        Having fun...  

Trace        This is also taken near Canon City Station.  Traces of memory, friendship, love.... does last long.  It's sometimes painful to remember the past but also sometimes make us smile.  

Santa Fe     Taken at the Canon City Station, Colorado.  I was in a short trip to Canon City last weekend.  I have been there once before but it was the first time that I can have a time to stay and wander around the station for over an hour.  In a hot shining sun, I just looked up the sky and took it here.

DIA     Clear sky at DIA.  Anything behind this photo?  It's really getting hot this week.    "Tyrannosaurus' back bone".  I'm having trouble to find best quality picture through my new laptop Fujitsu P5020D, which has 10.6inch wide screen.  Last time I posted the snow photo, I was really fooled by the crisp looking photo through my small display.  It'll take some time to fit myself into this machine.

your universe     Do you have your own universe so you can reside in and feel happy?

clear view     Things are getting messy and timid to me these days even though it's a very critical time to organize and plan the rest of my research.  I wish I could see the things so clearly......

Nail        Sitting there alone for a long time rusted and abandoned....Maybe it's our lives....Hopefully someone find us and take a nice picture of our lives, hopefully....  

Summer Fair        Nederland, Colorado. Taken at the Nederland summer fair.Rusted sign and peeled off paints...A cozy place to just wander around and feel the fresh air on the mountain.

    Warner Imig Music Building, University of Colorado at Boulder.   Sitting alone..and waiting for somebody....then what's next?  

    Finally watched the movie 'love actually'....and now I just can't get sleep because of some thoughts.  I wish I could see things more clear.  

My music cellar        Public library, Boulder, Colorado.   I'm really enjoying the musics of Winton Marsalis these days...especially, the album Joe Cool's Blues.  It's full of Winton's wit and joyful feelings.  Just great.  

    Harry Potter new movie, Fort Collins, Colorado.  

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....landscape        At Boulder Public Library, Boulder, Colorado.  To take landscape....I just looked up.   

Misunderstood....        Present from a thoughtful friend.... Nobody wants to lose anything because of the presents of good intention....nobody... 

Graduation smiles        Graduation, North Boulder Park, Boulder.  May the thankful, joyful feeling lasts forever. 

    On a fine summer day....  

Fly high...        The paper airplane just reminds me of younger years and fogotten dreams.....  

Monotonous....        Public Library, Boulder, Colorado.  Loosing colors despite so many choices just sitting around me.... Hopefully, I still have one over there......far, far away.  

Life being simple....        17th & Arapahoe, Boulder, Colorado.   Couldn't life be as clear as this traffic lights under the shiny summer sky?  Go for green and hold for red....so simple....  

Tired hearts go HERE!        At Color Me Mine, Boulder, Colorado.   What if, there is a place where every exhausted mind can go with the sign in front of the place like "Tired hearts go HERE!"  

Color of kids        It's such a mistery that only kids can use the variety of colors without any hesitation.....  

Feather and fresh feeling...        Clear rain drops on a feather this morning....  A bird lost a feather, and I've got a piece of freah feeling in my heart.  

Clear sky        Boulder, Colorado.   Taken near City of Golden yesterday morning.  Finally, the weather got back to normal.  

Reborn        Nederland, Colorado. I don't know the name of the flowers or how old is the wagon, either.  They just tells me the 'being forgotten' and 'reborn'.....  

PHOTO FRIDAY Challenge....perfection        YMCA, Arapahoe.  I don't see anything more perfect than nature.....A mere nature... I always admire people who can take beautiful pictures of nature.  You can enjoy another beatutiful shot from   my friend's blog.  

    Macky Auditorium, CU Boulder.   I just took this picture after a squash with a good friend of mine.  Before I got on my car, I just realized that the building was showing quite crisp image under the setting sun to the west.
