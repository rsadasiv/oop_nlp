Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  One interesting thing:Â  Matt and I actually went to Christmas Eve Mass at St. Leoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s with both of our families.Â  And we sat over in the â€oePeanut Gallery,â€ and I saw Toni and Tom two rows in front of us.Â  Toni saw me and did a cheesy, weird wave.

Â  Tuesday, November 6, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   3:10 PM Dear Ducky, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Today, again, I want to cry out to you.Â  I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t the strength to ask you many questions, or to tell you many things.Â  I just want to cry to you: â€oeWhere are you?â€Â  I have been here in Seattle for one year, and I am getting used to my daily routine, and I feel less and less acquainted with the past.Â  I live sometimes as if itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the future, as if everything is so far behind me I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hear its heavy footsteps. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The city has made me less open, less noisy, less friendly.Â  The city has made me quiet.Â  I look at things more.Â  No, thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not true.Â  I look at things the same amount, and I have always been very observant; itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s just pretty much all I do nowâ€"I just donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t interact with it all as much.Â  Sometimes when I speak to other people the sound of my voice surprises me.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t recognize my external voice because I most often am using the voice in my head.Â  The Internal Monologue.Â  Sometimes I want to forget everything that has come before and start over.Â  Start from right here and become a whole new person.Â  Other times I yearn for the aches and pains of childhood, the easy tears, the difficult friendships, the comfort of the arms of my parents.Â  More than anything right now I want to crawl on the couch and snuggle between my father and my mother and get hugs and kisses.Â  They are getting older now, and are less inclined to cuddle and hug and kiss.Â  I remembered the night before I moved back up here I was in the living room crying to my dad because I knew that I would never be able to just sit and feel protected by him again.Â  Once you are in your twenties you canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t rely on your parents for snuggles and comfort.Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not acceptable.Â  Maybe itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not because they are old that people donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get hugs, maybe itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s because they donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t get hugs that they are old.Â  Hugs are so necessary.Â  Hugs and saying â€oeI love you.â€Â  My family would always say, â€oeI love you,â€ no matter what, even if we were mad at each other, or said it 20 times a day.Â  Is it possible to say, â€oeI love youâ€ too much?Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think so, but because Matt never heard it growing up, he doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to get used to saying it now.Â  You would think that it would actually be the opposite, that I would be the one not wanting to hear it.Â  Did I ever tell you that I love you, Ducky?Â  Probably we werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t in the habit because we were so young.Â  I wish so much that I could see you to tell you.Â  I wish that we had been able to have a relationship of love and trust and could be growing old together.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have any childhood friends.Â  Who is going to be my maid of honor when I get married?Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know if I have shared enough of my life with anyone.Â  But itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not really as if I could have you do it either: we donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know each other anymore if we knew each other at all to begin with.Â  Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not going to get married any time soon anyway, donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t worry.Â  Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not ready.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know if Matt is the right guy for me if he canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t say â€oegoodnightâ€ and â€oeI love youâ€ to me every night.

Â  Monday, September 24, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  10:59 AM Dear Ducky, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  My friend Tenille came over yesterday after work, and we watched wrestling with Matt.Â  The thing that is interesting about her is that she was also adopted from Korea.Â  She and her three siblings are all from Korea, but only she and her sister Tara are actually blood-related.Â Â  Their â€oeparentsâ€ are white and divorced when Tenille was about twelve.Â  She is the oldest of the four, and is currently 27.Â  Tenille, Tara, Tyler, and Tim.Â  Tenille is very smallÃ she only comes up to my shoulder.Â  She doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t remind me of you in any way except that she was born in Korea and her hair has the same texture.Â  We have never really spoken about her being adopted until about a month and a half ago.Â  She told me about working on her parentsâ€<sup>TM</sup> farm in Eastern Washingtonâ€"like actually slopping hogs, milking cows, sowing corn.Â  Completely different from her big city life now.Â  And she mentioned something about how growing up, everyone said she was always real afraid of men, especially her father, even though he had never done anything to harm her.Â  And she has a horrible fear of being grabbed from behind and things covering her head.Â  She still cannot wear hoods on sweatshirts or hats.Â  She will just start shrieking and thrashing.Â  She says her mother once said, â€oeTenille, something terrible must have happened to you.â€Â  What could have happened to her?Â  She came over when she was two years old, half the age you were when you came.Â  And still she is having problems and feeling the effect of her infancy in Korea.Â  She has trouble getting close to people and canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t maintain a relationship.Â  She is also an alcoholic.Â  Is any of that related to her being adopted?Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know.Â  But she is definitely experiencing things that others do not. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s funny, because I never think of you as different, I never thought you looked strange, or anything.Â  I always thought you were much more beautiful than me.Â   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I remember the scar on your forehead, between your eyesâ€"I used to say that it looked like the top of a loaf of bread.Â  Where did you get that scar?!  I am beginning to realize that Anne of Green Gables meant something totally different to you than to meâ€"of course!Â  Why did I never realize it before?!Â  Anne was adopted, just like you, and Anneâ€<sup>TM</sup>s hair made her look different, just like you looked different.Â  Did you get teased like Anne?Â  Did you feel alone like Anne?Â  And here I have been, all these years, selfishly thinking of myself as Anne, when really she was you all along.Â  I am an ASSHOLE!Â  Ugh!Â  No wonder you never told me anythingâ€"I was too stupid to understand!Â  Of course we fought over Gilbert!Â  He rightfully belonged to you because he always loved youâ€"not me, ugly, stupid Diana.Â  Although I have been trying to read Ben Hur like Anne did.Â  It is thick and a little hard to get through, even for me, the avid reader.Â  And I guess with you being Anne, you stealing and secretly ordering pizza made you â€oecorrupt,â€ just like her.Â  Oh, Duk Sook, I am so sorry.Â  I am so sorry.  Hey!Â  Wait a minute!Â  What about the summer after I graduated from 8th grade and we were at the St. Leoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Parish Picnic, and I went swimming, and you refused to go?Â  We were at Hanna Boys Center, the home for â€oebad boys.â€Â  Was there something going on then?Â  Were you somehow involved with someone there?Â  I remember I had thought that you were acting very strange that day.Â  You seemed very uncomfortable.Â  What happened?Â  Remember I was flirting with that black kid named Eric, who kept trying to call me and we were never home?Â  I had just had my first kiss on the last day of school some months before.Â  I was finally a woman.Â  But you had already had sex and drugs.Â  I must have seemed so young, so naÃ¯ve, so boring, so unbearable.Â  And itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s funny, because out of all of my friends, I was the first one to have sex at 15 (exactly one month after my birthday) and it was a long while before anyone else caught up.Â  Fifteen was supposed to be really young.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t found time for myself to write all summer.Â  I have worked myself into oblivion.Â  I am just all around tired and not feeling able to do anything at all.

Â  Monday, August 13, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   8:28 PM Dear Ducky, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Do you remember when we had head lice, Ducky?Â  Remember when they â€oeshavedâ€ your head, and only cropped mine? Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Where do lice come from, I wonder?Â  How do they begin?Â  And who had lice firstâ€"you or me?Â  Whose school had the epidemic?Â  Who is to blame?Â  My memory wants to say that your parents blame me, that you could never be dirty enough to cause suchâ€¦contamination.Â  Did we have to stay home from school?Â  I remember the word â€oequarantine,â€ and not quite understanding, and then a strange association with the word â€oeturpentine.â€Â  Where did that come from?Â  Perhaps I recall stories of children with lice having to dip their heads in turpentine.Â  Yuck.Â  The thought of that makes my stomach try to crawl up my throat for fresh air. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I remember coming home from the barber (yes!Â  I actually went to my dadâ€<sup>TM</sup>s barber!) and all of our furniture was coated in plastic.Â  Our whole house felt ghost-like.Â  My father had rented â€oeDumboâ€ for my brother and Iâ€"I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know whether it was out of pity or for a distraction. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t remember much else at allâ€"weird shampoo that made huge bugs fall out of my hair that I hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t even known were there.Â  They made a gruesome sound as they hit the porcelain tub.Â  How long were we out of school? Â Your hair had been long and thick, and with the â€oeepidemic,â€ your hair had to be cut like everyone elseâ€<sup>TM</sup>s.Â  It was cut without rhyme or reason (because the hairdresser hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t known how to cut your â€oekindâ€ of hair?).Â  Or maybe it was your father who cut it. Â It stood straight out from your head as if youâ€<sup>TM</sup>d been shockedâ€"and your eyes, no longer able to hide underneath your bangs, echoed that perception. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  With your hair gone, you looked different, and you acted different.Â  It was as if the loss of your hair killed a part of you in some way.Â  I only remember you with long or incredibly short hairâ€"nothing in between.Â  And I realize that Toni had always had really short hair, and so she probably had no idea how to style your hair or make it pretty like the other girls in your school (or even how it would have been done in Korea). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Was that hard, being different, being strange, and not looking like the other students?Â  I realize that we never talked about thatâ€"or it never came up.Â  I was never aware if anyone teased you or made fun of you.Â  I have no idea what school was really like for you.Â  Maybe part of the reason you ran away was because you were treated badly by your schoolmates? Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I guess growing up, I never realized that it could be hard for you, that you would experience different things than me and ultimately be hurt by these things: it never crossed my mind. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Maybe I really wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t a good friend to you.Â  Maybe you were right in choosing not to confide in me.Â  Maybe there was no way for me to help you, or to even understand.Â  I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t possibly have had any answers for you.

Â  Thursday, May 24, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  11:40AM Dear Ducky, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I had a weird dream about you last night, Ducky.Â  Actually, you were only in it for a few momentsâ€"the rest of it was with your parents, Toni and Tom.Â  Let me see if I can remember and explain.Â   Basically I was riding a bike through your neighborhoodâ€"you know, Fano Lane and all that.Â  Although I guess itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not your neighborhood anymore since even Toni and Tom have moved away.Â  Anyway, I was as old as I am now, riding that old pink bike I had with the banana seat (I have no idea how I recalled that item out of the recesses of my memory).Â  All of the houses looked like they belonged in Disneylandâ€"they Â were just a bit too small to look real.Â  And the houses were basically just facades: brightly painted and cheerful and pretty, but aside from the outside walls, there was nothing else inside.Â  They were like the empty sets at Universal Studios.Â  They all had amazing gardens with ponds and pools and waterfalls with very blue water.Â  I am realizing that it looked a lot like Munchkinland in The Wizard of Oz.Â   At the same time there seemed to be a lot of peopleâ€¦yet it was totally deserted and I was all alone.Â  Everything was moving in slow motion, and there was music coming from somewhereâ€¦I finally came to that little street your house is on from the other side, and there wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t a real road.Â  There were shallow canals of that bright blue water, and all the houses were very close together.Â  The only place for me to ride my bike on was on a very narrow, curvy catwalk-type thing.Â  I had to bike very slowly, and I ran the risk of falling in, which would obviously poison or kill me in some way (remember playing â€oeHot Lavaâ€ or â€oePoisonous Peanut Butterâ€?).Â  And for whatever reason, all the cows from the field across the street from your house were everywhere and they were big and colorful (red, yellow, blue, purple!) and robotic and they were mooing loudly and spraying milk everywhere and it was like a scary fun house. I felt weird because I knew that I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t belong thereâ€"I felt like a spy, an infiltrator, and an outcast.Â  I was getting nearer to your house and there was mist, fog, everywhere even though there was lots of sun.Â  I knew I looked suspicious riding that childrenâ€<sup>TM</sup>s bike, and I kept telling myself that if I was questioned, I would just say that I â€oegot lost,â€ or that I was just riding through the neighborhood by accidental childhood habit.Â  And then, there I was, in front of your house, and you were coming out of the front door and walking to the car, and you saw me and looked away and covered your face like those criminals who donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to be photographed.Â  It was you, but it wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t: you were very tall and thin, and your hair was short and pixie-ish.Â  Toni and Tom saw me and immediately started yelling at me and questioning me, trying to distract me from watching you get into the car and disappear.Â  They looked like they were made out of plastic.Â   And although you had disappeared into the car, I seemed to be able to see you on the other side of a screen/window/partition.Â  Your image seemed to be projected, and it hovered and flickered, catching my eye, pulling my attention away from the admonishments of your parents. We were standing on the lawnâ€"and yet we were inside the house somehowâ€"except there was no roof and the walls were not connected and there was an unusual amount of glaring sunlight: colors were pale and washed out, and the defining edges of everything seemed to be blurred into a halo of light.Â  Your robotic parents were talking, but I could barely hear themâ€"I was too busy trying to look at you.Â  By the time you had walked by, the only sound was a kind of deep humming noise. And then it just ended.Â  It stopped.Â  No more.Â  I was sad that the dream was over, and yet I was grateful.Â  I was pained to see you and not be able to touch you and talk with you.Â  And yet I was overjoyed to have had a brief glimpse of you.Â  But, overall, I am now confused.Â  Confused that you are still haunting me.Â  I believe that dreams are â€oereal,â€ that they are mediums for the subconscious, a connection to another â€oeworld.â€Â  I feel that you are trying to reach me in some way, that you are thinking about me, that you know that I am thinking about you.Â  We are still connected, Ducky.Â  I want to believe that we are still connected. I want to believe that you can feel my love for you even though we havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t seen each other for eight years.

Â  Friday, April 20, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  4:04 PM Dear Ducky,  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am back on the bus again.Â  I have so much to say and today I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t say anything.Â  I couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t sleep last night. I tried to tell Matt about this letterâ€"at Â first I wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t going to because I was just too upset for letting myself write this muchâ€"and then I realized that the feeling inside me was just too big, and if it was going to be able to come out at all, I would have to let him know. He has to know how much you mean to me. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am angry that I just canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t call you up and talk to you right now.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think you and I ever had many telephone conversationsâ€"we were too young to say anything other than, â€oeHey, wanna come over and play?â€Â  Real phone conversations didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t start until junior high and only got really good and juicy in high school.Â  You were already gone by then.Â  Would I even know your voice now?Â  I would probably be expecting a child voice, just as I am expecting a child face.Â  I am trying to remember what you sounded like saying my nameâ€"but Â I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t. Â I seem to recall that you had a slight gurgle in your voice, but that canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be right.Â  I do remember, however, your thick, coarse, black hair; how there was just so much of it, and it smelled warm, like slate.Â  My hair is always brown, sticky, and horribly short in all of my memories.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know how reliable memory smells are.Â  The girl I tried unsuccessfully to replace you with swore to me at one time that she remembers me smelling of orange mint when I was in the second grade.Â  I wish it were you who had remembered that.Â  Oh God, why did you have to go away?Â  Why couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t we have grown apart normally like childhood chums do?Â  Why couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t we have tried to steal each otherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s boyfriends and then hated each other?Â  Why do I have to miss you now when I havenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t played Barbies with you in ten years? Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  You should see the Barbies they have now Ducky.Â  There are too many kinds of Barbies now to keep up with.Â  Thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s basically a Barbie for every ethnicity and profession.Â  Thereâ€<sup>TM</sup>s even a Harley-Davidson Barbie.Â  And her clothes are worse than when we were kids: much sexier and revealing than before.Â  And our parents didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want us to play with Barbies because they would give us a bad model of self-image.Â  Barbie even has her own airplane and VW Beetle.Â  Oh, itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s awful.Â  You and I had to hide our lame Ballet Barbies from our parents.Â  We had to secretly buy them with our allowance money. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€¦Allowanceâ€¦remember when we would get one dollar a week and we would go to the Candyland store across the street from my house and then come home with little blue plastic bags of goodies?Â  I remember it was ten cents for those yummy candy sticks, so we could get ten each.Â  Watermelon was the best flavor of all!Â  I can still see it: bright green with tiny red and white stripes!Â  I can smell it! I can taste it! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I remember too the bubble gum cigarettes; how cool we thought we looked blowing out the powdered sugar, how sophisticated, how chic.Â  And there were the push-pops and ring-pops, candy necklaces and War-Heads. I remember rolling up socks and tying our shirts so that we could pretend that we had breasts, the ultimate dream of a pre-pubescent girl.Â  Everything about us seemed so grown up when out shirts would bulge like that.Â  We had to hide in your walk-in closet so that your mom wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t see what we were up to, and the one time she found us in there, with those lumps, she was horrified that we would ever want such â€oethingsâ€ and that we shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t be pretending at such a young age.Â  Maybe I pretended too much, too hard.Â  I have more breasts now than can barely fit in a shirt.Â  Do you remember when we did the opera Hansel and Gretel and we were gingerbread children?Â  Do you remember how we would get dressed together in the bathroom of the Community Center?Â  Some of the older girls scolded me for not wearing a bra yet.Â  I was in the fourth grade and already had breasts bigger than most of them.Â  Do you remember me growing before everyone else?Â  I realize I must have even gotten my period long before you.Â  But then I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t remember us ever talking about that type of thing.Â  Boobs yes, menstruation no. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I do remember us watching the Anne of Green Gables movies and squealing together about how gorgeous and wonderful Gilbert was, and we would fight and argue over who would get to marry him.Â  I always thought that I was the rebellious Anne and you were the beautiful, proper Diana, and that I was always corrupting you and getting you into trouble.Â  I always thought your parents hated me, especially Toni.Â  I was afraid of your mother.Â  She was constantly correcting the way I talked, the way I walked, the way I ate, the way I sat.Â  I was never good enough for you.Â  I used to cry about it.Â  I cried a lot.Â  And I was tired of everyone always reminding me about the stupid soup story:Â  how four-year-old Sara wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t eat her soup while dining at the Kuhrey-Haeuser house, and was reprimanded by having to sit at the kitchen table for hours, and she still refused to eat it because it was now â€oetoo cold.â€Â  It was humiliating how your parents and your brother would laugh about it: how I was undisciplined, uncouth, and a blight on my parentsâ€<sup>TM</sup> name.Â  My parents never tried to discipline you, did they, Ducky?Â  I want to think that maybe coming over to my house was a kind of escape for youâ€"that you could just be yourself and not have to worry about being quiet and proper and perfect. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I was a good friend to you, wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t I?Â  I know that you stopped seeking me out for secrets and suchâ€¦but I hope it wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t because I had in anyway betrayed your trust.Â  I wonder often why you didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t tell me what was going on.Â  The fact that you didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t makes me doubt the value of my friendship to you.Â  Did anyone else know what was really going on?Â  Who did you tell and why?Â  Who were your friends?Â  Why could you tell them and not me?Â  Was I really that naÃ¯ve?Â  I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t really think of myself that way after all of the things that I have experiencedâ€"and yet I know that I was innocent enough (or had the appearance of innocence enough) to give you the impression that you couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t confide in me and trust in me.Â  I wonder if everything that you told me as a child was a lie?Â  Were you friends with me only because our parents forced us to play with each other at the age of four?Â  Maybe I never confided in you either, maybe we both made the same mistake.Â  And your birthdayâ€"January 17thâ€"is that really even your birthday?Â  Are you really one year younger than me, or could you possibly be older, or even the same exact age?Â  Maybe your birthday is really in July, or September.Â  Everything could be different.Â  (Although thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not fair, since you were adopted, and we know that it was an arbitrary birth date.)  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I want to tell you all about what happened to me during adolescence, and yet I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want you to think that I am trying to make your struggle seem less horrific or hard.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to invalidate your experiences.Â  I want to know every single sordid detail about what happened to you: I want the blood, the sweat, and the tears.Â  I want you to know that I still love youâ€"that I will always love youâ€"that I love you even more for what you have been through.Â  I want us to share our hurt, our suffering, our pain.Â  I want you to know that I have been hurt too.Â  I want you to know that your only mistake was not letting me go through it with you.Â  And yet I know that you have been through too much, and that to you I will represent childhood in Sonoma, I will be what you need to keep running from.Â  I know that by wanting to know what happened to you, and by wanting to be a part of your life that I am asking for the impossible: I want what you cannot give, I want our childhood backâ€"I want the worst thing for you.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I myself have had a hard time even thinking about Sonoma.Â  I have to block out several years just to be able to think â€oegood things.â€Â  Maybe I want to distance myself so much from my past that with hindsight it all seems worse.Â  When I think about adolescence Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m not sure whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s real and whatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s a painful dream anymore. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am tired of running.Â  You must be too.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to stop running and head back to where I was, but I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t think I really need as much distance as I have created.Â  I think I am ready to accept the past for what lessons it has taught me.Â  That doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t mean that itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not painful to think about.Â  It just means that I maybe wonâ€<sup>TM</sup>t hate myself so much for experiencing it.

Â  Thursday, April 19, 2001Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9:15AM Dear Ducky, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There are so many things that I want to say to youâ€¦I am on the bus right now, on my way to school, and my throat hurts.Â  My throat hurts because of you.Â  Because I miss you.Â  I have started this letter so many timesâ€"it is years overdue.Â  My throat hurts because I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know where you areâ€"and because I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t write to you when I did know.Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s been yearsâ€¦almost fourâ€¦since I received that letter from youâ€"the letter that sounded like you but wasnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t.Â  Or maybe it really was you for the first time ever.Â  My throat hurts because the older I get, the more you are all I can remember from being young.Â  My throat hurts because I am afraid that when you never got a letter back from me, you forgot about me forever.Â  I secretly wish that I was the only one that you wrote toâ€"that I was the only one you could tellâ€"and I know how selfish that sounds.Â  I was envious all through childhood of the friends you had at St. Francis de Solano, they got to see you all day, every day. Â I was reserved for weekends.Â  I hated not being able to go the same school as you.Â  My throat hurts because I wonder if they were even good to youâ€"were they good friends?Â  Did they love you as much as I did? I realize that you know absolutely nothing about me since even before you ran away the first time.Â  You had thought that I was so wholesomeâ€"but I could share a few of my nightmares with you.Â  I think, arrogantly, that I had many experiences similar to yours.Â  I want desperately to tell you about them, but I have been told time and time again that I talk too much and donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t listen enough.Â  But there is so much to say!Â  There is eight years of catching up to do!Â  I console myself by saying that you need to know everythingâ€"that by knowing about me, I can somehow help you.Â  Do you even need help anymore?Â  I am afraid to ask certain questionsâ€"I am afraid of upsetting youâ€"and then I realize that when I think about you, I am thinking both of the way you looked the last time I saw you (you were fifteen or sixteen?), and then I am mostly thinking of a child Duk Sook: when you were seven, eight, maybe even as old as twelve.Â  And if I had asked you these questions as a child, you would have been furious (I think).Â  Do I really know anything about you?Â  I feel that I should, since we have known each other since we were four years old.Â  Or was everything from when we were kids a faÃ§ade?Â  I am angry with you for leaving me.Â  You were supposed to be the one I depended on, you were supposed to depend on me.Â  And you didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t.Â  You walked out.Â  I wonder how many of my experiences occurred because of your absence.Â  How maybe I kept trying to fill the void that you had created, trying to have other friends that were like you, and then only ended up hurting myself in the process.Â  No one could replace you, even though I wanted them to.Â  The girl I tried to replace you with betrayed and hurt me worse than you did.Â  I have since been afraid of woman and the way they seem to dupe me time and again. * * * There is a little Asian woman who is at my second bus stop every morning.Â  She is small, and old and wrinkled, and moves with such precision and grace and curiosity.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know her.Â  But I want to imagine that she is your grandmother.Â  That she holds you in her arms and serves you tea.Â  That she brushes your hair and braids it and serves you platters of meaningful food.Â  She teaches you all about Korea.Â  She makes you proud to be who you are.Â  She fixes your hurts and makes it okay for you to also be American. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am imagining that your adoptive parents, Toni and Tom, were cruel to you, that you were treated like a Cinderella-slave-girl.Â  I am very angry at themâ€"at the quiet, immaculate house, the precision, the fear of germs, the never-ending rolls of toilet paper for sneezes, how incompatible it seemed with children.Â  I am blaming your lack of exposure to G.I. Joe and Smurf cartoons.Â  I am thinking not enough TV and not enough candy.Â  Not enough laughing and not enough cuddling.Â  Not enough talking and not enough of the right type of arguing.Â  Not enough dress-up dolls, and not enough of what you wanted.Â  I still believe you never wanted to dance and never wanted to play the violin.Â  If she hadnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t already scared it out of you, Toni would have straightened your voice out too. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  What did she think was wrong with you?Â  I thought you were perfect.Â  I thought every word that came out of your mouth was funny and right.Â  Except when you gave me back that best-friend necklace because Toni said that you werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t allowed to have just one best friend.Â  That was the worst thing you ever told me.Â  You broke my heart.Â  Did your â€oemotherâ€<sup>TM</sup>sâ€ words break your heart too, because you were forced to turn me away?Â  Or were you already pulling yourself away and believed your motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s lies? Â DAMN!!Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s so easy to write â€oeyour motherâ€, but I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know if I believe that she really is your mother.Â  Do you still talk to Toni and Tom?Â  Do you love them?Â  Or do you resent them?Â  Do you have anyone whom you can call family?Â  I have heard rumors that you are living in Nebraska with cousins, aunts and uncles from Toniâ€<sup>TM</sup>s side.Â  Do you love them?Â  Or do you hate them because they donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have your blood?Â  Will you ever love anyone? Ã I am now positive that your â€oemotherâ€<sup>TM</sup>sâ€ refusal to let you be â€oebest friendsâ€ with me had a tremendous effect on the road that you went down.Â  I want to think that our forced separation, your lack of me, made it impossible for you to function: that you needed me so much that you shut down without me. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If you are in Nebraska, what is it like?Â  How does it compare to California?Â  To Sonoma?Â  There must not be a lot of hills.Â  This would bother me.Â  I would never be able to get used to that.Â  I wouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t feel safe.Â  I need hills; growing up in Sonoma Valley made them a necessary part of my life.Â  Do you feel the same way?Â  I want you to, since you grew up next to one of the most beautiful hills in Sonoma. * * * Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sometimes itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s as if you are dead.Â  And then I realize that I am mourning for you as if you really are.Â  I think I know deep down that I will never see you again.Â  Or else I am not allowing myself to hope against hope that I will see you again.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to set myself up for another failure.Â  I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t want to wish for you and then lose you all over again.Â  Thatâ€<sup>TM</sup>s why my throat hurtsâ€"because I am still waiting for your funeral.Â  Because one day you were there, and the next you werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t.Â  All I got was a letter while I was away at adventure/survival camp just after I had turned sixteen.Â  A small envelope with the desperate words of my mother:Â  â€oeSay a prayer for Ducky.Â  She has run away.â€Â  That was all I got: the only announcement of our separation.Â  They were strange, unfriendly words on peach stationary, trying to hide behind my motherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s small, beautiful scriptâ€"harsh words that made my eyes blink over and over.Â  Even though I thought I had given up God and prayer, I prayed for you every single night that I was at campâ€"when I was backpacking thirty miles to the ocean, when I was huddled alone next to the Eel River in the middle of the night.Â  I never stopped wondering where you were, where you had gone off to, what possibly had gotten into your head.Â  This was years before I got your letter explaining it all, and I had no idea what was going on.Â  It was as if my eight-year-old best friend has run away without reason.Â  I have only seen you once since then, that brief morning at St. Leoâ€<sup>TM</sup>s Church, where I had you again for less than an hour, where I held you tight and cried with gratitude that I had found you.Â  I cried too muchâ€"my Â tears blurred you and washed you away; so far away I have no idea where you are now.Â  I didnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know my tears were quite so powerful.Â  I shouldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t have cried so much.Â  I hate you for being so fragile that you let yourself be washed away.Â  I love you for trying to save yourself, for knowing that you had to get out. 6:07 PM Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am back on the bus, now on my way home after school.Â  I have been writing to you all day.Â  I have barely paid attention in class because of you.Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s funnyâ€"you affect my life even though you donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t exist anymore. Â I wonder if you have gone to college, if you are in college right now, or if you have lost too many precious years.Â Â 

Â  February 17, 2000 Dream:Â  Duk Sook and I, about seven, eight years oldÃ how we are kept apart by her parents.Â  In the first part I am forced to run many miles.Â  I run continuously through a park with lots of redwood trees and as I run through, I see Duk Sook, clinging to a tree, crying for me.Â  It happens in flashes, as if lit by lightning.Â  It happens over and over again, where I have to run past her and see her crying.Â  No one will comfort her.Â  It is her mother who is making me run past Duk Sook.Â  I want to save her, to take her in my arms, but I am too young, too small, and I canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t.Â  The other part is where I have to watch her being put to bed and tied down.Â  She is miserable all the time.Â  I can only watch.Â  Duk Sook and the redwoods and shadows.Â  Why canâ€<sup>TM</sup>t I even touch her?Â  She seems so near and yet so far.Â  It almost hurts to look at her.Â  No sounds except for the faint echoes of crying.Â  â€oeFlashbacksâ€ of us playing together, dressing up, playacting.Â  Growing up together and yet apart.Â  Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s as if we are twins, sisters, who cannot live without each other.Â  We feel connected always.Â  All of this is more painful because I may never actually see her again.Â Â 

Â  September 16, 1997 Dearest Duk Sook, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There are so many things that I want to tell you, so many thoughts that I want to share with you, but I donâ€<sup>TM</sup>t know where to begin.Â  I was more than a little surprised to receive a letter from you, but I was also greatly pleased. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Your letter greatly moved me, and touched my heart in a manner that I have been searching for for quite some time.Â  To say that I cried would be an understatement.Â  I shed tears of joy, happiness, understanding, frustration, compassion, sympathy, empathyâ€¦and the list goes on.Â  To finally hear your story in your own words, by your own desire was an honor.Â  To tell you the truth, I was taken aback by how much of your experience finally made clear, understandable and tangible a lot of the confusion and emptiness in my own life.Â  I have lived the past few years with no solid knowledge of why you suddenly disappeared from my life.Â  You were my dearest, truest friend.Â  And then, quite literally, one day you were gone, and I was left alone, hurt, and full of questions and fears.Â  I had originally thought that we became separated by the natural course of adolescent lifeâ€"I went down one path and you another, all the while thinking, guessing, that your journey was parallel to my own, although perhaps not entirely similar.Â  I was naÃ¯ve and ignorant of the truth, and, with hindsight, I am ashamed of my blindness.Â  I told myself a million times after reading your letter that, had I been a better friend to you, been more aware and alert to warning signs I now realize that you displayed, perhaps I could have somehow prevented you from being in danger and experiencing countless heartaches.Â   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  My own tales of occurrences during our childhood and teenage years would surprise you.Â  I actually traveled down the same nightmarish road as you did my dear, only later, and I was blessed enough to have been rescued before there was no hope left and no going back.Â  This again leads me to almost say that I could have helped you, but looking back, I know that we were both too scared of what the other might say, think, or do to genuinely reach out and admit that we endured profound struggles. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Since receiving your letter, my mind has been on fire with recollections of the past: pictures, images of you and I at various stages of our young lives, involved in pertinent dreams and emotional upheavals.Â  The outpouring of memories from my brain overwhelms me; I am racing to find value and meaning for them all, in order to fully explain to you, my dear, sweet Duk Sook, my understanding of who you are, and of who I am as well.Â  But something else must be said firstâ€"I need to tell you (and I think that you probably need to hear this) that I love you, wholly and unconditionally.

She was buried in a cornfield.  Well, not actually  in  the corn, but in an odd little plot of green grass somewhere in the middle of the crop.  She had a headstone, as did the others who rested with her.  As everyone belonged to the same family, there was no need for the stones to compete with ornate  statues or profound epitaphs.  Each one was just like the next: plain, simple, to the point.  Flowery sentiments weren't meant for the grave--they should be used when speaking memories only.  Her tombstone was a few rows in, as she wasn't the most recent.  The grayish rock marking her bones simply said this: "Mary Studer 1928-1946."  Only eighteen years old.  That was the way it was.  She born in a bed, and buried in the corn.   Mary Elizabeth Studer was fifty before she knew about her grave.  By then she had carried around an additional name, Shea, for some twenty-seven years.  So even though she was now mostly known as Mary Shea, there was no mistaking her name on the headstone as her own.  Except the dates were completely wrong: all well before she was born.  And why in the world had she already been tucked away in the ground?  Rather, why had a place been prepared at all?  The smudged picture on the fax paper was tiled at a 45-degree angle.  Someone had been in a hurry to put it all together.  But when Mary looked at the tilted grave, the slant was just the same as the tilt in her throat.  The angle stopped mattering.  Soon she didn't even notice, and focused on other things.  She was disappointed the photo wasn't in color.  This was not so that the gray stone would be a more vibrant gray.  She wanted to see the green texture of the grass, imagine how it felt on bare feet.  Soft, or coarse?  What about the blue of the sky that was being pushed out of the corner?  And the yellow-green of the cornstalks that were lined up in back.  These were the colors she imagined she could smell.  She had never been to Iowa.  Mary had never spent much time in cemetaries, either.  She avoided them as often as possible, mostly because something inside of her would start to feel heavy and cold.  Something somewhere in the vicinity of her liver.  Or her kidney.  She'd never been very good at anatomy.  As a child she often woke to find her head throbbing and certain that she had just stopped screaming.  It had been so real.  She almost didn't want to believe it had been a dream--that would have justified her fear.  She could never quite remember what she had seen in her sleep--the throbbing in her head quickly erased any real retention.  She did remember that somewhere she had heard, or read, about bodies that were dug up, usually because the family couldn't continue to pay for the plot.  The position of the hands of the deceased were markedly different than the way they had traditionally been placed by the undertaker.  They were raised above their chests, palms facing out, the fingers bent as if they were trying to make a fist, or had been clawing at some unseen spectre.  All of the mouths were gaped open, the shape of a long, capital "O".  The repeated discovery of bodies in this same pose prompted coroners to let the deceased "lay in wait" for no less than three days, just to be sure.  Mary was terrified of being buried alive all the same.  She was not thrilled to see what her grave looked like.  The sight of the letters that were carved there made her feel odd.

When you make an appointment to look at an apartment, you expect the landlord to be a little quirky.  You won't blink if the person who answers the phone sounds like a former KGB agent and is named Vladimir.  However, when Vladimir tells you that he may be late to meet you because he will be riding his bike, that might be a sign that this particular apartment is not for you.  But you arrive anyway, after needing to get your car battery jumped in a Safeway parking lot.  You are a serious applicant, mind you.  But please, when you see that Vladimir is tall and lanky, with a porn star mustache and is wearing spandex bicycle shorts (complete with horrid bulge), and you are still across the street,   TURN AROUND AND HEAD BACK TO THE CAR WITHOUT A WORD.    He won't know it was you.  And besides, you already left him a message that your car was in need of AAA assistance.  It is your own damn fault if you greet him, and have to witness him dragging his bike into the building, and then view a disgusting apartment that hasn't even really been vacated yet, and get a single finger on your palm when you attempt to shake hands.  As you are an advocate of a firm handshake, that last point alone would void any further interaction.  So no whining to your friends and begging for sympathy.  You had your chance, and you blew it.

But they keep disappearing like they are. I can never keep track of my freaking music. Are there CD-gnomes somewhere that love my eclectic selection? I know I am the only one here who listens to this stuff, so where in the blue blazes is it all??

This is true. I am money. As in I consume it. Much too fast. I am not really conscious about how much everything costs. Money makes me cranky. Like tonight. How come I am never able to budget anything? Or is it simply because I am making crap wages? Which leads me to ask: How long will that continue? Will I always be making just enough to keep our heads above water? $$$ does not make you happy. But not having $$$ definitely makes you unhappy. So what is the "happy" medium?

The French Ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte, is here in the museum.  He is being given a private tour of the Van Gogh to Mondrian exhibit.  I find this very exciting, especially since it is being done without a lot of fanfare or stress.  I wonder if he would even be here if it weren't for Van Gogh.  What does he think of Seattle?  Why is he even up here in the Pacific Northwest anyway?

Earlier today I was thinking about what pieces I used to be able to play on the piano, in response to the main character in my best friend Jill's novel, who is a pianist.  My favorite was "Moonlight Sonata", which was simple and yet soulful.  This reminded me of the mystery surrounding Ludwig von Beethoven and the letters found after his death.  My father told me the strange story of Beethoven's anonymous love when I was a little girl, and read me the letters out of a big blue book.  Then there was a movie in 1994, I think, with Gary Oldman, which was a speculation about the possible identities of the woman who is never named.  Was the movie any good?  I don't remember.  I do recall that the soundtrack was amazing (of course), and that I did enjoy the discussions that the movie prompted afterwards.  I think I also went and found the big blue book, and spent several days copying down what I considered to be some of the most romantic letters I had ever read.  So here are the letters.   IMMORTAL BELOVED    The First Letter     July 6, in the morning My angel, my all, my very self - Only a few words today and at that with pencil (with yours) - Not till tomorrow will my lodgings be definitely determined upon - what a useless waste of time - Why this deep sorrow when necessity speaks - can our love endure except through sacrifices, through not demanding everything from one another; can you change the fact that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine - Oh God, look out into the beauties of nature and comfort your heart with that which must be - Love demands everything and that very justly - thus it is to me with you, and to your with me. But you forget so easily that I must live for me and for you; if we were wholly united you would feel the pain of it as little as I - My journey was a fearful one; I did not reach here until 4 o'clock yesterday morning. Lacking horses the post-coach chose another route, but what an awful one; at the stage before the last I was warned not to travel at night; I was made fearful of a forest, but that only made me the more eager - and I was wrong. The coach must needs break down on the wretched road, a bottomless mud road. Without such postilions as I had with me I should have remained stuck in the road. Esterhazy, traveling the usual road here, had the same fate with eight horses that I had with four - Yet I got some pleasure out of it, as I always do when I successfully overcome difficulties - Now a quick change to things internal from things external. We shall surely see each other soon; moreover, today I cannot share with you the thoughts I have had during these last few days touching my own life - If our hearts were always close together, I would have none of these. My heart is full of so many things to say to you - ah - there are moments when I feel that speech amounts to nothing at all - Cheer up - remain my true, my only treasure, my all as I am yours. The gods must send us the rest, what for us must and shall be -  Your faithful LUDWIG.    The Second Letter     Evening, Monday, July 6 You are suffering, my dearest creature - only now have I learned that letters must be posted very early in the morning on Mondays to Thursdays - the only days on which the mail-coach goes from here to K. - You are suffering - Ah, wherever I am, there you are also - I will arrange it with you and me that I can live with you. What a life!!! thus!!! without you - pursued by the goodness of mankind hither and thither - which I as little want to deserve as I deserve it - Humility of man towards man - it pains me - and when I consider myself in relation to the universe, what am I and what is He - whom we call the greatest - and yet - herein lies the divine in man - I weep when I reflect that you will probably not receive the first report from me until Saturday - Much as you love me - I love you more - But do not ever conceal yourself from me - good night - As I am taking the baths I must go to bed - Oh God - so near! so far! Is not our love truly a heavenly structure, and also as firm as the vault of heaven?    The Third Letter     Good morning, on July 7 Though still in bed, my thoughts go out to you, my Immortal Beloved, now and then joyfully, then sadly, waiting to learn whether or not fate will hear us - I can live only wholly with you or not at all - Yes, I am resolved to wander so long away from you until I can fly to your arms and say that I am really at home with you, and can send my soul enwrapped in you into the land of spirits - Yes, unhappily it must be so - You will be the more contained since you know my fidelity to you. No one else can ever possess my heart - never - never - Oh God, why must one be parted from one whom one so loves. And yet my life in V is now a wretched life - Your love makes me at once the happiest and the unhappiest of men - At my age I need a steady, quiet life - can that be so in our connection? My angel, I have just been told that the mailcoach goes every day - therefore I must close at once so that you may receive the letter at once - Be calm, only by a calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together - Be calm - love me - today - yesterday - what tearful longings for you - you - you - my life - my all - farewell. Oh continue to love me - never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. ever thine ever mine ever ours

Dear Ducky  Dear Ducky, Salutations from Suffering Sara. Happy Absence Anniversary! Count the calendar: eight endless years. Dating death yet? I fear future funerals, so I munch on memories, recalling roles, missing magic. What wretched words these are. Requesting your return. Sincerely, Sentimental Sara

Desperately Seekingâ€¦  Lost: One best friend. Name: Duk Sook, prefers â€oeDucky.â€ Ran away 10 yrs ago, while I was @ camp. No goodbyes had. Remember when we were 5 & 1st met? Or yrs later playing â€oedress-upâ€ and stuffing our bras? Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>m sorry you grew up too fast, & I, @ 15, couldnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t help you. I still love you. Wondering where you are keeps me up @ night, Even after a decade.

Ash Wednesday  Thursday the first day of March in the year of our Lord two thousand and â€"oneâ€": there are flowers here that werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t here the day before yesterday. Itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s the first day of Lent, and the flowers have grown. Something happened yesterday. It was Wednesday. Ash Wednesday. The day of the earthquake. These flowers werenâ€<sup>TM</sup>t here on Tuesday. They were pushed out of the ground early: expelled by jolts, waves of agony: here purple crocuses butter daffodils tiny violets blinking in the weak sunlight. Trees, too soft pink blooms stretching as if shaken from slumber. First day of spring overnight no dress rehearsal just cold script reading. Spring on the way summer soon after. Who forced the shake? Who was anxious for flowers?

    You can Dere-lick my balls.Â  

    People always tell me they admire my enthusiasm...Â  

    I love nature.  And being on Frat Row.  And getting my picture taken.Â  

    My two favorite boys, BooBoo and Matt!Â  

    No spinach needed.Â  

    Those Shea kids can dance!Â  

    Timothy Magnus, my awesome younger brother, and me at the Ballard Locks in April 2004--his first visit up here since joining the Army RangersÂ  

    Me writing in New OrleansÂ        I don't know if I have quite figured out this whole picture thing yet.  I suppose that this worked...

So I work in a museum. The Seattle Art Museum. I love it. My co-workers are awesome. My bosses (plural) are also pretty nifty. Previously, SAM wasn't exactly what I would call...um, world-class. But currently we have an exhibit visiting from the Kroller-Muller Museum in the Netherlands: "Van Gogh to Mondrian."  We are one of only two museums in the U.S. who get this exhibit, the other being the High Museum in Atlanta.  Kroller-Muller (sorry for the lack of relevant punctuation) is a museum created from the private collection of Helene Kroller-Muller, who had the largest private collection of Vincent Van Gogh's work in the entire world.  Apparently she managed to get upwards of 80+ of his drawings at one time.  Cool stuff.  And the main reason I am working here, as Van Gogh is my favoritest.  I've travelled far to see his work: Boston, Los Angeles, Paris...Lots of other people are very excited to actually have something of this magnitude in Seattle.  Which is fine.  However, here at the membership desk, I am running into a lot of people who will seemingly say ANYTHING in order to try and get in for free.  Is this because they are poor, and the prices ($15) are too high, and they really just want to appreciate art?  Or is it because they don't care that they are LYING, and would do the same thing in order to see ANYTHING for free?!  AUGH!  I really shouldn't even attempt to go into the bullshit that I am submitted to.  Let's just say that I know our admissions/membership policy up and down.  And the people who try to give me a line are usually our very own museum members!  Who are already getting in free!  And somehow they think that anybody they happen to be associated with ALSO gets in free.  And my thought is, we need people to buy memberships and tickets in order to keep the museum going.  That is why these people bought these memberships in the first place.  Do they really want to deny the museum much needed revenue?!  I don't understand the evil intentions of the public.  It really chaps my hide.  I would never even conceive of doing this type of thing myself.

Today more than ever I am shocked by what is coming to a theater near you.  And on top of that, there is a gaping, obvious contrast between two releases in particular today.  Yes, you guessed correctly:   Fahrenheit 9/11   and   White Chicks  .  Now, it's not necessarily that Michael Moore is infallible and comparing anything to his work is going to invariably make him shine with a holy light or anything like that.  It's mostly that the new Wayans movie is so god-awful that anything in it's proximity looks like a cinematic masterpiece.  Have I seen either flick?  Um, no.  Not yet.  Well, for the Wayans, probably never.  Ever.  Unless I secretly rent it once it comes out on video.  But I would never ever admit to it.  Or ever ever enjoy it.    EVER.    So why am I bitching?  The first time I saw a preview for White Chicks I was horrified.  I remember turning to Matt and just letting my jaw drop.  I was embarrassed for Marlon and Shawn--the thought that they ACTUALLY considered doing a picture like this...The next time I saw the preview, the audience was laughing and hooting...with   excitement  .  I still felt sick to my stomach looking at the Mrs. Doubtfire get-up--but I will take hairy crazy Robin Williams in a fat suit anyday over those disgusting, pasty, monstrosities.  Has anybody who's interested in this movie actually taken the time to LOOK at the creepy makeup job?  Yes,   CREEPY  .  These two beautiful men look like evil Barbie doll rejects.  Or evil robots.  With evil evil skin and lips and eyes.  Makes me cringe. Yuck Yuck Yuck!  So compare that to   Fahrenheit 9/11  , which is a documentary about stuff that George Bush and the nation did after the WTC tragedy. There is no comparison.  It's gross.  Now, it's a well known fact that I will do a jig of joy when Bush is finally gone from D.C.  But I promise you that I am not biased.  Nope, not at all.  I really am freaked out by this White Chicks movie.  It's like   Soul Man   in reverse.  Blah.

Just got the good word that I have been readmitted to Seattle University.  WHOOHOO!  I don't know why I was stressed out that they might not take me back--after all, my GPA is almost flawless.  But it was a concern nonetheless.  I am looking forward to being a student again, even though I'm not sure what it will be like to return even OLDER than I already was.  And will I be able to concentrate even?  Well, I have to.  There is no alternative.  I just need to get my undergrad degree so I can move on with my life.  Focus on writing, and loving, and just living each and every day.  Have to come back to this later...

...Of really actually doing this. Let's see if this works. It may be a complete disaster. I am a big pussy about trying new things. I would like to be able to think of myself as "spontaneous" and "unpredictable", but sadly that's not really the case. I am such an stubborn old lady sometimes, which is bizarre, as I feel like a complete child in relation to the world. Why am I doing this? Well, I am at work at the Seattle Art Museum right now. It is very slow. I get to play online when it's slow. Which is a lot. So this is something new to distract myself with. Because that way I won't check my email 500 times every half an hour.   Maybe. I am actually surprised how easy this is. Perhaps this is just because I am a more accomplished typist. And I am enjoying this... ...Because isn't this every writer's dream? To see their writing in print in public? But I don't want to focus on that aspect. I am doing this because it really is just the act of writing that I am interested in. Okay, but really, yes, I need to break the monotony of my job. Which I love. Because we have some Van Gogh! Which I haven't even been upstairs to see yet.  :( But I will! I swear! I promise! But I figure I have three months, so... Let us see how this turns out. Like I said, I am scared and excited. I'm covering my eyes with my hands. I'm not looking, I'm not peeking...

...right in front of the museum.Â  Zana and I were just talking about cars, and the pros/cons of automatic or manual transmission, and I saw through our huge front windows a man running at full speed, followed by two policemen who tackled him right under our admission line tent.Â  I went up to the doors and watched them handcuff the culprit, and a woman standing next to me was almost in tears because she thought the police were going to break his arm.Â  He was full-on struggling, so one of the policemen kept his knee in the guy's lower back.Â  It was way intense--they kept yelling: "You are under arrest!Â  You have the right to remain silent!Â  You are under arrest!"Â  After they pulled him to the squad car, I went outside to fix our stanshions, and they were still yelling.Â  The guy was protesting, and a plain-clothed policeman with his gun hanging off of hisÂ beltÂ was shouting, "My partner SAW you do it!Â  Why do you think we were chasing you?"Â  I have no idea what he was being arrested for, but it was more than obvious that he was resisting.Â  It's only 10:30 AM, and that may be the most exciting thing that will happen all day.Â  Except maybe the fact that it's 20 degress cooler than it has been the previous two days...

Just a quick note today... A gentleman just came and spent about twenty minutes talking to me and my co-worker about the kind of art he would like to see in the museum.Â  Seattle pales in comparison to many other museums, especially next to The Metropolitan Museum in New York.Â  He said that he is very good friends with a curator in Europe, and they want to do a kind of "trade" relationship.Â  Basically the period is twentieth century, but the work was done by artists who were hidden behind the Iron Curtain, so they are virtually unkown, even though they did pieces much like, say, Picasso.Â  I am totally and completely fascinated.Â  He said that bringing that stuff over here would be amazing, but equally awesome would be the opportunity to bring our Native-American and African art over there.Â  I don't know...I was pretty impressed...

Another excellent Frost piece.Â  This one feels especially relevant with current political events...    Fire and Ice    Some say the world will end in fire,  Some say in ice.  From what I've tasted of desire  I hold with those who favor fire.  But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To know that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.   --Robert Frost

This is one of my very favorite Frost poems...    The Road Not TakenÂ     Â Â   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry I could not travel both  And be one traveler, long I stood  And looked down one as far as I could  To where it bent in the undergrowth;Â   Then took the other, as just as fair,  And having perhaps the better claim,  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,Â   And both that morning equally lay  In leaves no step had trodden black.  Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back.Â   I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€"  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.Â    Â Â Â    --Robert Frost

MENDING WALL   Â Â    Something there is that doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t love a wall,  That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,  And spills the upper boulders in the sun;  And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.  The work of hunters is another thing:Â   I have come after them and made repair  Where they have left not one stone on a stone,  But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,  To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,  No one has seen them made or heard them made,Â   But at spring mending-time we find them there.  I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;  And on a day we meet to walk the line  And set the wall between us once again.  We keep the wall between us as we go.Â   To each the boulders that have fallen to each.  And some are loaves and some so nearly balls  We have to use a spell to make them balance:  â€oeStay where you are until our backs are turned!â€  We wear our fingers rough with handling them.Â   Oh, just another kind of out-door game,  One on a side. It comes to little more:  There where it is we do not need the wall:  He is all pine and I am apple orchard.  My apple trees will never get acrossÂ   And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.  He only says, â€oeGood fences make good neighbours.â€  Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder  If I could put a notion in his head:  â€oeWhy do they make good neighbours? Isnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t itÂ   Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.  Before I built a wall Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d ask to know  What I was walling in or walling out,  And to whom I was like to give offence.  Something there is that doesnâ€<sup>TM</sup>t love a wall,Â   That wants it down.â€ I could say â€oeElvesâ€ to him,  But itâ€<sup>TM</sup>s not elves exactly, and Iâ€<sup>TM</sup>d rather  He said it for himself. I see him there  Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top  In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.Â   He moves in darkness as it seems to me,  Not of woods only and the shade of trees.  He will not go behind his fatherâ€<sup>TM</sup>s saying,  And he likes having thought of it so well  He says again, â€oeGood fences make good neighbours.â€   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  --Robert Frost

One of the aspects about this blogging thing is that you can browse through other people's blogs.Â  How do I decide which ones to read?Â  Usually just the title ropes me in.Â  Sometimes the title isn't enough to cover up the crap that is contained therein, so I just stop reading and usually wonder why in the hell I bother.Â  But today I came across two that I found to be very interesting, mostly because they contained some hardcore political rants.Â  I was especially impressed with one of them, because it seems that the blogger only just graduated from high school, and is an astute philosopher and poet.Â  The other commented on the first, and I checked out his blog as well.Â  He is a doctor with the Army, and is currently stationed in Iraq.Â  We all know my feelings about that country and the soldiers (from any nation at all) over there.Â  So check these out.

So starting today, Seattle is hosting the annual governor's convention (I guess that's what it's called).Â  Most political events here are held in the Westin Hotel on Fifth Avenue (I prefer to call it Â The Corncob Hotel ).Â  But why not host these gatherings called conventions in the  Convention Center  which is only a few blocks away?Â  Are politicians just too... special  to enter a common convention center?Â  But surely the WSCC has rooms much more massive than the Westin could offer.Â  I refuse to believe that it's a security issue, either.Â  They could certainly have more security if they have control of a whole wing of a building rather than just a smallish room in a giant hotel.Â  My bus couldn't even travel down 5th, its usual route, when we got downtown.Â  How in the world is a local bus, full of regular Seattlites, a  threat? Â  And they are just governors.Â  They are not rock stars, or famed geniuses, or religious icons (at least not to me they aren't).Â  But as a nation, we certainly do regard our politicians with the same fervor that we muster up for say, oh, I want to say Madonna, but I don't want to be insulting.Â  To her.Â  So once again, everybody in town has their panties in a twist.Â  And the real news, of course, is that none other than Mrs. Theresa Heinz Kerry was here in the Van Gogh gallery this morning.Â  So French diplomats, the future First Lady of the United States (I hope), and apparently yesterday we had some members of the Japanese Parliment.Â  Whoohoo!Â  Our little museum is quite the destination for political dignitaries.Â  VP Dick Cheney has been to Seattle several times in the past year, but I seriously doubt that he would come to an  art  museum.Â 

Every Thursday night here at the museum, we feature free live music in the lobby.  Tonight it is "Hot Latin Jazz for a Summer Evening."  I have never worked the evening shift on a Thursday, so I am totally not prepared for this.  The music is great, and people are into it, but holey rusted metal batman, it is so LOUD!  My customers are getting angry with me because we can't hear each other talking.  Plus, it is so much harder to sell memberships over there.

Hey there. So we have one room open in a 3bd/1ba house 2 Â½ blocks from Greenlake open anytime after Feb 1st. We are looking for someone ideally something like this: A chill kid that is down with a little drinkin and smokin on the weekends (even a rare outdoor kegger) but who respects the need for quiet time (we usually go to bed around eleven or midnight during the week). Basically if you want to drink a ton go to the bars like I do. One who keeps communal living spaces clean (I mean the clean part), is responsible and respectful, and likes dogs, even the mean ones :) A student would be cool, as I am one myself. Below is more info about my other roommate and I, the house and the bills. ME: 21yo chill but very upbeat straight girl. I am a nanny fulltime and I will begin school in the fall at the UW as a junior majoring in Philosophy (assuming I can manage). I am really into snowboarding, writing, pool (conceivably the tightest game ever), hip hop reading, philosophy (my intended major), sewing (itÂ's not just for old ladies anymore), drinking, horseback riding, photography and on. I am clean, so is the house, so watch out cause if you leave your dishes in the sink I might eat you alive, although I could give a shit what your room looks like. Other than being anal about cleanliness I am mass laid back. I dig people, love going out, find arguments pleasing and like to laugh more than almost anything else. I am a eco-friendly, very open minded, terribly sarcastic, wonderfully positive, liberal, quasi-vegan girl that drinks way too much.SCOTTIE: 22yo straight boy. Scottie is a rad kid. He isnÂ't as big into as drinking as I am but he smokes like it is his job. He has about thirty friends named Jake and they are all mass respectful. He is also in to hip hop, anime, movies by good directors and, gulp, techno. He likes to argue much like I do which makes for some occasional late night debates. He is very laid back THE HOUSE: The house has w/d, basement with some storage, cable, wireless internet, huge fenced backyard, heaps of plants, a kitty, two mini turtles and a pup. The cat is ancient and lives in the basement for the most part. Her name is Spiffy (donÂ't ask) but Scottie and his friends recently renamed her Jonas Â"BasementÂ" Jones (again, donÂ't ask) whereas I prefer to call her Spliffy. He isnÂ't dangerous, just territorial. If you are straight with him, understand he is a little nuts, respect his space and pet him a whole bunch you will get along in time.BILLS: The rent is $450/mo. There is a month to month lease so you can bail when you need with notice, but of course I would prefer you have long-term plans to stay. You have to pay 1st and last up front. Monthly bills are (for each person) $10/mo for the phone, $20/mo for the cable/internet, an occasional $100+/- for oil (like 4 times a year), and on average maybe $70 every other month for utilities. It is cheaper in the spring and summer for obvious reasons. Take it easy. Lesley

How in the foosh can it already be July? I feel like I blinked and 30 days passed. Which they did, whether I blinked or not. But I'm not ready for 4th of July or any of that nonsense. Especially now that Tim's in the Army. I just don't have it in me.

I am continually amazed by the disrespect I receive as a customer-service provider.  Let me make a disclaimer: most of my customers (museum members) are absolutely wonderful, and we do nothing  but exchange happy smiles all day long.  But there have been a string of people who have gotten so angry at me because I won't break the rules, and therefore have berated me, and been increasingly rude.  AS IF BEING RUDE TO THE PERSON YOU WANT SOMETHING FROM WILL GET YOU BETTER, FASTER, NICER SERVICE.

Uh, yeah, it's been a while since I've written anything. What's been going on?  Well, work mostly.  Oh and I also moved last week...fifteen blocks from where I was before.  Which is great.  But I've been completely consumed with reading another blog, one called "My War: Fear and Loathing in Iraq", written by an infantryman stationed in Mosul.  It is absolutely riveting--it is blunt, sarcastic, funny, sentimental, intelligent, honest...I can't seem to tear myself away from it.  And I'm not the only one--so many other people check in everyday to see if he's written anything, and if he hasn't, everyone starts to get worried, myself included, since as of this post, he hasn't posted either.  It makes me feel a little more connected to my brother, Tim, by reading what it's "really like" over there.  I want everyone to read it:   http://cbftw.blogspot.com   It's absolutely amazing.
