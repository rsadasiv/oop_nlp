It is not really late, but I am so tired.  I wanted to sleep in this morning, but John had other ideas, as he usually does.  But he didn't get up too early, just at seven.  That's better than 5:45, which is what he does sometimes.  Being pregnant doesn't help.  Speaking of pregnant, this weather has been atrocious; it's been so hazy I can hardly breathe.  I've actually been high-headed sometimes when I've been outside.  So what have I been up to?  Well, we didn't do anything with Laura and Marcus the other day.  I guess Sunday went okay.  Bro. Cliff ended up telling me what the congregational songs were two Sundays ago, but he didn't this last Sunday.  Then he said that he tried to call and the phone was busy and he's right there.  I was receiving a crash course in HTML from Daniel and we were on the internet until about 3:45 that afternoon.  Oh well.   Tomorrow we are supposed to go eat dinner with Jeremy's boss, Joe.  When I say we I mean Jeremy, me and John, Phillip, Jamie and Sarah, John and Esther.  All of the men listed there work at NAPA and all of their families are coming too.  I wonder what we will eat.  I asked Susan (Joe's wife) if I could bring anything and she said no.  I hope John behaves!  He usually does. We will be having revival in two weeks: August 9-13.  Bro. Donnie Harvey is gonna preach.  That is good.  I like him.  But I think that he uses Just For Men!  That is all for now.  I have lots of funny John stories, but I am too tired!

Mood: happy / hungry    Hungry!  What's for lunch.  Chili and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Under normal circumstances I could  never  eat that much food at a time.  Pregnant people can achieve amazing feats!  Jeremy made me put rice in it.  Isn't that weird?  Rice in chili.  And cheese too.  When I eat chili, I want chili.   Sunday went better than expected.  I called Bro. Cliff to get the songs that would be sung during the morning service.  I have so much to do for next semester in Bible college.  I still have to edit the curriculum for New Testament History.  Blah!  And send out applications.  Blah!     Laura and Marcus want to get together Friday and cook out.  Sounds like fun to me.  There is a little boy in our church (8 months old) named Deyton.  He got his little hands burned on the stove yesterday.  He pulled up on the glass of the stove and ended up with second degree burns.  I saw his dad (Shaun) at NAPA today and he said that Deyton was gonna be fine.  They have to put a salve on his hands and wrap his hands up like a boxer!  Poor baby.  Bet it drives him nuts!   I like cantaloupe.  Someone out there needs to buy me DSL for at least a year.  Dial-up is so annoying, especially if you are trying to download something.  I am trying to update my antivirus software.  Blah!  Have a nice day.

Mood: hum drum    Another Saturday.  We typically go to Mom's on Saturday, but not today.  I have been telling her this all week.  So Saturday comes and I tell her (again) that we are not coming.  So why does she get mad about that?  We never get to bed until well after midnight when we go to Mom's.  Then we get up between 6:30 and 7 o' clock on Sunday to go to church.  Get me ready, iron Sunday clothes, get John ready, make breakfast.  It's a lot to do.  Especially when you are 7 months pregnant and have a 17 month old baby (not to mention a husband).  Oh well.  People cause stress.  I don't like stress.  I guess that is why Daniel always says, "I don't like people."   Making chili for supper.  Ya' know spices are a rip off.  They are so expensive and they don't last very long ...   I am dreading to play the piano tomorrow.  What is so hard about getting the congregational music picked out a little ahead of time.  I am not asking for much here, maybe 24 hours?  Nope.  All I get is 30 seconds to look over each song and then play it for worship service.  Are there any pianists out there?  How would you like to sight-read everything you played for someone?  I guess you can't teach an old song leader new tricks.  I will be glad that Jeremy will be conducting the music service for the next two Sundays after this one.  He doesn't like procrastination and neither do I.  Maybe that is why I love him?   I promise that I am not in a bad mood, although you can't tell from my post. :-)

Well, I really hope that I can get this web site to run the way I want it to.  Brother is little help.  He told me to ask Heather.  I don't have much to say.  Had a better day than yesterday.  Yesterday was from Satan.  Flooded houses are never fun...

Yep!  All alone.  Just me and my lunch.  I love Lay's KC Masterpiece BBQ potato chips.  I could eat the whole bag.  Jeremy took John to go work on the lawn mower ... a never-ending task, it seems.  John is getting sick, poor baby.  Just with a summer cold; but those things can be the worst.  He sure is ill.  Hopefully he will get over it soon.  They will be back soon, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to update my blog.  We are having revival services this week at church.  Bro. Donnie Harvey is preaching it.  Jeremy said that when he put the announcement on the church's marquee, he ran out of V's.  That is weird.  Running out of V's of all letters.  On both sides he put something like Revival with Evangelist Donnie Harvey.  He only had seven V's.  I really need to get a keyboard skin for my computer.  I saw one on eBay recently for only $2 plus shipping.  I thought that was a great deal, but I still didn't get it.  I just spilled a little water on the keyboard.  Oops!  Looks like Jeremy is gonna be leading the singing for a while.  Don't know what happened to Bro. Cliff.  But I do know that Preacher is pretty upset with him.  I don't ask, I just obey!  That suits me just fine.  Now I will get to actually practice for the selections for the song service.  That would be a plus.  We celebrated Granny Bessie's 80th birthday at Nichols Seafood last Saturday.  Any I lost an earring >:-(  That is so sad.  I loved those earrings.  And they were really expensive (for silver) and special.  I bought them to wear with my senior prom dress.  Now they are gone.  Oh well.  It's just a thing, right.  Okay, now I must needs go to finish this day.  Later!
