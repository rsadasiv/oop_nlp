We had our convocation this Sunday‚Ä¶ and now, I can officially call myself a post graduate‚Ä¶ well, I should‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve blogged this yesterday, but I am sure the fresh memories would remain fresh for days to come‚Ä¶ and one day wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t really make a difference‚Ä¶   The atmosphere was simply one of its kind‚Ä¶ for someone like me who has never experienced a convocation before (mine was one of those colleges that couriered our degree certificates home!!), it was excitement at its peak‚Ä¶ getting the degree itself was a thrilling moment‚Ä¶ and getting a medal was even better! With most of my thoughts focused on how I should avoid a fall with my saree, and some of them on how I shouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t turn away from the photographer making his life miserable‚Ä¶ it was great fun altogether‚Ä¶   The morning was filled with feel-good reunions happening‚Ä¶ Since we were meeting our batch-mates after more than six months, we were busy finding out who has put on weight‚Ä¶ and then getting tips from the lucky ones who have managed to lose a few pounds! And then meeting friends‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> families, about whom we would have heard a zillion anecdotes‚Ä¶ but coming face to face for the first time‚Ä¶   Meeting up with professors was even more thrilling‚Ä¶ one Prof remarked to my mom that he can‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t resist teasing me‚Ä¶ and was pulling my leg in the company of my parents! And our Director didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t miss his chance, and remarked that I looked like one more ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>mami‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in a sari! And that he took time to recognize me!  I am glad that my emotions did not take the better of me while in college‚Ä¶ but they did, when I reached home‚Ä¶ I was still sinking in the fact that 2 years had flewn by jus like that‚Ä¶ I could not think of anything else‚Ä¶ and I think it‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s quite natural‚Ä¶ all those good old days and good times‚Ä¶ my mind was bombarded with a million memories‚Ä¶ and cherishable moments‚Ä¶   Right from the intro sessions on day one‚Ä¶ to getting to memorize a hundred plus names‚Ä¶ with surnames..;) And then the freshers‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> party that made me a singer overnight! And those assignments and surprise tests‚Ä¶ those night outs at the college‚Ä¶ catching up some early morning sleep at the reception before the next class starts‚Ä¶ Not to forget those times when the north Indians were driven to nuts by some ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>sounds‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> from the tamilians‚Ä¶ and the late night ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>discussions‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>, that were colloquially ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>VeKu‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s (an abbreviation for ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>vetti kootam‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> in Tamil)‚Ä¶   And then some stuff exclusive to IIITB ‚Ä¶ like seeing yourself sleeping on the big screen, thanks to the cameras from all corners‚Ä¶ and being looked at like zoo inmates by some n number of visitors everyday‚Ä¶ and then watching cricket matches in an atmosphere that could beat any stadium hands down‚Ä¶ having greats like Richard Stallman in front of our eyes‚Ä¶ and many many more‚Ä¶   And continuing the excitement yesterday, was the papers, carrying a snap of our batch‚Ä¶ so finally I have achieved something remarkable ‚Ä" my foto in the day‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s paper! And that too in the same frame as some of the greatest luminaries of our time! And some potentialWell jokes apart, the tears of joy and sparkles of pride in my mom‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s eyes definitely made me feel like an achiever‚Ä¶ and this day would be etched in our minds for the rest of our lives‚Ä¶¬† ¬†

Until recently, I have always felt credit cards are a pain in the wrongest of places‚Ä¶ this is essentially bcoz of my dad‚Ä¶ the only thing I remember about him and cards, is that more often than not, he gets charged extra and ends up blasting the bank executive left right and center‚Ä¶ this is quite a common sight in my house, after he gets the monthly bill‚Ä¶ my dad would religiously call up the bank, and demand for an explanation‚Ä¶ and this ofcourse, knowing very well that his efforts would go in vain‚Ä¶   But then recently, I was forced to go in for a credit card‚Ä¶ all I wanted to do was get a mobile connection, and I was deprived of one bcoz I did not have a card!! And the connection providers wouldn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t give a damn even if I showed them my salary slip, employment contract and a ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>decent‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> bank balance too‚Ä¶ all they want is a credit card in my name, so that the liability gets shifted to the bank‚Ä¶ now that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s what you call trusting people!  I had called up this guy, who was selling credit cards for a renowned bank‚Ä¶ actually I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t call him up myself‚Ä¶ when I was bombarded with calls from the bank, I asked them to send a representative‚Ä¶ he was there promptly at my office‚Ä¶ and made me fill up some forms, and get some n number of documents, each for a different purpose‚Ä¶ one would verify my address, my identity, so on and so forth‚Ä¶ and then when he left, he promised that I would be getting my card within 3 weeks‚Ä¶ as in, latest by 3 weeks‚Ä¶   So I was all hopeful of getting this new credit card‚Ä¶ and I had opted for a card with my foto on it‚Ä¶ to get the cheap thrill of seeing myself, everytime I shop with it!  Actually 5 weeks have passed, and I have been desperately trying to contact this guy‚Ä¶ who had played the fool with me‚Ä¶ I tried calling him up, and it wasn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t of any use‚Ä¶ and then yday, I was too happy to spot him in my office reception‚Ä¶ and was even happier that he acknowledged me with a smile! Thank goodness, there were still some traces of hope left‚Ä¶  He was actually talking to another potential customer, when I met him‚Ä¶ and I asked him what had happened to my card‚Ä¶ can anyone guess what I would‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>ve got for an answer? I didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t expect it even in the wildest of my dreams‚Ä¶ With a great amount of hesitation, he told me that he had changed banks‚Ä¶ and was selling the cards of another bank now‚Ä¶ all I could do was laugh aloud at this‚Ä¶   And even worse, was that he started explaining to me the benefits of this new card of this new bank‚Ä¶ he hardly gave me any time to think‚Ä¶ and proceeded with his marketing speech‚Ä¶ guess that‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s how they are trained, to effectively make use of a customer‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s weak moment!  I was insisting that I was more interested in the ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>other‚Ä<sup>TM</sup> bank‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s card‚Ä¶ and he too, with all skills of persuasion, was reiterating that the new bank‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s card is equally good‚Ä¶ actually he said it was even better! The bottomline was that I wanted a card only to get my phone connection done‚Ä¶ I had no intentions whatsoever of using that card for anything other than paying my telephone bills, and in that case, the bank name really didn‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>t matter at all‚Ä¶ but then, the older card had only some half a dozen varieties‚Ä¶ like Gold, Silver, Platinum etc etc‚Ä¶ and the new bank had a card named after virtually every element in Mendeleev‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>s table‚Ä¶ so that made me nearly faint!  By then I had lost all hopes of getting that card‚Ä¶ but on top of my mind was that I had wasted a passport size snap for this! And I also managed to get the phone connection, saying that I have applied for the card and would produce it ‚Ä<sup>~</sup>ASAP‚Ä<sup>TM</sup>..;) But the funniest part is‚Ä¶ my mobile connection also got cut today, thanks to the excess bill that I have incurred in my maiden month of usage!

Over the past month or so, the only thing I have been doing in all the time that I have is attending training‚Ä¶ and it can be logically inferred from the above statement that I have ceased to think for quite a while now‚Ä¶ day in and day out, I come to office, keep staring at my trainer, take in some stuff of what he/she says, leaving out most of the stuff.. doze off in between‚Ä¶ and at the end of the day feel kind of insane‚Ä¶ I have to get back to chatting, checking mails and blogging after the training schedule daily, or else this feeling of insanity jus increases‚Ä¶   In between this absolutely interesting schedule, yesterday I was talking to this friend of mine after quite a few months‚Ä¶ he had attended an interview for a job, and I was enquiring how it went and stuff‚Ä¶  He said it went on fine, and posed one of the interview questions before me‚Ä¶ there is this popular belief in my class that I am good (relatively...;) when it comes to problem solving, hence that question was being posed to me‚Ä¶ I could not answer it at first shot, but I am glad it made me dust out my thinking faculties and do some productive work‚Ä¶    After kind of arriving at an answer, but not quite convinced with myself, I wanted to verify it with my other friend, a genius in his own right‚Ä¶ What ensued was an interesting discussion between us, me being a silent listener for most part of it, and he doing quite a bit of discovery into this stuff‚Ä¶   The question was thus, ‚Äoehow do you plant four trees such that each is equidistant from the other three?‚Äù The answer of course was that it was not feasible‚Ä¶ that we knew when we started the discussion itself‚Ä¶ but I am glad that it was a welcome break from the boring schedule that I normally have‚Ä¶   What made the discussion all the more worthwhile, was that I was doing all this sitting right under the nose of my trainer! My trainer probably thought  was typing some code only with so much enthu... While I was enjoying typing some mails...   If this was early in the morning, the afternoon session was even better... I had a partner in crime, who was sharing my system... and instead of being attentive in the class, he was entertaining me by providing puzzles to solve... He got a peek into my frame of mind, thanks to the sites that I was browsing... And after noticing me spend significant time in some math sites, he was giving me puzzles himself... And thanks to him, at the end of the day, my sanity is safe and sound... Atleast, I feel so...  I feel its only things like this that help break the monotony of corporate life... Or maybe I am feeling the monotony a little too much, thanks to the very recent transition from student life to corporate life... Tomorrow is yet another loooooong day ahead!
