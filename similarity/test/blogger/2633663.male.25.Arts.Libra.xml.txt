This weekend I had a cry-for-help party for myself (even slipping in that phrase on an instant message to a disenfranchised ex-long-distance relationship "cry for help cry for help").  I called all of my friends with a self-fulfilling prophecy that they wouldn't call me back (only self-fulfilling because of my alarmingly good instinct).  I had the plague.  No one wanted to talk to me.  All I needed was a brief moment of human contact.  People repeatedly flaked on their plans with me.  A guy who just recently wanted to stop sleeping with me and be my friend did not in fact want to be my friend at all - he didn't want anything to do with me.  I don't want to believe that this was a situation that I couldn't fix on my own.  But, somehow (grammatical innovation by Barbara Guggenheim) when my friend R called me on Sunday and asked to go to a bar (even though he called ten minutes later to cancel and I told him he wasn't ALLOWED to cancel on me - not today - not on this awful awful day) we did, and all the despair evaporated.  I guess there's no denying that people who need people are I.  I can't help it.  I refuse to die into a state of loneliness.  As ressistant as this town of angels is to becoming my friend, I won't surrender.  I know that out there my future support system is scattered like so many grains of sand.  I know they'll find their way into my shoe.

I saw a something in my half eaten sandwich.  If you take your half eaten sandwich (make sure it has lettuce leafs) and turn it sideways (with the right masticative manicuring) it looks like woman's vagina (not a man's).  I recommend curried chicken salad.  Take some really great pictures of this on like 8 x 10 polaroids and make a name for yourself.  If you've always wanted to be an artist or a photographer, now is the time to start.  Trust me.  I work for a Guggenheim.  Just keep in mind that allowing yourself to see things in food (especially genetalia) is the event horizon for developing a personality fissure, which I advise against.  I also have a bit of advice for new bloggers such as myself.  Let your post sit on your computer screen for a bit before you publish otherwise you'll be republishing with edits every five minutes for the entire work day.  At least, that's what I did.

Matt is so so tired of dating.

One end of me held in your teeth Split and sliding over your buck smirk; The other pinched in your dirty fingers Nonchalantly bruised.  A twisted orange peel: With sticky juices dripping down your chin; Down your wrist,  Your mouth always makes me cockeyed, Looking two ways at once  Then I drop Inertly uncurling My soft white flesh left touching itself.    (c) 2001 Matt Arigo

Having been on 6 dates in the last 6 days I have to say that - well, I'm exhausted.  Last night I went on TWO dates!  And they just happened to be a clear illustration of what I'm going to call the two types of yearning.  Yearning One:  Date A seemed almost desperate for me, like I was an opportunity for him to alter the course of his life.  I wound up being sort of bored with the conversation.  I was a little creeped out by his advances and poorly placed innuendo.  I tried to pass myself off as "crazy" and "depressed" (which is KIND of accurate), talked about my ex-boyfriend, and ended the evening with hint-soaked "I think I should get going."  Tone says a lot.  Yearning Two:  Date B was a spontaneous jaunt for pie.  I said right off the bat that "there will be no typical date talk please."  This is a good technique if anyone wants to use it.  The yearning coming into play here was sort of a yearning to stay strong in our respective points of view and to allow things to develop.  I had a great time (even though I was allergic to the pie and had to get cheese cake - blech), and the night capped off with a sort of nice moment.  He, "Can I call you?"  Me (smile), "yeah."  Point being, Yearning One does not exclude ANYONE.  We all have the potential to get lost in a sort of salvation complex.  If the date-ee plays along, you've just made the first step down the road to codependence (which is endlessly varied and intricate).  Fortunately, it almost always leads to a sort of unwarranted heartbreak instead.  So, be thankful when that guy stands you up, thankful when he doesn't call, thankful when he leaves early - he's doing you a favor.

I'm sort of relaxed, sort of bleary.  Here's the conflict that's been going on in my head:  I try to be a good judge of character.  I'm not, though.  Truth is I have no idea what people are going to do, even if they seem like the nicest person in the world.  Annette Bening is repeating in my head, "No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself.  You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better."  I don't want to have this point of view.  I don't want to be so jaded.  There's a dead end there because I have no idea how to control my plummeting faith in others.  I got stood up this weekend.  It turned out he had a great excuse.  But does that stop me from losing faith?  No.  I can't undo the experience of feeling totally burned.  Friends have been telling me that the key lies somewhere in knowing the difference between being realistic and being jaded.  When all is said and done, my plummeting faith still, fortunately, sets me down safely on the optimistic realist side.  But that doesn't stop me from being riddled with paranoia.

Just thought this was one of the funniest things I ever read.  From TwoP's recap of last weeks   Six Feet Under :  "If that were my laptop, it would be the only thing fitting into that bag, and even the bag might disappear if the computer were big enough to eat itself out, which I kind of suspect it is. Sorry. Computer envy. Because my computer weighs exactly eight hundred and seventeen pounds, and that goes up to eight hundred and eighteen if you count the hernia self-diagnosis guide that came separately entitled Your Portable Computer: Do Not Lift! At least my lack of overwhelmingly fancy things keeps a lid on masked gunmen holding me hostage as they covet and steal my material goods. But when the mere act of picking up your ostensibly portable computer leads to a reminder that the company's outmoded catchphrase may secretly be, "Dude, you're getting crushed by a Dell," you're going to start lusting after the thirteen-inch carrying cases they sell for iBooks at Urban Outfitters. And it will make you very, very sad. But I'm going to stop bitching about my computer now because I'm pretty sure that it can hear everything I'm saying."by   Djb

...ousted The Winter Guest as my new favorite movie.  No comment.  Except if you really know me, that's a big deal.  It's everything I believe in.

My REALLY cheap domain registration service is masking external links as part of my site.  It should be fixed as soon as they process the change.

I've been inspired to take an internal foray on here.  "If you hold on to your Love, it might not be coming back." -Griffin House  Realizing that i miss my life, not my love, not his friends.  Realizing I miss enjoying the smell of waking up.  The intimacy with myself to truly believe that I'm awe-inspiring.  I'm trained to say "oh yeah I forgot..." when someone says something bad about me.  It really perpetuates this sort of...dirge going on in my subconscious...a sort of mourning for beauty.  It has a rhythm.  It pervades.  "Goodbye good.  Goodbye love.  Goodbye joy."  For once.  And for all.  I will dedicate this poem to MYSELF.  Making my two Americas (heh) into one.  A Valediction: forbidding mourning by John Donne   AS virtuous men passe mildly away, Â And whisper to their soules, to goe, Whilst some of their sad friends doe say, Â Â The breath goes now, and some say, no:  So let us melt, and make no noise, Â Â No teare-floods, nor sigh-tempests move, T'were prophanation of our joyes Â Â To tell the layetie our love.  Moving of th'earth brings harmes and feares,  Men reckon what it did and meant, But trepidation of the spheares, Â Though greater farre, is innocent. Â  Dull sublunary lovers love Â Â (Whose soule is sense) cannot admit Absence, because it doth remove Â Â Those things which elemented it.  But we by a love, so much refin'd, Â Â That our selves know not what it is, Inter-assured of the mind, Â Â Care lesse, eyes, lips, and hands to misse. Â Â  Our two soules therefore, which are one, Â Â Though I must goe, endure not yet A breach, but an expansion, Â Â Like gold to ayery thinnesse beate.  If they be two, they are two so Â Â As stiffe twin compasses are two, Thy soule the fixt foot, makes no show Â Â To move, but doth, if the'other doe. Â  And though it in the center sit, Â Â Yet when the other far doth rome, It leanes, and hearkens after it, Â Â And growes erect, as that comes home.  Such wilt thou be to mee, who must Â Â Like th'other foot, obliquely runne; Thy firmnes makes my circle just, Â Â And makes me end, where I begunne.     So now that belongs to me.  For once and for all.    Raining at Sunset by Chris Thile   I have a recurring dream where I'm in an airport and I never get on the plane.  We're talking hours of trying here.  No anxiety.  Just I don't get on the plane.  I think I'm ready now.  1+1=1

Might I go so far as to say thank God to the Apple Music Store?        I'll admit he sounds a little green.  But he's the real deal.  I was gonna say something about Bob Dylan and Neil Young and Jeff Buckley...but I'll give it a rest.  Nice to just get some good strong music from a male vocalist and songwriter who's not a gooey whiner.  No offense to Damien Rice and the likes...or even to the Kings of Convenience.  But House, thanks for handing us your balls.

     Please don't hold this editorial against West Virginia.  This deepens my faith in   Shirley Jackson .

"i have 49 voicemails, my voicemails full, can you help me empty it?" "okay hold down ONE" "it says call failed, exit or retry" "well, is your phone getting a signal?" "what does that mean?" "is your phone getting a signal, like when you can't make a call you have no signal." "umm..." "like in malibu. you have no signal, so you can't make a call. how do you usually tell if you have a signal or not?" "i hit the off button" "you what? why?" "that's how i tell if i have a signal" "okay on the top left of the screen-" "-it says camera or styles" "no, on the top left of the screen there's a small picture of a phone" "you mean on the top right?" "no thats the battery. on the top left" "okay..." "on the top left next to the small picture of the phone, are there any bars?" "there's nothing there" "okay then you have no signal, you have to move to a better location" "i have to move my phone around?" "yeah" "i'll bring it by the office and you can do it later"

     It's been TOO LONG, and I've been waiting with baited breath for this CD.  Maybe it's the solace I knew I'd find in it.  These guys are so lovely, they take care of you while they sing softly to you...a sort of melodic back rub.  Their   site  has a few new videos of theirs as well.  Also if you missed the European release, which I know Micah didn't, Wheatus came out with an ep of some of the songs on that album.  Get it   here .  Nothings verboten this week.  Too many good releases.  The itunes music store is loaded.  This week is proof, if it has a pretty cover, the music is probably just as good.  See for yourself.    One Plus One is One - Badly Drawn Boy     Scissor Sisters   Wish I were rich.  OH!  Except that Moby hack came out with an album that's SUPPOSEDLY b-sides from Play.  Let's stop patronizing this dickwad.

  Howl's Moving Castle   is shooting.  I guess that's a process.  But hell I'm excited.  The last great cell animator.  By the way, in case you were wondering (or hoping)  Home on the Range  is officially Disney's last non-computer animated movie.  Guess they realized their...lack of skill.

This place is a goldmine for concept art. It's called Naimoka.  It's in French.  I have no clue what any of the text means.   

A poem by Dan Brintz:  You know I'm feisty I'm really feisty I'll mow your lawn in the nude I'll wash your doggie And I'll wear leather All in mid-afternoon  Dedicated to Teresa Heinz-Kerry.

For all of you long-time followers out there, there's been a change.  I hope you can adapt.  You can always reach this blog at the same old address.  BUT, how cool is it that now I own   mattarigo.com , and it'll send you right here.

Otay, this is harsh.   

Well then, Justen, you might want to try our very own city's free crossword.  It's challenging, varying in difficulty from week to week, and if you have competitive friends, it will drive you nuts when they finish it before you and tell you about it before you've even begun.  The only thing I like better than FINISHING the LA Weekly Crossword is FINISHING the LA Weekly Crossword...or something like that.    LA Weekly Crossword

Way of the Samurai 2  is apparently poised to be the next  Grand Theft Auto III .  That's enough to get me excited.  Get on it!   

     Justen Deal is a sleeping political power house.  If only he knew.

One of the funniest moments EVER on the Amazing Race last night when Kami and Karli got all super-hero and dove into a lake to swim to an island that they could've walked to like everyone else.  As usual, recap courtesy of twop:  

It's not that good but at LEAST it's anti-two-party-system.   

I'm a sucker for some good shoegaze, all the more when it comes in a pop package.            Ain't they pretty?  I really value adding purchases like this to my album collection.  Although it's basically just great to chill to or drive to or anything, if you DO listen to the words, they're kind of nice.  It's the kind of music that you don't have to pay ANY attention to for it to satisfy you.  It unobtrusively keeps your mood up and your emotions nurtured.  It's actually making me look forward to getting in my car which is more than I can say about ANY album I've bought in a while.  Also, STILL one of my favorite albums. If you like the above, you'll LOVE this.          And this weeks "Satan's Choice", Ashlee Simpson...didn't Kelly Osbourne already come out with that album?  Ouch.

I don't watch his show.  But I've been doing some hunting for some cute geeks.  And this week this geek takes the cake.        He's a host of "The Screen Savers" on TechTV.

       She's known as the Martha Stewart of drag.

Here's a nice quiet way to waste time at work. I happen to be on a mac and I can't get the damn thing to work by registering first or whatever the hell shockwave.com is asking me to do. So, here's the direct link.    Daily Jigsaw

This fag's hilarious.  Probably more so if you speak German.     

        The Door in the Floor  was more like an ode to the early chapters of John Irving's  A Widow for One Year , I'll repeat more like an ode to than an adaptation of. I guess the difference between the two is the love that goes into the former.  If you've read these chapters, you love them, and you might cry 5 seconds into the movie, because you know what this director/writer has done and where he's going with it.    If you haven't read the chapters, this movie is as good at telling a story as Jeff Bridge's character. I don't want to say a THING about the movie, I just want you to go see it.    And finally, props to Kim Basinger for winning an Academy Award and staying human and quiet and real in her performances.

For fulfilling my every dream.  Anyone else have unhealthy obsession with Christmas all year round?  Might I recommend   A Christmas Album  by Bright Eyes?   

It's okay to be a bitch as long as you're a loyal bitch.  Some of my best friends are huge bitches; I can be a huge bitch.  Yet somehow I prefer that to the mental-, emotional-, spiritual-, and cultural-midgets of the world.  I find more and more every day that loyalty is the only important quality in a relationship.  Thinking that way gives all parties involved an enormous freedom to be themselves.  That really does bring happiness and fulfillment.  If you don't believe me, read   The War of Art  by Steve Pressfield.  I HIGHLY recommend.  It will change your life.  If you read it and say, "I'm not ready for this," well then what are you ready for?

A man after my own heart and an adorable geek to boot.   

"Just moments ago, the Federal Marriage Amendment lost in the Senate by a stunning, bipartisan vote of 50-48." -HRC listserv  Woo hoo?  Am I supposed to be happy that half the country thinks banning gay marriage is a GOOD idea?!  Good thing the dudes who wrote the constitution had the forsight to know that, just because HALF of our country can't make that "common sense" thing happen, it shouldn't be grounds for ammending the constitution.

I know a certain Micah that would love to see this.        It's the video for "Bowl of Oranges" by Bright Eyes.  While you're there check out the video for "Lover I Don't Have to Love".  And maybe just MAYBE we'll be able to wait for the concert on October 14th.

A new weekly blog entry devoted to telling you clueless people what to buy.        I'm gonna go out on a limb and call this album WAY better than their last.  "Light and Day" annoys the fuck out of me even though  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  tore my heart out and squeeeeeezed it.  Somehow  they've managed to suck the musk out of their recording.  Thank heaven.  And not your heaven, but Polyphonic Spree's heaven where God's robe is purple and Jesus is doing that thing where he runs in circles around the living room seeing how far he can lean into the centrifugal force before he gets a face full of carpet.  Of course I got a little worried when I saw "Beginning Stages Of..." get panned pretty eloquently by some guy on amazon.com, but then I saw he dubbed Barbra Streisand's "The Movie Album" as "WONDERFUL, WARM BABS."  Now here's what you should NOT buy.  Gotta send a little hate out to Morissey for totally sucking nowadays.    First of the Gang to Die   Don't bother.

Omg, i just messed myself.     HellBent

Every now and then for the hell of it I'm gonna promote the hotness of geeks.  If you look like either of these guys, you just might be my dream man:     Their music is great too.  Check 'em out.    Kings of Convenience   And pay no attention to that girl on their album cover.

I'm back to the personal blog.  I'm finding I need somewhere to talk things out.  Since the last entry, which was clearly a release of SOMEthing, I've pretty much stopped dating.  Except for one person.  It's a little too personal to air on this site, BUT I am willing to declare right here and now that I'm treating it just horribly.  So here's my confession I guess.  I've become a full-time crazy maker.  I'm sending messages such as "I'm crazy about you, but this isn't going to work."  I constantly feel like someone's worst nightmare.  And as much as I try, I just can't stop.  I can't stop kissing him or sleeping with him.  Why don't I just go for it (you ask)?  Well, there are some legitimate reservations that I have.  So, clearly the right thing to do is to end it completely, right?  Because I'm hurting someone, right?  Because I'm leading someone on, right?  I think I have a potential to get caught in what I'm going to call a doggy paddle.  I used have the point of view that when I didn't have everything I needed or wanted, I felt like I was drowning.  I've become pretty good at dealing with those feelings and now when I don't have what I want, I'm very okay.  The doggy paddle still happens though when I manage to GET my head above water.  I have this delusion that once I have something, if I let it go, I WON'T float, I'll just sink to the bottom.  So I'm doggy paddling with this.  I'm kicking and flapping my hands for the security of it all.  Meanwhile, I'm kicking up all these cassiopeoa jelly fish when I just need to relax and float and listen.  This helped.

I've been really hard pressed to find some good info on the upcoming extended release of  The Return of the King .  This article will tell you about the PROCESS of bringing it to DVD.  It satisfied SOME of my curiosity.   

     You'd think they'd do some research first.  I think Wal-Mart would do just fine in the middle of nowhere off of some random highway stop.  People would still go.  It's not like people are walking there.

     This trailer rocks.  What is it about Julianne Moore that makes me swoon?

It actually exists.    George's Blog   AND the guy who maintains it goes to Northwestern.  anelson@northwestern.edu
